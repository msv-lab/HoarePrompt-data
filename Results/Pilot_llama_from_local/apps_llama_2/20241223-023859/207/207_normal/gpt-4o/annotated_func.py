#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the GCD of the original `x` and `y`
    return x
    #The program returns the absolute value of x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, which are the input parameters. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that the GCD of the original `x` and `y` is returned. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `y` is 0 (in which case the GCD is `x`), and when `x` is 0 (in which case the GCD is `y`). The absolute value of the result is implied to be returned, but as the inputs are non-negative integers and the GCD operation does not produce negative results for such inputs, the result is effectively the GCD itself without needing to explicitly calculate an absolute value. The function does not modify the input variables `x` and `y` outside of its local scope.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer and a and b are positive integers.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where m is a non-negative integer, a and b are positive integers, and g is the result of func_1(a, b) which is not equal to 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The value of `g` is equal to 1.
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers, where `m` is less than `k = a + b - 1`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns `(a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` serves as a recursive calculator that accepts three parameters: a non-negative integer `m` and two positive integers `a` and `b`. Based on the values of these parameters and the result of `func_1(a, b)`, it calculates and returns a value. If `func_1(a, b)` does not equal 1, it recursively calls itself with parameters `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g` (where `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`) and multiplies the result by `g`. When `func_1(a, b)` equals 1, it then checks if `m` is less than `a + b - 1`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, it calculates and returns the sum of two series: one from 1 to `a + b - 1` and another from `a + b - 1` to `m`. The function handles potential edge cases such as when `m` equals 0, or when `a` and `b` are at their minimum values (1), and correctly adjusts its calculations based on these scenarios. Additionally, it handles the case when `a` and `b` are both 1, where `g` will be 1, and `m` will be directly used to calculate the sum. However, the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-zero and non-negative value, and its behavior may be undefined if this assumption is not met. Overall, the function provides a way to calculate complex sums based on recursive division and summation formulas, handling various input scenarios and edge cases.
