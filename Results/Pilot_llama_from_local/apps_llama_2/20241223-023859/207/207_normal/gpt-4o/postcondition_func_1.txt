The function `func_2` serves as a recursive calculator that accepts three parameters: a non-negative integer `m` and two positive integers `a` and `b`. Based on the values of these parameters and the result of `func_1(a, b)`, it calculates and returns a value. If `func_1(a, b)` does not equal 1, it recursively calls itself with parameters `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g` (where `g` is the result of `func_1(a, b)`) and multiplies the result by `g`. When `func_1(a, b)` equals 1, it then checks if `m` is less than `a + b - 1`. If true, it returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers. If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, it calculates and returns the sum of two series: one from 1 to `a + b - 1` and another from `a + b - 1` to `m`. The function handles potential edge cases such as when `m` equals 0, or when `a` and `b` are at their minimum values (1), and correctly adjusts its calculations based on these scenarios. Additionally, it handles the case when `a` and `b` are both 1, where `g` will be 1, and `m` will be directly used to calculate the sum. However, the function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` will always return a non-zero and non-negative value, and its behavior may be undefined if this assumption is not met. Overall, the function provides a way to calculate complex sums based on recursive division and summation formulas, handling various input scenarios and edge cases.
