The function determines if it's possible to distribute balloons of different colors among a group of friends such that no friend gets more than a certain number of balloons of the same color. It accepts input in the form of the number of balloons (n), the number of friends (k), and a string of balloon colors (s), then prints 'YES' if the maximum frequency of any balloon color does not exceed the number of friends (k), indicating a possible distribution. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles edge cases, including empty strings, single-character strings, and cases where the number of balloons or friends is at the boundary of the specified range (1 to 100). It does not consider scenarios where the distribution strategy or the exact number of balloons each friend can get is required; its sole output is a feasibility indication.
