Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`. If `c` is in `color_count`, then `color_count[c]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `color_count[c]` is set to 1.**
