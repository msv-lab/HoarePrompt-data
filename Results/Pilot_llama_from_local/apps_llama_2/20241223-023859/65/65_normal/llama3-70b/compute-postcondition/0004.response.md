Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `color_count` is a dictionary that initially was empty, `c` is the first character in `s`. The current value of `c` is a key in the `color_count` dictionary, meaning `c` exists as a key in `color_count`.**
