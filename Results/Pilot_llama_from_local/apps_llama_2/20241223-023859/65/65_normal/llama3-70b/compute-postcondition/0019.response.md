Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string (possibly empty), if `s` is not empty, `c` is the last character in `s`, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum frequency of characters in `s` or 0 if `s` is empty. The current value of `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`.**
