Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in `s`. If `c` is already a key in `color_count`, then the count of `c` in `color_count` is incremented by 1 and the new count of `c` is returned. Otherwise, `c` is added as a key to `color_count` with a count of 1.**
