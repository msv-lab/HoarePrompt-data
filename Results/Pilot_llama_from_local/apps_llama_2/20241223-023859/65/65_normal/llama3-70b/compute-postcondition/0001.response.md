The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `s`. This input is a string, and since the previous value of `s` was also a string, the type of `s` remains the same, but its value changes to the user's input. The length of `s` is now equal to the length of the input string. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is the input string of unknown length, containing the user's input.**
