The given code takes two integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial state mentions that the input contains two integers `n` and `k` and a string `s`, but the given code only processes the integers `n` and `k`.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` does not directly affect the string `s` or its length. However, it does set the values of `n` and `k` based on the input provided.

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100`, after executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold integer values within this range as input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and there is a string `s` of length `n` containing lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, denoting the colors of the balloons, waiting to be processed.**
