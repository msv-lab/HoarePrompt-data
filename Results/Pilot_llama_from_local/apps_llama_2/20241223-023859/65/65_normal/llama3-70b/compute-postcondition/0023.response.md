Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string (possibly empty), if `s` is not empty, `c` is the last character in `s`, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum frequency of characters in `s` or 0 if `s` is empty. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed, indicating that the maximum frequency of characters in `s` is greater than `k`.***
