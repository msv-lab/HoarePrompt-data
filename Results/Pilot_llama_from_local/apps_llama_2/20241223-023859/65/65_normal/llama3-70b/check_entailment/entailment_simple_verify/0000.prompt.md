You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends (k), but this is not sufficient to determine if Kefa can give out all the balloons. 

The program fails to consider the case where the total number of balloons is more than the number of friends, and the colors are distributed in such a way that it's impossible to give out all the balloons without repeating a color for some friends. 

For example, if we have 5 balloons of different colors and only 3 friends, the program will print 'NO' because the maximum count of any color (1) is less than the number of friends, but the real reason we can't give out all the balloons is that we have more balloons than friends.

However, in this problem, we should consider the maximum occurrence of each color. If the maximum occurrence is more than the number of friends, then it's impossible to distribute the balloons without repeating a color for some friends.

A correct approach would be to count the occurrences of each color and check if the maximum count is more than the number of friends.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
6 3
aaabbb

In this case, the program will print 'NO' because the maximum count of any color (3) is more than the number of friends, and indeed it's impossible to distribute the balloons without repeating a color for some friends. 

But the explanation above shows why the given solution does not work for all possible cases, like when the total number of balloons is more than the number of friends, and the colors are distributed in such a way that it's still possible to give out all the balloons without repeating a color for some friends. 

A correct solution should iterate over the color counts and use a greedy approach to assign the balloons to the friends.

Here is a correct code:
```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    friends = [0]*k
    for count in color_count.values():
        for i in range(k):
            if friends[i] < count:
                friends[i] += 1
            else:
                break
    if sum(friends) == n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Input contains two integers n and k, such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100, where n represents the number of balloons and k represents the number of friends, and a string s of length n containing lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, denoting the colors of the balloons.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string (possibly empty), `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`. If `s` is empty, then `color_count` is an empty dictionary.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string (possibly empty), if `s` is not empty, `c` is the last character in `s`, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum frequency of characters in `s` or 0 if `s` is empty. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed, indicating that the maximum frequency of characters in `s` is greater than `k`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
