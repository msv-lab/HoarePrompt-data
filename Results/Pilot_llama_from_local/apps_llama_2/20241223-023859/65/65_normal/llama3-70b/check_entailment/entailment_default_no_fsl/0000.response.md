Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not consider the total number of balloons of the same color that need to be distributed among the friends. It only checks if the maximum frequency of any balloon color exceeds the number of friends. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that each friend can receive at most one balloon of the same color.

A counterexample can be constructed where the maximum frequency of any balloon color is less than or equal to the number of friends, but the total number of balloons of a particular color is greater than the number of friends. For instance, consider the input:

5 3
aabbc

In this case, the maximum frequency of any balloon color is 2, which is less than the number of friends (3). However, there are 2 'a's, 2 'b's, and 1 'c', and it is impossible to distribute these balloons among 3 friends such that no friend receives more than one balloon of the same color. The code will incorrectly output 'YES' for this input.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
