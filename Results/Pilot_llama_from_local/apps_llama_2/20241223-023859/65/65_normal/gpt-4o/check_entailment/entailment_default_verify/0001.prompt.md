You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program starts by taking the number of balloons (`n`) and the number of friends (`k`) as input, along with a string (`s`) representing the colors of the balloons.

2. It then creates a dictionary (`color_count`) to store the count of each balloon color. This allows it to efficiently keep track of the number of balloons of each color.

3. The program then checks if it's possible to distribute the balloons among the friends without any friend getting two balloons of the same color. It does this by iterating over the counts of each balloon color in the `color_count` dictionary and checking if any count is greater than the number of friends (`k`). If it finds any such count, it sets `can_distribute` to `False`.

4. Finally, based on the value of `can_distribute`, it prints either 'YES' (if the balloons can be distributed) or 'NO' (if they cannot).

This program works correctly because it accurately checks the condition required for distributing the balloons among the friends: that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. This condition is equivalent to checking that the maximum frequency of any balloon color is less than or equal to the number of friends.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program handles all possible scenarios, including the edge cases where `n` or `k` is 1, or where all balloons are of the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function determines whether it is possible to distribute balloons of different colors to a certain number of friends, given the constraint that no friend can receive more than one balloon of the same color. The function takes three inputs: the number of balloons (`n`), the number of friends (`k`), and a string representing the colors of the balloons (`s`). It returns 'YES' if it is possible to distribute the balloons among the friends without any friend receiving more than one balloon of the same color, and 'NO' otherwise. The function handles edge cases where the input string `s` is empty, in which case it will print 'YES' because no distribution is needed. Additionally, the function does not validate the inputs, so it assumes that `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of lowercase letters. After execution, the program's state is determined by the output ('YES' or 'NO') printed to the console, indicating whether the balloon distribution is possible under the given conditions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
