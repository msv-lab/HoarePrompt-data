Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code accurately implements the problem description, handling all potential cases as specified. It correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute balloons of different colors to a certain number of friends without any friend receiving more than one balloon of the same color.

The code works as follows:
- It first reads the number of balloons (`n`) and the number of friends (`k`).
- Then it reads a string (`s`) representing the colors of the balloons.
- It counts the occurrences of each color using a dictionary (`color_count`).
- For each color count, it checks if the count exceeds the number of friends (`k`). If it does, it sets `can_distribute` to `False`.
- Finally, it prints 'YES' if `can_distribute` is `True` (meaning all balloons can be distributed without violating the rule), and 'NO' otherwise.

The code handles the examples provided correctly:
- For the input `4 2` and `aabb`, it correctly outputs 'YES' because each friend can receive two balloons of different colors (e.g., one friend gets `a` and the other gets `b`).
- For the input `6 3` and `aacaab`, it correctly outputs 'NO' because there are not enough friends to distribute the `a`-colored balloons without any friend receiving more than one `a`.

Given the problem constraints (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100), the code should work correctly for all valid inputs, assuming the inputs are provided as specified (i.e., integers for `n` and `k`, and a string of lowercase letters for the balloon colors).
