You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The program starts by taking the number of balloons (`n`) and the number of friends (`k`) as input, along with a string (`s`) representing the colors of the balloons.

2. It then creates a dictionary (`color_count`) to store the count of each balloon color. This allows it to efficiently keep track of the number of balloons of each color.

3. The program then checks if it's possible to distribute the balloons among the friends without any friend getting two balloons of the same color. It does this by iterating over the counts of each balloon color in the `color_count` dictionary and checking if any count is greater than the number of friends (`k`). If it finds any such count, it sets `can_distribute` to `False`.

4. Finally, based on the value of `can_distribute`, it prints either 'YES' (if the balloons can be distributed) or 'NO' (if they cannot).

This program works correctly because it accurately checks the condition required for distributing the balloons among the friends: that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. This condition is equivalent to checking that the maximum frequency of any balloon color is less than or equal to the number of friends.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program handles all possible scenarios, including the edge cases where `n` or `k` is 1, or where all balloons are of the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is the number of balloons and k is the number of friends, both are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and s is a string representing the colors of the balloons, where each character in the string is a lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`. If `s` is empty, `color_count` is an empty dictionary.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`, and `can_distribute` is `False` if any character count in `color_count` is greater than `k`, otherwise `can_distribute` is `True`.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`. If `can_distribute` is `True`, 'YES' has been printed to the console. If `can_distribute` is `False`, there exists at least one character count in `color_count` that is greater than `k`, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
