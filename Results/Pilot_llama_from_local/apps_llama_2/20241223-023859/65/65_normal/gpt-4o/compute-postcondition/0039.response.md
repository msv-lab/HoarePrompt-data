Functionality: **The function determines whether it is possible to distribute balloons of different colors to a certain number of friends, given the constraint that no friend can receive more than one balloon of the same color. The function takes three inputs: the number of balloons (`n`), the number of friends (`k`), and a string representing the colors of the balloons (`s`). It returns 'YES' if it is possible to distribute the balloons among the friends without any friend receiving more than one balloon of the same color, and 'NO' otherwise. The function handles edge cases where the input string `s` is empty, in which case it will print 'YES' because no distribution is needed. Additionally, the function does not validate the inputs, so it assumes that `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of lowercase letters. After execution, the program's state is determined by the output ('YES' or 'NO') printed to the console, indicating whether the balloon distribution is possible under the given conditions.**
