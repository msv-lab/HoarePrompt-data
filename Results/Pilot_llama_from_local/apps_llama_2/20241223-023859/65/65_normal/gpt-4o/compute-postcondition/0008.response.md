Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `color` is the first character in the string `s`. `color_count` is a dictionary where `color` is a key, if `color` was already in `color_count`, its count is incremented by 1, otherwise `color` is added to `color_count` with a count of 1.***
