Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`. The current value of `can_distribute` is `True`, meaning that no character count in `color_count` is greater than `k`.**
