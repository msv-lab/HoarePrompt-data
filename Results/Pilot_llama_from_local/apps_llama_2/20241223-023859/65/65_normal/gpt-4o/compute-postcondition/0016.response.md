Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `color` is the third character in the string `s`, `color_count` is a dictionary where the count of the first character is incremented by 1, the count of the second character is incremented by 1 from its initial count if it existed, or added with a count of 1 if it did not exist, and if `color` is already in `color_count`, the count of `color` is incremented by 2, otherwise `color_count[color]` is 1**
