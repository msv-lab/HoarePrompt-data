Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`. If `can_distribute` is `True`, 'YES' has been printed to the console. If `can_distribute` is `False`, there exists at least one character count in `color_count` that is greater than `k`, and 'NO' has been printed to the console.***
