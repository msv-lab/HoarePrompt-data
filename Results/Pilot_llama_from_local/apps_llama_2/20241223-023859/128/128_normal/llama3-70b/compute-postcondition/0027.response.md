Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`, `i` is the previous `i` plus 1 and `i` is less than `n`. If `i` is less than `f`, `sold` is increased by `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`. Otherwise, `sold` is increased by `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.**
