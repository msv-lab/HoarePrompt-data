The code appends a tuple of the current values of `k` and `l` to the `days` list. The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. The `days` list now contains the previous values of `(k, l)` and an additional tuple of the current values of `(k, l)`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `f` is an input non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` is a list containing the previous values of `(k, l)` and an additional tuple of the current values of `(k, l)`**
