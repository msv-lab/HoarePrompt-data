The code appends the current values of `k` and `l` to the `days` list. The previous values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `l` are not affected. However, the `days` list now contains an additional tuple of the current values of `(k, l)`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `f` is an input non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `k` and `l` are input non-negative integers, `days` is a list containing the previous values of `(k, l)` and an additional tuple of the current values of `(k, l)`**
