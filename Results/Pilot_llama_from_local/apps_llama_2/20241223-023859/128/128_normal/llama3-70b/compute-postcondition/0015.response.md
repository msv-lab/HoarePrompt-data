Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`, `sold` is 0, `i` is an integer where the current value of `i` is less than `f` and `i` is 0 or more**
