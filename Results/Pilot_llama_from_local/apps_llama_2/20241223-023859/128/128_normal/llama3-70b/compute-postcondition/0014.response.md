According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, which means it could be 0, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute. Additionally, `i` needs to be initialized as it is the loop counter.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`, `sold` is 0, `i` is 0**
