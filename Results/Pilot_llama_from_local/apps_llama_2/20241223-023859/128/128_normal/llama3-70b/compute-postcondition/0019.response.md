Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`. If `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is `sold + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`. Otherwise, `sold` is `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`, and this `i` is not less than `f`.***
