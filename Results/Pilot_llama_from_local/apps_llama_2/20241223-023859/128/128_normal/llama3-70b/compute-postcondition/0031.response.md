Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the maximum number of products that can be sold over a period of `n` days, where each day has a certain number of products and clients. It operates on `n` non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)`, representing products and clients for each day, and two non-negative integers `n` and `f`, where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`. The function sorts the days based on the difference between the number of clients and products in descending order, then calculates the total sales by selling either `min(2 * products, clients)` products for the first `f` days or `min(products, clients)` products for the remaining days. The function does not handle cases where the input values are not valid integers or are outside the specified ranges, and it does not return any value, instead printing the total sales directly. The function will terminate and print the calculated total sales, leaving the input variables `n`, `f`, and the list of day pairs in their final state.**
