The given input line updates the values of `n` and `f` based on user input. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the user's input into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `f`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer, `f` is an input non-negative integer where 0 ≤ `f` ≤ `n`, and there are `n` pairs of non-negative integers (k, l) where 0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9.**
