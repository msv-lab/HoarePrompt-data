The code updates the values of `k` and `l` by taking new input values and assigning them to `k` and `l` using the `map` function. The previous values of `k` and `l` are lost. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `f` is an input non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` is a list containing the previous values of `(k, l)` and an additional tuple of the previous values of `(k, l)` and the new values of `(k, l)`**
