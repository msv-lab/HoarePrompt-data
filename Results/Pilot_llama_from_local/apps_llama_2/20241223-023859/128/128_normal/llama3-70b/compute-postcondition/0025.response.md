The value of `sold` is increased by the minimum of `days[i][0] * 2` and `days[i][1]`. The value of `days[i][0]` is a non-negative integer and the value of `days[i][1]` is also a non-negative integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`i` is still the previous `i` plus 1 and `i` must be less than `n`. The value of `n` is still a positive integer, `f` is still a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is still a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`, `i` is the previous `i` plus 1, `i` must be less than `n`, `sold` is increased by `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`.**
