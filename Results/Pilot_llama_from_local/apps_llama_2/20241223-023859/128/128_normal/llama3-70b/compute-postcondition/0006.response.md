The code `k, l = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them into `k` and `l`, and converts them to integers. 

The values of `n` and `f` are not affected, and the list `days` still contains the tuple `(k, l)`, but `k` and `l` are updated to the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `f` is an input non-negative integer where `0 â‰¤ f â‰¤ n`, `k` and `l` are input non-negative integers, `days` is a list containing a tuple of the previous values of `(k, l)`**
