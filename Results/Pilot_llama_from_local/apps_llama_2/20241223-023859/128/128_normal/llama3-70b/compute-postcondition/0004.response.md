The code `days.append((k, l))` appends a tuple containing the values of `k` and `l` to the `days` list. The values of `n` and `f` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f` is an input non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `k` and `l` are input non-negative integers where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, `days` is a list containing a tuple `(k, l)`**
