According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the previous `i` plus 1, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new `i`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer where `0 ≤ f ≤ n`, `days` is a list containing `n` tuples of non-negative integer pairs `(k, l)` where `0 ≤ k, l ≤ 10^9`, sorted in descending order by `l - k`, `i` is the previous `i` plus 1, `i` must be less than `n`**
