The code initializes an empty list called `regular_sales`. The initial state includes variables `n`, `f`, and `days`, which are not modified by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, and `regular_sales` is an empty list**
