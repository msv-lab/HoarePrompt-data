To determine the output state, let's break down the given initial state and the provided Python code.

The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`.
- `days` is a list of `n` tuples with at least 2 tuples.
- `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`.
- `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing one element, `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`.

The Python code is:
```python
regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
```
This code appends the minimum of `k` and `l` to the `regular_sales` list. Here, `k` and `l` are the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`. 

Since `regular_sales` initially contains the minimum of the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`, and the code appends the same minimum value to `regular_sales`, the `regular_sales` list will now contain this minimum value twice.

The output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`.
- `days` is a list of `n` tuples with at least 2 tuples.
- `regular_sales` is a list containing two instances of the minimum of the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`.
- `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing one element, `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples with at least 2 tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing two instances of the minimum of the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing one element, `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are the first pair of values in the second tuple of `days`**
