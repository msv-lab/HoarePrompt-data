The given code introduces a new variable `potential_sales_increase` and assigns it an empty list value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is an empty list, and `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list**
