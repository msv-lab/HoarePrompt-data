The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= f <= n, and `days` is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers representing the number of products and the number of clients for each day. After executing the function body, the function returns the total sales, which is the sum of the original sales (minimum of products and clients for each day) plus the sum of the potential sales increase for the first f days (difference between the minimum of 2*products and clients and the minimum of products and clients for each of the first f days). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, f, and days, and returns the total sales by summing the original sales for all days and adding the potential sales increase for the first f days.**
