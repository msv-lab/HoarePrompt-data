Functionality: **The function calculates the total sales for a given number of days, taking into account the original sales and potential sales increase for the first f days. It accepts parameters n (the number of days), f (the number of days to consider for potential sales increase), and days (a list of tuples containing the number of products and clients for each day). The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of the original sales (minimum of products and clients for each day) plus the sum of the potential sales increase for the first f days (difference between the minimum of 2*products and clients and the minimum of products and clients for each of the first f days). The function handles edge cases where f is 0 or n, and it also handles cases where the number of products or clients is 0 for a given day. The function assumes that the input parameters are valid (n is a positive integer, 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n tuples with non-negative integers).**
