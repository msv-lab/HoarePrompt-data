To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is a positive integer and at least 3.
   - `f` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `f` <= `n`.
   - `days` is a list of `n` tuples with at least 3 tuples.
   - `regular_sales` includes an additional element which is the minimum of `k` and `l`.
   - `potential_sales_increase` is a list that will be appended with a calculated value.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code `potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))` calculates the difference between the minimum of `2 * k` and `l`, and the minimum of `k` and `l`, then appends this difference to `potential_sales_increase`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `n`, `f`, and `days` are not affected by the code.
   - `regular_sales` is not directly modified by the given code snippet.
   - `potential_sales_increase` is updated by appending a new calculated value to it. The value appended is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, which is based on the values of `k` and `l`.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since `n`, `f`, and `days` do not change, their conditions remain the same.
   - The state of `regular_sales` remains as it includes an additional element which is the minimum of `k` and `l`.
   - `potential_sales_increase` now includes an additional element which is the result of `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.

Given the above analysis, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples with at least 3 tuples, `regular_sales` includes an additional element which is the minimum of `k` and `l`, and `potential_sales_increase` includes an additional element which is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`.**
