The `potential_sales_increase` list is sorted in descending order. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a sorted list in descending order containing the difference between the minimum of `2 * k` and `l` and the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple in `days`, `total_sales` is the sum of all elements in `regular_sales`.
