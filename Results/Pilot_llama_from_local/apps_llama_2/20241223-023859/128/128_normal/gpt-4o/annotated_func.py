#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers representing the number of products and the number of clients for each day.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the difference between the minimum of `2 * k` and `l` and the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns the total sales, which is the sum of the original sales (minimum of k and l for each day) plus the sum of the potential sales increase for the first f days (difference between the minimum of 2*k and l and the minimum of k and l for each of the first f days), where 0 <= f <= n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total sales for a given number of days, taking into account the original sales and potential sales increase for the first f days. It accepts parameters n (the number of days), f (the number of days to consider for potential sales increase), and days (a list of tuples containing the number of products and clients for each day). The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of the original sales (minimum of products and clients for each day) plus the sum of the potential sales increase for the first f days (difference between the minimum of 2*products and clients and the minimum of products and clients for each of the first f days). The function handles edge cases where f is 0 or n, and it also handles cases where the number of products or clients is 0 for a given day. The function assumes that the input parameters are valid (n is a positive integer, 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n tuples with non-negative integers).
