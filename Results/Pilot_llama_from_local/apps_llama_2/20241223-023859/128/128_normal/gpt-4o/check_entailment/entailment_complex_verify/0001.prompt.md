You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correctly implemented based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. It calculates the total number of products that can be sold on a normal day (without a sell-out) by taking the minimum of the number of products available (`k`) and the number of clients (`l`).
2. It calculates the potential increase in sales for each day if a sell-out is chosen by taking the minimum of twice the number of products available (`2 * k`) and the number of clients (`l`), and subtracting the normal day sales.
3. It sorts the potential sales increases in descending order, so the days with the largest potential increases are chosen first for sell-outs.
4. It adds the sum of the potential sales increases for the `f` chosen days to the total sales, which gives the maximum total number of products that can be sold.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* If `f` is 0, it means no sell-outs are chosen, and the program returns the total sales for normal days.
* If `f` is equal to `n`, it means all days are chosen for sell-outs, and the program returns the maximum possible sales.
* If `k` is 0 for a day, it means no products are available, and the program correctly returns 0 sales for that day, even if a sell-out is chosen.
* If `l` is 0 for a day, it means no clients will come, and the program correctly returns 0 sales for that day, even if a sell-out is chosen.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two non-negative integers representing the number of products and the number of clients for each day.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` tuples, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the difference between the minimum of `2 * k` and `l` and the minimum of `k` and `l` for each tuple in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns the total sales, which is the sum of the original sales (minimum of k and l for each day) plus the sum of the potential sales increase for the first f days (difference between the minimum of 2*k and l and the minimum of k and l for each of the first f days), where 0 <= f <= n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total sales for a given number of days, taking into account the original sales and potential sales increase for the first f days. It accepts parameters n (the number of days), f (the number of days to consider for potential sales increase), and days (a list of tuples containing the number of products and clients for each day). The function returns the total sales, which is the sum of the original sales (minimum of products and clients for each day) plus the sum of the potential sales increase for the first f days (difference between the minimum of 2*products and clients and the minimum of products and clients for each of the first f days). The function handles edge cases where f is 0 or n, and it also handles cases where the number of products or clients is 0 for a given day. The function assumes that the input parameters are valid (n is a positive integer, 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n tuples with non-negative integers).

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
