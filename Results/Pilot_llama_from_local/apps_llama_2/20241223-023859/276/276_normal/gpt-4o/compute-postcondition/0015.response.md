The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which should be two non-empty strings `s1` and `s2` consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000. However, the provided function definition only includes a single parameter `s`. For clarity and based on the description, it seems there might be a confusion in the parameter naming. Assuming the function is intended to take two string parameters `s1` and `s2` as described, the return value is calculated based on the positions of '1's in these strings. 

Given `n` as the length of the strings `s1` and `s2`, and `q` approximately equal to 1.618033988749895, the function returns the sum of `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1` for all indices `i` where the character at index `i` in either `s1` or `s2` is '1'. If `n` is 0 (which, based on the constraints, should not occur since the strings are non-empty), it returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-empty strings `s1` and `s2` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and return the calculated sum based on the positions of '1's in these strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, non-empty strings s1 and s2 consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the sum of q raised to the power of n - i - 1 for all indices i where the character at index i in either s1 or s2 is '1', with n being the length of s1 or s2.**
