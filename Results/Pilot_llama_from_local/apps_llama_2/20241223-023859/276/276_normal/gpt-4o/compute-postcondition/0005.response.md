`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000. The value of `q` is approximately `1.618033988749895`. The initial value of `value` is `0`. `n` must be greater than 0 and is the length of either `s1` or `s2`. `i` is `0`. The current value of `s` at index `i` is '1'. 

`value` is updated by adding `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1`. Given `i` is `0`, this simplifies to `q` raised to the power of `n - 1`.

Therefore, `value` becomes `0 + q ** (n - 1)` which simplifies to `q ** (n - 1)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately `1.618033988749895`, `value` is `q ** (n - 1)`, `n` is the length of either `s1` or `s2` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is '1'**
