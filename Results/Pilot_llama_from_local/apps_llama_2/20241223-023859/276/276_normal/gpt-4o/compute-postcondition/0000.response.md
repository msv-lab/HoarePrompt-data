The code calculates the value of `q` using the equation `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which is the formula for the golden ratio. 

The value of `(5 ** 0.5)` is approximately `2.23606797749979`. 

Adding `1` to this value gives approximately `3.23606797749979`. 

Dividing this result by `2` gives approximately `1.618033988749895`. 

Therefore, `q` is assigned the value approximately equal to `1.618033988749895`. 

The states of the other variables, `s1` and `s2`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000, `q` is approximately `1.618033988749895`**
