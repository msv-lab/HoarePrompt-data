To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, let's analyze both the original assessment and the annotated version.

The original assessment states that the program is correct, meeting all requirements of the problem description. This assessment is based on several points:
1. The correct definition of `q` as the golden ratio.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the decimal value of a given string in the golden system notation.
3. The program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the correct result.

The annotated version of the code provides detailed states of the program at different points, which aligns with the original assessment:
- Before the function call, `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.
- After the `for` loop in `func_1`, `value` is the sum of `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1` for all indices `i` where the character at index `i` in the string is '1', or 0 if `n` is 0, which correctly implements the calculation of the decimal value in the golden system.

The key points to consider are:
- The program correctly implements the calculation of decimal values for the golden system.
- It handles the comparison and prints the result correctly based on the calculated decimal values.

However, the annotated version hints at the function's limitations, such as not handling cases where the input string contains characters other than '0' and '1' or is longer than 100000 characters. Nevertheless, the problem statement assumes valid input will always be provided, which aligns with the program's design.

Given the information and analysis:
- The program correctly implements the logic for calculating decimal values from golden system notation.
- It compares and prints the results as per the requirement.
- The assumption of valid input aligns with the program's design and the problem's constraints.

Therefore, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct holds true based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code.

Final: **True**
