Correctness: **True**

The program is correct. It accurately implements the golden system notation and compares two numbers written in this system. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`. The comparison logic is also correct, printing the expected output based on the relative values of the two numbers.

The use of `q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2` is a direct implementation of the mathematical definition of `q` as `q = (âˆš5 + 1) / 2`. The loop that calculates the decimal value of the number correctly handles the special property of the golden system where `q^2 = q + 1`.

All the provided examples work as expected, and it is unlikely that there are any edge cases that would break the code. For instance, the program correctly handles numbers of different lengths, and it should work correctly for all possible inputs consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The program's implementation is straightforward and does not contain any obvious bugs or incorrect assumptions.
