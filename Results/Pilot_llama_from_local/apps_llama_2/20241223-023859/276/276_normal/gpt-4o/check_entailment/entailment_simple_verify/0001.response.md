Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

The problem description requires comparing the decimal values of two numbers in the golden system notation. The program defines the value of `q` as `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which is the golden ratio, and calculates the decimal value of a given string in the golden system notation using the `func_1` function.

The `func_1` function iterates over each character in the string, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of `q` to the total value. This is in accordance with the problem description, which states that the decimal value of a number in the golden system is the sum of the digits multiplied by the corresponding powers of `q`.

The program also correctly handles the comparison of the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the correct result ('>', '<', or '=').

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program is working as expected. The state of the program before and after the function call is as expected, and the return value of the `func_1` function is the correct decimal value of the input string.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment and conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
