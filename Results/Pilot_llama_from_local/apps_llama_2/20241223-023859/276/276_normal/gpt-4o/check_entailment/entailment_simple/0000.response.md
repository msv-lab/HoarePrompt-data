Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the decimal value of two numbers written in the golden system notation and compares them.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program reads two non-empty strings `s1` and `s2` consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, which represents the input numbers in the golden system notation.

2. The `func_1(s)` function calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system notation. It uses the formula `value = ∑(a_i * q^(n-i-1))` where `q = (√5 + 1) / 2`, `n` is the length of the string, and `a_i` is the character at index `i` in the string (either '0' or '1').

3. The program calls `func_1(s1)` and `func_1(s2)` to calculate the decimal values of `s1` and `s2`, respectively.

4. Finally, the program compares the decimal values of `s1` and `s2` and prints the result as specified in the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases correctly because it assumes valid input and uses the correct formula to calculate the decimal values of the numbers in the golden system notation. The calculation of the decimal values is based on the properties of the golden system notation, specifically the equation `q^2 = q + 1`, which is not explicitly used in the code but is the basis for the calculation of the decimal values.

The only potential issue with the program is that it uses floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce small rounding errors. However, given the constraints of the problem, the lengths of the input strings are relatively small (up to 100000), and the values of `q` are not extremely large, so the rounding errors are unlikely to affect the correctness of the program.
