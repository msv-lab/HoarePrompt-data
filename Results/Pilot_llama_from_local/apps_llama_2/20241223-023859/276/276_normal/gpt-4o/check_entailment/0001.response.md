Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program correctly defines the value of `q` as `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which is the golden ratio.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a given string in the golden system notation. It does this by iterating over each character in the string, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of `q` to the total value.
3. The program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the correct result ('>', '<', or '=').

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Different lengths of input strings
* Leading zeros in the input strings
* Input strings containing only '0's or only '1's

All the examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the program.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
