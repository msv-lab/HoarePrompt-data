Correctness: **True**

The given code correctly implements the comparison of two numbers in the "golden system" as described in the problem. It calculates the decimal value of each number using the formula provided and then compares these values to determine which number is larger.

The function `func_1(s)` accurately calculates the decimal value of a given number `s` in the golden system. It iterates over each character in the string, adding the corresponding power of `q` to the total value whenever it encounters a '1'.

The main part of the code reads two numbers from input, calculates their decimal values using `func_1(s)`, and then compares these values to print the correct output ('>', '<', or '=').

The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code. For instance, in the first example, the code correctly calculates that the first number (`1000`) is smaller than the second number (`111`), resulting in the output `<`. 

The code does not handle cases where the input string contains characters other than '0' and '1' or is longer than 100000 characters, but according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid, so this does not affect the correctness of the code.

Overall, the code correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases as described in the problem, assuming valid input.
