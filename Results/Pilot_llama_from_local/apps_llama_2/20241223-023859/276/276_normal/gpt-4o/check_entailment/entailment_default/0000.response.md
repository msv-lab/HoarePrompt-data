Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the problem description, comparing two numbers represented in the "golden system" notation and determining which one has a larger decimal value. 

Here's why the code works:
- The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system by summing up the values of '1' digits multiplied by the corresponding powers of the golden ratio `q`.
- The `q` value is correctly calculated as `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which is the golden ratio.
- The code iterates through each character in the input strings `s1` and `s2`, calculates their decimal values using `func_1`, and then compares these values to determine the output.
- The examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, the code calculates the decimal values of '1000' and '111' and prints '<' because the decimal value of '111' is indeed larger.
- The code assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with a length not exceeding 100000. Under this assumption, the code works correctly for all potential cases.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any edge cases that the code does not handle. Therefore, based on the provided information, the code accurately implements the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
