Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem description requires the program to take two numbers written in golden system notation as input and determine which one has a larger decimal value.
2. The program reads two input strings `s1` and `s2`, each consisting of '0' and '1' characters, and calculates their decimal values using the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number by summing up the powers of `q` for each '1' digit in the number, where `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895.
4. The program then compares the decimal values of `s1` and `s2` and prints '>' if `s1` is larger, '<' if `s2` is larger, and '=' if they are equal.
5. The program assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., two non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.

Since the program correctly implements the golden system calculation and comparison, and assumes valid input, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Note that the program does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., empty strings, strings with characters other than '0' and '1', or strings longer than 100000 characters). However, since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the program.
