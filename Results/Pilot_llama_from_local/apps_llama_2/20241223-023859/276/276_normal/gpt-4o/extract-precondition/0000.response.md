It seems like there is a mistake in the function definition provided, as it only takes one string as an input, whereas the problem requires comparing two strings. A more suitable function definition for this problem would be:

```python
def func_1(s1, s2):
```

Precondition: **s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.**
