The function accepts a single parameter, a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with a length not exceeding 100000. It calculates and returns the sum of `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of `n - i - 1` for all indices `i` where the character at index `i` in the string is '1', where `n` is the length of the string. If the string is empty, it returns 0. The function does not modify the input string and does not handle cases where the input string contains characters other than '0' and '1' or is longer than 100000 characters. The function only processes the input string `s` and does not use any other input parameters, such as `s1` and `s2`, which are mentioned in the annotations but not present in the actual code.
