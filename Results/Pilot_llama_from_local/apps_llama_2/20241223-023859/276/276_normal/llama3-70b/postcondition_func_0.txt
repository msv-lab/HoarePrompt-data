The function accepts a string `s` containing only '0' and '1' characters with a length at most 100000, and returns a decimal value calculated from the sum of products of each '1' character in the reversed string `s` and a constant `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of their corresponding indices, where `s` is either a valid binary string or an empty string (if the input string only contains '0' characters, the function will return 0.0). The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty, contains characters other than '0' and '1', or has a length exceeding 100000, and may raise exceptions or produce unexpected results in such cases. Upon successful execution, the function returns the calculated decimal value, leaving the input string `s` unchanged.
