It seems like the function definition you provided is incomplete. Based on the problem description, it seems like the function should be defined as:


```python
def func_1(s1, s2):
```

Precondition: **s1 and s2 are non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000.**
