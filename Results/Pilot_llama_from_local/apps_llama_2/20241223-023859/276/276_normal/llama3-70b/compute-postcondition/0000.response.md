The given Python code calculates the value of `q` using the mathematical expression `(math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`, which is approximately equal to 1.618033988749895. This value is also known as the golden ratio.

The initial state mentions that `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000. The calculation of `q` does not affect the values of `s1` and `s2`.

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895 or exactly (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2**
