The value of `decimal` is set to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`s1` and `s2` are still non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000, `q` is still approximately 1.618033988749895 or exactly (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2.
