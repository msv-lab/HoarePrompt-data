The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string containing only '0' and '1' characters, with a length not exceeding 100000. After executing the function body, the function returns the decimal value, which is the sum of the products of each '1' character in string `s` (in reverse order) and a constant `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of its corresponding index. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `s` of '0' and '1' characters and return the calculated decimal value based on the positions of '1' characters in the reversed string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of '0' and '1' characters, returns the decimal value calculated from the sum of products of '1' characters and a constant `q` raised to the power of their corresponding indices in the reversed string.**
