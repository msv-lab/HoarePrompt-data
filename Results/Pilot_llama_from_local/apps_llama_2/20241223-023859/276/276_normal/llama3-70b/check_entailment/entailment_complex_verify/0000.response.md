Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I have analyzed the program's correctness. 

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct (**True**), and I agree with this assessment. The program accurately implements the golden system comparison as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the decimal value of the golden system numbers using the formula $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$ and compares the two calculated decimal values to print the corresponding comparison result.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the program's behavior and states at different points in the program. The annotations describe the expected input and output, as well as the program's behavior when handling valid inputs.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a golden system number by iterating over the reversed string and summing up the products of the digit and the corresponding power of `q`. The comparison logic is also correct, as it compares the calculated decimal values and prints the corresponding comparison result.

The program assumes that the input will be valid, and the annotated version notes that it may raise exceptions or produce unexpected results if the input string is empty, contains characters other than '0' and '1', or has a length exceeding 100000. However, this assumption is justified, as the problem description guarantees that the input will be valid.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
