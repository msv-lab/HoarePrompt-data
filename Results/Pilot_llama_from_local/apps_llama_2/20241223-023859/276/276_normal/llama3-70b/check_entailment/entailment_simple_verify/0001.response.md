After carefully reviewing the problem description, the original code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have determined that the program is indeed correct. 

The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(s)` accurately calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`. The assessment also correctly notes that the main program compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct result.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the program's behavior. The annotations confirm that the program correctly calculates the decimal value of each input number and that the comparison is performed correctly. The annotations also highlight that the program handles valid inputs, which is in line with the assumption stated in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, I conclude that the program is correct. The program accurately implements the problem description, and the annotations confirm its correctness.

Final: **True**
