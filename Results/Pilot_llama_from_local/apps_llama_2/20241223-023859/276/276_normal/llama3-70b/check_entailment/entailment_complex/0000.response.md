Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads two lines of input, each containing a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters, which matches the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Converting to Decimal**: The `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number by summing the products of each digit in the reversed string and `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of its corresponding index. This is in line with the formula provided in the problem description: $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

3. **Comparing Numbers**: After calculating the decimal values of both input numbers, the program compares them and prints the correct comparison operator ('>', '<', or '=') based on their decimal values. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Handling Input Constraints**: Since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the constraints on input (non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000) are implicitly met.

Overall, the program accurately follows the problem description and correctly determines which of two numbers written in the golden system notation has a larger decimal value.
