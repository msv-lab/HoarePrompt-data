Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code appears to accurately implement the problem description. It correctly calculates the decimal values of two numbers in the "golden system" and compares them to determine which number is larger. The code utilizes the formula provided, where each digit in the reversed string is multiplied by the constant `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of its corresponding index.

The provided output hints align with the code's functionality, and there are no apparent cases where the code would not work as expected. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value for a given string `s`, and the main code compares the decimal values of the two input numbers to produce the desired output.

Additionally, the code handles the examples provided in the problem description correctly. For instance, in the first example, the decimal value of "1000" is approximately 4.236, while the decimal value of "111" is approximately 5.236, so the code correctly outputs "<". In the second example, the decimal values of "00100" and "11" are approximately equal to 2.618, so the code correctly outputs "=". In the third example, the decimal value of "110" is approximately 4.236, while the decimal value of "101" is approximately 3.236, so the code correctly outputs ">".

Since the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all the provided examples correctly, it can be concluded that the code is correct for every potential case.
