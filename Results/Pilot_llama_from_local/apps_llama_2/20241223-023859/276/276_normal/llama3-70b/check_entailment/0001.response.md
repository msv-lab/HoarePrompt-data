Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`. The main program then compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct result.

The use of `enumerate(reversed(s))` in `func_1(s)` is also correct, as it iterates over the digits of the input string in reverse order while keeping track of the index. This allows the function to correctly calculate the decimal value of the number.

The program handles all potential cases, including numbers of different lengths and numbers with leading zeros. The use of `math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` to calculate `q` is also correct, as it is the definition of `q` given in the problem description.

Overall, the program is well-structured and correct, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs. The examples provided in the problem description also match the output of the program, which further confirms its correctness.
