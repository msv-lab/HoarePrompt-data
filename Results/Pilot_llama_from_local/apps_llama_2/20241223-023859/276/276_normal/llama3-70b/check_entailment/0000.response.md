Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to accurately implement the golden system comparison as described in the problem. 

Here's why:

1. It correctly calculates the decimal value of the golden system numbers using the formula $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.
2. It compares the two calculated decimal values and prints the corresponding comparison result (">", "<", or "=").
3. The program handles all potential cases, including:
   - When the two input strings have different lengths.
   - When the two input strings have the same length but different digits.
   - When the two input strings are identical.
   - When the input strings contain leading zeros (although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem, the program still handles it correctly).

No edge cases or potential errors were found in the given code. It correctly follows the problem description and should work as expected for all possible inputs. 

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a golden system number by iterating over the reversed string (to align with the formula) and summing up the products of the digit and the corresponding power of `q`. 

The comparison logic is also correct, as it compares the calculated decimal values and prints the corresponding comparison result.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
