Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the golden system notation and compares two numbers written in this system. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given string in the golden system notation by summing the products of each '1' character and the constant `q` raised to the power of their corresponding indices. This is done for each input string `a` and `b`, and then the decimal values are compared to print the result.

The code handles all potential cases according to the problem description, including strings of '0' and '1' characters with a length at most 100000. The function assumes that the input will be valid and does not handle cases where the input string is empty, contains characters other than '0' and '1', or has a length exceeding 100000, but this is acceptable according to the problem statement.

The provided examples are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, the decimal value of `1000` is calculated as `((sqrt(5) + 1) / 2)**3`, and the decimal value of `111` is calculated as `((sqrt(5) + 1) / 2)**2 + ((sqrt(5) + 1) / 2) + 1`, which results in the correct output `<`.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, so I conclude that the code is correct.
