Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Requirements**: The problem requires comparing two numbers represented in the "golden system", which uses the base `q = (sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`. The goal is to determine which number has a larger decimal value.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The program defines `func_1(s)` that calculates the decimal value of a given number `s` in the golden system. It uses the formula for decimal value calculation: `decimal = Î£(a_i * q^(n-i))` where `a_i` are the digits of the number, `q` is the base, and `n` is the length of the number.
   - Since the input strings `a` and `b` are non-empty and contain only '0's and '1's, the function correctly calculates their decimal values by iterating through the characters in reverse order and summing their contributions (`int(c) * q ** i`).
   - After calculating the decimal values for both input numbers (`decimal_a` and `decimal_b`), the program compares them and prints the result as `>`, `<`, or `=` based on whether `decimal_a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `decimal_b`, respectively.

3. **Correctness Analysis**: 
   - The calculation of the decimal value in `func_1(s)` follows the specified formula, ensuring that each digit's contribution is correctly weighted by `q` raised to the power of its position.
   - The comparison of `decimal_a` and `decimal_b` and the printing of the result according to the problem's requirements are also correctly implemented.

4. **Assumptions about Input**: Given that the problem statement and the task assume valid input (non-empty strings of '0's and '1's with a length of at most 100000), the program is designed to process such input correctly and does not need to handle invalid cases.

In conclusion, the program adheres to the problem description and calculates the decimal values of the input numbers represented in the golden system correctly, followed by a comparison that yields the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct in the context of the given problem description and assumptions about the input.
