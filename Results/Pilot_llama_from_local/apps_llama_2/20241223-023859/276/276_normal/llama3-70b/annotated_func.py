#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters, and the length of each string does not exceed 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings containing only '0' and '1' characters, `s` (being either `s1` or `s2`) is a string with a length at most 100000, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `decimal` is the sum of the products of each character in `s` (in reverse order) and `q` raised to the power of its corresponding index, `i` is the length of `s` minus 1, and `c` is the first character of `s`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal value, which is the sum of the products of each '1' character in string `s` (in reverse order) and `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of its corresponding index, where `s` is either `s1` or `s2`, both being non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters with a length at most 100000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` containing only '0' and '1' characters with a length at most 100000, and returns a decimal value calculated from the sum of products of each '1' character in the reversed string `s` and a constant `q` (approximately 1.618033988749895) raised to the power of their corresponding indices, where `s` is either a valid binary string or an empty string (if the input string only contains '0' characters, the function will return 0.0). The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty, contains characters other than '0' and '1', or has a length exceeding 100000, and may raise exceptions or produce unexpected results in such cases. Upon successful execution, the function returns the calculated decimal value, leaving the input string `s` unchanged.
