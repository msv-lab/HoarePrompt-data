Precondition: **The input consists of two integers n and m (2 <= n, m <= 50) followed by n lines, each containing m integers. Each integer is either 0 or 1, representing the elements of matrix A. The goal is to transform matrix B into matrix A, where B is initially a matrix of the same size as A with all elements set to 0, by performing operations that set 2x2 submatrices of B to 1.**
