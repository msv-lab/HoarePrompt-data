Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always follow the problem description. 

The problem description states that the goal is to transform matrix B into matrix A, where B is initially a matrix of the same size as A with all elements set to 0, by performing operations that set 2x2 submatrices of B to 1.

However, the program has a bug in the way it generates the operations to transform matrix B into matrix A. 

In the given program, it checks for each 2x2 submatrix of A whether at least one cell is 1 but not all four cells are 1. If this condition is met, it appends the position of the top-left cell of the submatrix to the list of operations. 

But this approach can lead to incorrect results because it does not take into account the fact that performing an operation on a 2x2 submatrix will set all four cells of the submatrix to 1, regardless of their original values.

For example, if the matrix A is 
```
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will append the positions (1, 1) and (1, 3) to the list of operations because the corresponding 2x2 submatrices have at least one cell that is 1 but not all four cells are 1. 

However, performing the operation at position (1, 1) will set all four cells of the submatrix to 1, which means that the cell at position (1, 2) will be set to 1, even though its original value in matrix A is 0. 

This means that the program does not always generate a correct sequence of operations to transform matrix B into matrix A.

A correct program should take into account the effects of each operation on the cells of matrix B and generate the operations in a way that ensures that the final state of matrix B is equal to matrix A. 

In this case, the program should output -1 because it is impossible to transform matrix B into matrix A by performing the given operations, as the original problem description states. 

Therefore, the given program does not follow the problem description in all cases, and its correctness is **False**.
