Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The issue lies in the way it handles the operations. The program checks each 2x2 submatrix of A and if at least one cell is 1 but not all cells are 1, it adds the position of the submatrix to the `ops` list. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results because it doesn't consider the fact that setting a 2x2 submatrix of B to 1 can affect other cells in A.

In particular, the program doesn't check if a cell in A is already covered by a previously added operation. As a result, it can add redundant operations that don't actually change the state of B.

Moreover, the program doesn't consider the case where a cell in A is 0 but is covered by a 2x2 submatrix of B that contains other cells with 1s in A. In this case, the program should not add an operation for this submatrix, but it currently does.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will add operations for the submatrices at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2), even though the cell at position (2,2) is 0 in A. This is incorrect because setting the 2x2 submatrix at position (2,2) to 1 would change the state of B in a way that doesn't match A.

Overall, the program's approach to generating operations is not correct and can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. A correct solution would need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a backtracking algorithm, to ensure that the operations are correct and minimal.
