Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not check if the operation performed to make the current 2x2 submatrix of B equal to the corresponding submatrix of A would disrupt any previously performed operations. However, upon closer inspection, I realize that the program is not trying to transform matrix B into matrix A by actually performing the operations. Instead, it is calculating the theoretical minimum number of operations required to do so.

The output hints provide a different perspective on the program's functionality. It states that the function calculates the minimum number of 2x2 submatrix operations required to transform a matrix B of the same size into matrix A. This means that the program is not actually performing the operations, but rather outputting the theoretical minimum number of operations required to do so.

With this new understanding, I believe that the original assessment is not entirely accurate. The program does not need to check for disruptions to previously performed operations because it is not actually performing the operations. Instead, it is simply outputting the positions of the operations that would be required to transform matrix B into matrix A.

However, the program still has limitations. It does not handle cases where a single operation can make two or more 2x2 submatrices of B equal to the corresponding submatrices of A. This can lead to redundant operations and make the program output more operations than necessary.

Despite these limitations, the program does meet the problem description in the sense that it outputs the number of operations and the positions of the operations if the number of operations does not exceed 2500. It also handles edge cases where the input matrix A has dimensions between 2 and 50, and where the number of operations is either within or exceeds the limit of 2500.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the program is correct in the sense that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. However, it may not always output the minimum number of operations required to transform matrix B into matrix A.

Final: **False** 

The reason I chose False is that the code does not check for cases where a 2x2 operation would contradict the matrix A. For example, if we have the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will try to set B_{1,1}, B_{1,2}, B_{2,1}, B_{2,2} to 1 to match the first 2x2 submatrix of A. However, this would also set B_{1,2} to 1, which contradicts the value of A_{1,2}. The program does not handle this case correctly. 

In order to make the code correct, it should check for cases where a 2x2 operation would contradict the matrix A and handle them accordingly. One way to do this would be to iterate over the matrix A and only add a 2x2 operation to the list of operations if it would not contradict any other values in the matrix A. 

Here is a revised version of the code that handles these cases:
```python
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if (A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1) and not (A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
```
