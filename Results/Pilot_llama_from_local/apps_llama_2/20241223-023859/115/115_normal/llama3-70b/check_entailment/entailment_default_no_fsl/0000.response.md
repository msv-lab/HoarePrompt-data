Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The main issue lies in the condition where it checks if a 2x2 submatrix operation is needed. It checks if any of the elements in the 2x2 submatrix is 1, and if so, it adds the operation to the list. However, this approach is incorrect because it doesn't consider the fact that a single 2x2 operation can cover multiple cells.

For example, if the input matrix is:
```
1 1
1 1
```
The program will output:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
However, this is incorrect because only one 2x2 operation is needed to cover the entire matrix. The correct output should be:
```
1
1 1
```
This shows that the program does not correctly handle all cases. Another example where the program fails is when the input matrix has dimensions 2x2 and all elements are 1. In this case, the program will output 4 operations, but only 1 operation is needed.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where a single 2x2 operation can cover multiple cells. This can be done by keeping track of the cells that have already been covered by a previous operation and avoiding duplicate operations. 

Also, another problem with the current implementation is that it does not actually check if the operations will result in a matrix equal to A. It simply assumes that if a cell is 1 in A, then a 2x2 operation is needed at that cell. However, this is not necessarily true. The program should be modified to check the result of the operations and ensure that the resulting matrix is indeed equal to A. 

Lastly, the problem also requires handling the case where it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A, but the current implementation does not consider this case correctly. For example, if the input matrix is:
```
1 0
1 0
```
The program will output:
```
2
1 1
2 1
```
However, the correct output should be -1 because it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A using the given operations.
