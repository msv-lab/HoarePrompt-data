Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to generate the sequence of operations to transform matrix B into matrix A. 

The program checks each 2x2 submatrix of A and performs an operation if any of the elements in the submatrix is 1. However, this approach can lead to situations where the program tries to fill a submatrix that is already partially filled, resulting in an incorrect transformation.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
```

In this case, the program will generate operations to fill the submatrices, but it will not correctly transform matrix B into matrix A, because it does not consider the interactions between adjacent submatrices.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as using a breadth-first search or a dynamic programming algorithm to find the minimum sequence of operations required to transform matrix B into matrix A. 

The given program does not handle such cases correctly, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
