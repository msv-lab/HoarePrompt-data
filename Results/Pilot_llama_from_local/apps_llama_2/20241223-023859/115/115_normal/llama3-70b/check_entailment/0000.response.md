Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. One issue with the program is that it does not check if the operation performed to make the current 2x2 submatrix of B equal to the corresponding submatrix of A would disrupt any previously performed operations.

For example, if we have the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will try to set B_{1,1}, B_{1,2}, B_{2,1}, B_{2,2} to 1 to match the first 2x2 submatrix of A. However, this would also set B_{1,2} to 1, which contradicts the value of A_{1,2}. The program does not handle this case correctly.

Another issue with the program is that it does not check for the case where a single operation can make two or more 2x2 submatrices of B equal to the corresponding submatrices of A. This can lead to redundant operations and make the program perform more operations than necessary.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and is considered incorrect.
