To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m - 1):`, which means that the loop will iterate over the range of values from 0 to `m - 2`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `ops`) do not depend on the loop variable `j` and therefore remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1; if at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then the tuple `(3, 1)` is added to `ops`.**
