The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the tuple `(3, 3)` is added to `ops`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` remains an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` remains 2, `j` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` is greater than 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list of tuples with the tuple `(3, 3)` added to it**
