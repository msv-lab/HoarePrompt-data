To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
- The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.
- The state of `ops` depends on the values of certain elements in `A`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
```

This line of code appends a new tuple to the `ops` list. The tuple contains the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the tuple `(2, 2)` is appended to `ops`.

The state of `n`, `m`, `A`, and the condition regarding the elements of `A` that influences `ops` initially remains unchanged by this operation. The values of `i` and `j` also remain unchanged as the increment operation is only applied within the context of creating the tuple to be appended to `ops`, not as a direct modification to `i` or `j` themselves.

Therefore, considering the initial conditions and the effect of the code snippet, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
- The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 1.
- `ops` includes the tuple `(2, 2)` in addition to its initial content, which depends on the values of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, and `A[2][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` includes the tuple `(2, 2)` and its initial content which is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly `(2, 1)` if at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1.**
