The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. So, `i + 1` is 1 and `j + 1` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 3)` in addition to its previous contents, which may include `(1, 2)` if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**.
