According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and if at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list of tuples containing `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and `(2, 1)`, otherwise `ops` remains a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`.**
