The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to any variables in the given code, the state of the variables remains the same. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, `i`, and `j` are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and we move to the next iteration of the loop, `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1)` are all 1**
