Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` includes the tuple (2, 3) and other tuples that depend on the values of `A`.***
