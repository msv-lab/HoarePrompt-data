To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we'll consider the loop's behavior based on the provided code and output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over the `ops` list, printing the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` for each operation in the list.

Given that:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive),
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive),
- The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1,
- `i` is `n - 2`,
- `j` is `m - 2`,
- `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500,

We observe from the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations that:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` do not change during the loop's execution. These variables are not modified by the loop.
- The `ops` list is iterated over, and for each iteration, the current operation `op` is processed by printing `op[0]` and `op[1]`.
- The loop will execute as many times as there are operations in the `ops` list.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The `ops` list has been fully iterated over, meaning all operations in the list have been processed (i.e., `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed for each operation).
- If the `ops` list is empty (i.e., its length is 0), the loop does not execute at all, and the state of the variables remains the same as their initial state.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, and all operations in the `ops` list have been printed if the list is not empty.**
