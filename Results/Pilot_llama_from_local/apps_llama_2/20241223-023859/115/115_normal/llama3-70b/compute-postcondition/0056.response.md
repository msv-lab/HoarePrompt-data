Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` is greater than 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list of tuples as initially defined. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop if there is one. Otherwise, the execution proceeds without adding any new tuples to `ops` based on the condition that checked for all four elements being 1.***
