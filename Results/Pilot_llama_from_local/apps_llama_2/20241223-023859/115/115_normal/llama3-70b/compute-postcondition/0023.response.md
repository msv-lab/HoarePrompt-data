According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m - 2` but for the loop to start, `j` should be `0` because the loop iterates over `range(m - 1)`. The state of `n`, `A`, `i`, and `ops` does not affect the execution of the loop, but their initial state should still be recorded.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`**
