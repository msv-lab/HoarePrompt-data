Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1. If all `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, then we move to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the execution proceeds without any changes to the variables.**
