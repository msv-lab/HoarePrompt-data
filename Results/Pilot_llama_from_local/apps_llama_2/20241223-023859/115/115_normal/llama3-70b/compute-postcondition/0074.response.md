Functionality: **The function takes input of two integers n and m, and a matrix A of size n x m with binary values. It calculates the minimum number of 2x2 submatrix operations required to transform a matrix B of the same size into matrix A. The function then prints the number of operations and the positions of the operations if the number of operations does not exceed 2500. If the number of operations exceeds 2500, the function prints -1. The function does not actually transform matrix B into matrix A, but rather outputs the theoretical minimum number of operations required to do so. The function handles edge cases where the input matrix A has dimensions between 2 and 50, and where the number of operations is either within or exceeds the limit of 2500.**
