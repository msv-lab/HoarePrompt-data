Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is a list (potentially updated based on the previous iteration's conditions), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution of the if-else block completes without any further changes.***
