The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no changes made to the variables within the loop before the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and if at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list of tuples containing `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and `(2, 1)`, otherwise `ops` remains a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
