The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not provided with any loop in the given code, the `continue` statement doesn't have any effect on the variables. The values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2**
