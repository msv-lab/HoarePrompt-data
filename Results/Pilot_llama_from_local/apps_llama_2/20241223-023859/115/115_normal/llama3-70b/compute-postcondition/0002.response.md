The code `ops = []` initializes an empty list `ops`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or the matrix `A`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1, and `ops` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1, and `ops` is an empty list**
