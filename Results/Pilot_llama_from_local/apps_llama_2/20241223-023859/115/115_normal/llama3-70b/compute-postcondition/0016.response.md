According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the number of columns `m` in the matrix `A`. If `j` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is between 3 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2**
