Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then we proceed to the next iteration with the same values. Otherwise, the execution continues with the current state of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` unchanged.***
