The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we will assume that this `continue` statement is part of a loop that iterates over the matrix `A` or some other iteration based on `i` and `j`. Given that no specific loop structure is provided, we will consider the general effect of `continue` on the program flow.

Since `continue` only skips to the next iteration of the loop and does not alter any variable's value, the state of the variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, `i`, `j`) remains unchanged. The program will move on to the next iteration, potentially incrementing loop counters (if the loop is a `for` loop) or moving to the next step in a conditional loop structure (if it's a `while` loop), but without explicit loop structure, the exact behavior on `i` and `j` cannot be determined.

However, without explicit modifications to `i` and `j` or knowing the exact loop structure, we must assume their values do not change due to the `continue` statement alone. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the understanding that the program flow has skipped to the next iteration of the loop it is embedded within.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is a list (potentially updated based on the previous iteration's conditions), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
