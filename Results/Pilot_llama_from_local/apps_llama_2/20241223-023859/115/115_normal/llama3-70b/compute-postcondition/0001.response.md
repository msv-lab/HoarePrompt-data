The values of `n` and `m` are used to create the matrix A, where each row of the matrix is created by taking an input of `m` integers and mapping them to integers. 
The states of `n` and `m` are not affected, but the value of the matrix A is changed, because the input to create the matrix A is populated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix A consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1, populated by input.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix A consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1, populated by input.**
