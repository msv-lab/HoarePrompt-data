The input values of `n` and `m` are obtained from the input and converted to integers using the `map` function. The values of `n` and `m` are assigned to the variables `n` and `m`, respectively. 

The input values of `n` and `m` are within the range 2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50. 

The code does not affect the matrix A, which is still composed of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1.

The Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the matrix A still consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix A consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, with each integer being either 0 or 1.**
