To determine the output state, we first analyze the given code and the initial state. The initial state provides information about variables `n`, `m`, matrix `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops`. The code snippet given is `print(len(ops))`, which prints the length of the `ops` list. This operation does not modify any variables but provides output based on the current state of `ops`.

Given that `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, the code simply prints this length. It does not alter the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops` itself; it merely reports the number of elements in `ops`.

Thus, the output state remains largely unchanged from the initial state, with the addition that the length of `ops` has been printed. However, since the problem asks for the output state in terms of variable assignments and conditions rather than printed output, we focus on the variables' states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500, and the length of `ops` has been returned as output.**
