The list `ops` is updated by appending the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The value of `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so `(i + 1, j + 1)` equals `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)` which equals `(1, 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)` (potentially updated based on the previous iteration's conditions), `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution of the if-else block completes without any further changes.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1**
