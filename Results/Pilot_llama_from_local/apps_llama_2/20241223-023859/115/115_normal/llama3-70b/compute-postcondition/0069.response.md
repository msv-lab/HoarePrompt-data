To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the current state.

The for loop statement is `for op in ops:`, which means it will iterate over each operation in the `ops` list.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
- The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `j` is `m - 2`
- `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1
- The length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 1
- `op` is the second operation in the `ops` list
- The values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed

Since `op` is the second operation in the `ops` list, for the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next operation in the list. 

The state adjustments needed for the loop to execute again are:
- `op` should now be the third operation in the `ops` list, because the loop has already executed for the first two operations.
- The length of `ops` should still be less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 1, but since we're not adding or removing operations, this condition remains unchanged.
- Other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`) are not directly affected by the loop iteration over `ops`, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 1, `op` is the third operation in the `ops` list**
