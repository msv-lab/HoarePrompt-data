The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined without additional context. However, assuming it is part of a loop, the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values; it merely controls the flow of the program, causing it to move on to the next iteration of the loop if there is one.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive),
- `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 2,
- The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 2,
- `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`, possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1; if at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then the tuples `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)` are added to `ops`.

Since the `continue` statement does not affect variable values but rather the flow of the program, and without specifics on the loop it's part of, the variables' values remain unchanged. Thus, the state of the variables after the execution of the given code snippet remains the same as their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` is greater than 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ops` is a list of tuples as initially defined, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop if there is one.**
