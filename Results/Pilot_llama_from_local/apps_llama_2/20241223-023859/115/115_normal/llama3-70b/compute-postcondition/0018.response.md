Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then the state of the program remains the same. Otherwise, the state of the program remains the same as the initial state, with `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` retaining their initial values, and `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)` if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.***
