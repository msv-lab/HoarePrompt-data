The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the given constraints, it is implied that the function will operate on a matrix A of size n x m, where n and m are integers between 2 and 50, and each element of the matrix is either 0 or 1. 

The return value of the function is not explicitly stated, but based on the goal of transforming matrix B into matrix A by performing operations that set 2x2 submatrices of B to 1, we can infer that the function will return a transformed matrix or a result indicating whether the transformation was successful.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to transform a matrix B of size n x m with all elements initially set to 0 into a given matrix A of the same size, where each element is either 0 or 1, by performing operations that set 2x2 submatrices of B to 1, based on the input matrix A.
Functionality: **The function transforms a matrix B of size n x m into a given matrix A by setting 2x2 submatrices of B to 1.**
