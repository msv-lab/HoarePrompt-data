Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and if at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list of tuples containing `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and `(2, 1)`, otherwise `ops` remains a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`. If `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[1][2]`, and `A[2][2]` are all 1, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution continues with the current state.***
