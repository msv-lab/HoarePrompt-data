According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. If the list has at least 1 operation, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500. For the loop to be executed, `ops` must have at least 1 operation, and `op` is the first operation in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 0, `op` is the first operation in the `ops` list**
