Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, if at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1)` is 1, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `ops` being an empty list, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.**
