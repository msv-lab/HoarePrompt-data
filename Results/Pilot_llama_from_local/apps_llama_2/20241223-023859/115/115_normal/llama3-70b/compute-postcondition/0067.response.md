According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. If the list has at least 2 operations, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` has a length less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 0, `op` is the first operation in the `ops` list, and `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `ops` must have at least 2 operations, and `op` must be the second operation in the `ops` list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 1, `op` is the second operation in the `ops` list**
