The code only contains a print statement, which does not modify the state of any variables. It simply prints the value -1 to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1 with more than 2500 elements, and the value -1 has been printed and returned at the output state.**
