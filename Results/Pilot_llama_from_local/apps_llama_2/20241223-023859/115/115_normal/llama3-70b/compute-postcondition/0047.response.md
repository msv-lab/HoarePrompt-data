The code appends a new tuple to the `ops` list. The new tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. 

The value of `i + 1` is 3 and the value of `j + 1` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1, and the tuple `(3, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1, and the tuple `(3, 1)`**
