The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there's no loop specified in the given code, the impact of `continue` alone without a loop is undefined in the provided context. However, based on the initial state provided and the fact that `continue` does not inherently modify variables or data structures, we proceed with the understanding that the state of variables and the matrix `A` remains unchanged.

The initial state includes: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` includes tuples that depend on the values of `A`.

Given the `continue` statement does not directly alter these variables or the matrix `A`, and assuming it's part of a loop that isn't shown, the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remain as initially stated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ops` includes tuples that depend on the values of `A`, and we continue to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.**
