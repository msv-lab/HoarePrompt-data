According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again for the next column. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. Also, `m` should be at least 3 for the loop to execute again because the loop needs to have at least one more iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`, possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1; if at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then the tuples `(3, 1)` and `(3, 2)` are added to `ops`.**
