To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables and the matrix `A`. The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple to the list `ops`, where the tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive),
- `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive),
- `A` is a matrix with `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is 2,
- The condition regarding `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1"` does not directly affect the variables' values but determines the flow of the program. Since the code to append to `ops` is executed, it implies the condition for continuing to the next iteration of the enclosing loop is not met, meaning not all of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1.

The value of `i` is 1, and `j` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 2, and `j + 1` equals 3.

After executing the code, the list `ops` will include an additional tuple `(2, 3)`.

Therefore, the output state considering all initial conditions and the changes made by the code is:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive),
- `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive),
- `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is 2,
- `ops` includes tuples that depend on the values of `A`, and now specifically includes the tuple `(2, 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 (inclusive), `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ops` includes the tuple (2, 3) and other tuples that depend on the values of `A`.**
