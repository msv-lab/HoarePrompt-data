Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, indicating that the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right elements of the current 2x2 submatrix of `A` are all 1.**
