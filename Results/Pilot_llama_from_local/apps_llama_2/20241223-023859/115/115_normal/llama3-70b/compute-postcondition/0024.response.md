Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, indicating that the first and second rows and first and second columns of the matrix `A` (at indices `i`, `i + 1`, `j`, and `j + 1`) all contain the value 1.**
