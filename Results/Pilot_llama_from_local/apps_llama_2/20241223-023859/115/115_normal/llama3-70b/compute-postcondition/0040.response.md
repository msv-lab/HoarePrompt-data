To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code checks each pair of adjacent elements in the matrix `A` (horizontally and vertically) and appends a tuple to the `ops` list if at least one of the elements is 1, but not all four elements are 1.

After analyzing the loop code, we can observe that:

1. `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop, so its value will still be an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
2. `m` also remains unchanged, and its value will still be an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
3. The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, and its contents do not change during the loop.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 and does not change throughout the loop.
5. The variable `j` iterates over the range `m - 1`, so after the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `m - 1`.
6. The `ops` list is initially a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`. During the loop, additional tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` are appended to the list if the conditions are met.

Considering these observations, we can conclude that:

- If the loop executes, `ops` will contain the initial tuples `(1, k)` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where the conditions are met.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `m` is less than 2), `ops` will remain unchanged as the initial list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`, but since `m` is between 2 and 50, this situation will not occur.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1.**
