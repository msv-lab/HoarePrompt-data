Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` includes the tuple `(2, 2)` in addition to its initial content which is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly `(2, 1)` if at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `ops` remains unchanged as a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly `(2, 1)` if at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1.***
