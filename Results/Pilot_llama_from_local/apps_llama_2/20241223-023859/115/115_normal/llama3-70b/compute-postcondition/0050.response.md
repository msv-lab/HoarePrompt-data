The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since the initial state does not specify a loop, the effect of `continue` is undefined in this context. However, assuming it is part of a loop that iterates over some conditions or elements, the `continue` statement itself does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops`. 

Therefore, after executing the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the execution. The loop, if any, will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` is a list of tuples containing the initial tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and possibly additional tuples `(2, j)` for each `j` where at least one of `A[1][j]`, `A[2][j]`, `A[1][j + 1]`, `A[2][j + 1]` is 1, but not all four are 1; if at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then the tuple `(3, 1)` is added to `ops`, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
