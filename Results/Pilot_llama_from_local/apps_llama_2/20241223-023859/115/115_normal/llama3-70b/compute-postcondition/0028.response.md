The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are used to calculate the new tuple, where `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. So, `i + 1` equals 2 and `j + 1` equals 1.

The new tuple `(2, 1)` is appended to the list `ops`, which initially contains tuples of the form `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and also contains the tuple `(2, 1)`. The current value of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1` are such that at least one of them is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list of tuples containing `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1` and `(2, 1)`, and at least one of `A[1][0]`, `A[2][0]`, `A[1][1]`, `A[2][1]` is 1.**
