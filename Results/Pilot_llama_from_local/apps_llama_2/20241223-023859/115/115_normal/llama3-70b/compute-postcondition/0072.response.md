Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`. If the list `ops` has more than 2500 elements, the value -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, all operations in the `ops` list have been printed if the list is not empty.**
