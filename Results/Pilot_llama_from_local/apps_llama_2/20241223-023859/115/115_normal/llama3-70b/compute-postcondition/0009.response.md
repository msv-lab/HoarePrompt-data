The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, and the current values of `i` and `j` do not change. The state of the variables `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1)` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1)` is 1**
