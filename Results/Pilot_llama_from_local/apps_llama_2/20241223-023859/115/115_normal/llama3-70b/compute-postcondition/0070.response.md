The code prints the first two elements of the `op` tuple, which is the third operation in the `ops` list. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, `ops` do not change. The `op` is still the third operation in the `ops` list, and its values `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed. 

The state of the other variables is not affected by the print statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 1, `op` is the third operation in the `ops` list, and the values `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `ops` is a list of tuples containing the positions where at least one adjacent cell is 1, but not all four cells are 1, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500 and greater than 1, `op` is the third operation in the `ops` list, and the values `op[0]` and `op[1]` have been printed.**
