The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, in this case, since there's no loop provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement itself doesn't directly affect the variables or their values. It essentially means we move on to the next iteration of the loop that this statement is presumably part of, without altering the current state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive),
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2,
- The matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is 0,
- `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`,
- The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1.

The `continue` statement does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops`. It simply proceeds to the next iteration of the loop it's enclosed within, without modifying the current state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and at least 2, the matrix `A` consists of `n` lines, each containing `m` integers with values 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` where `k` ranges from 1 to `m - 1`, and the values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, and we proceed to the next iteration.**
