Correctness: **False**.

The code does not correctly solve the problem because it only checks for the presence of 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1 in matrix A and performs operations accordingly. However, it does not handle cases where a single cell in A is 1 and there is no 2x2 submatrix that can cover it.

For example, consider the following matrix A:

```
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

In this case, the code will not find any 2x2 submatrix with all elements equal to 1, and therefore, it will not perform any operations. However, since the top-left cell of A is 1, the code should return -1, indicating that it is not possible to transform matrix B into matrix A.

Another case where the code fails is when there is a single row or column of 1s in matrix A. For instance:

```
1 1 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

The code will not correctly handle this case because it only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1, and it does not consider the case where a single row or column of 1s needs to be transformed.

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
