You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 50 and 2 <= m <= 50, and A is a 2D list of integers with n rows and m columns where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 for each 2x2 submatrix in the original `A` starting at `(i, j)` with all elements equal to 1, and 0 otherwise, `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such submatrix.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, either `A` is equal to `B` and `i` is `n` and `j` is `m`, or the function has returned -1 and the original values of `A` and `B` are unchanged.
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, and the first two elements of each operation tuple in `operations` have been printed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers between 2 and 50, and `A`, a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each integer is either 0 or 1. It checks for the presence of 2x2 submatrices in `A` with all elements equal to 1 and marks the corresponding positions in a new 2D list `B`. If `A` and `B` are not identical, it returns -1, indicating that the transformation is not possible. If `A` and `B` are identical, it prints the number of operations (2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1) and their positions. The function does not modify the original list `A` and only returns -1 or prints the results without returning a value, effectively having a side effect through printing. The function handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are at their minimum (2) and maximum (50) values, but it assumes that the input 2D list `A` is correctly formatted with the specified dimensions and element values (0 or 1). If the annotations and actual code logic diverge, the code's behavior takes precedence, indicating that the function prioritizes detecting 2x2 submatrices and checking list equality over handling incorrect input formats.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
