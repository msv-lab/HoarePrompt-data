You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$

                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1

                return -1

Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given Python program is attempting to solve the matrix transformation problem by identifying 2x2 submatrices in matrix A that contain all 1s and then performing the corresponding operation on matrix B. However, this approach is incomplete and does not cover all possible cases.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when matrix A has a single 1 in a row or column, and the rest of the elements are 0s. In such a case, the program will not be able to transform matrix B into matrix A because it only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all 1s.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

The program will not be able to transform matrix B into matrix A because it only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all 1s, and none exist in this case. However, it is possible to transform matrix B into matrix A by setting the top-left element of matrix B to 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle cases where a single 1 appears in a row or column of matrix A. This can be done by adding additional checks and operations to the program. 

The program also needs a more sophisticated approach to handle cases where matrix A contains 1s in a way that cannot be transformed into matrix B by the given operations. For instance, if matrix A contains two 1s that are not in the same 2x2 submatrix, the program should output -1. 

One possible approach is to implement a more sophisticated algorithm, such as a backtracking or dynamic programming algorithm, to determine the sequence of operations needed to transform matrix B into matrix A. 

However, without these modifications, the given program is incomplete and does not cover all possible cases, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n <= 50 and 2 <= m <= 50, and A is a 2D list of integers with n rows and m columns where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 for each 2x2 submatrix in the original `A` starting at `(i, j)` with all elements equal to 1, and 0 otherwise, `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such submatrix.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, either `A` is equal to `B` and `i` is `n` and `j` is `m`, or the function has returned -1 and the original values of `A` and `B` are unchanged.
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, and the first two elements of each operation tuple in `operations` have been printed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers between 2 and 50, and `A`, a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each integer is either 0 or 1. It checks for the presence of 2x2 submatrices in `A` with all elements equal to 1 and marks the corresponding positions in a new 2D list `B`. If `A` and `B` are not identical, it returns -1, indicating that the transformation is not possible. If `A` and `B` are identical, it prints the number of operations (2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1) and their positions. The function does not modify the original list `A` and only returns -1 or prints the results without returning a value, effectively having a side effect through printing. The function handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are at their minimum (2) and maximum (50) values, but it assumes that the input 2D list `A` is correctly formatted with the specified dimensions and element values (0 or 1). If the annotations and actual code logic diverge, the code's behavior takes precedence, indicating that the function prioritizes detecting 2x2 submatrices and checking list equality over handling incorrect input formats.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
