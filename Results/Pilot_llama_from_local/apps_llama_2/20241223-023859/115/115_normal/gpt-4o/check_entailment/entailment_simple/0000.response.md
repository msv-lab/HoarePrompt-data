Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description says. 

The problem description requires that we find a sequence of operations that transforms matrix B into matrix A. However, the program only checks for 2x2 submatrices in matrix A where all elements are 1, and sets the corresponding elements in matrix B to 1. 

The program does not handle cases where a single element in matrix A is 1, but it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all elements equal to 1. In such cases, the program will not be able to set the corresponding element in matrix B to 1, because it only sets elements in 2x2 submatrices.

For example, consider the following matrix A:

```
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```

In this case, the program will not be able to set the top-left element of matrix B to 1, because it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all elements equal to 1. Therefore, the program will return -1, indicating that it is impossible to transform matrix B into matrix A, even though it is possible to do so by setting the top-left element of matrix B to 1 directly.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle cases where a single element in matrix A is 1, but it is not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all elements equal to 1. This can be done by adding additional logic to the program to check for such cases and set the corresponding elements in matrix B to 1 accordingly.
