The original assessment is that the program's correctness is **False**. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code.

The reason for this assessment is that the program does not correctly handle the cases where it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A. The program only checks for submatrices where all four elements are 1, but it does not consider the cases where there are isolated 1s in the matrix. In such cases, it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A, and the program should print -1.

The annotated version of the code does not provide a different perspective on the program's correctness. In fact, it supports the original assessment by highlighting the states of the program at different points, which shows that the program does not perform any checks for isolated 1s in the matrix.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is **False**, and it is because the program does not correctly handle the cases where it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A.

Final: **False**
