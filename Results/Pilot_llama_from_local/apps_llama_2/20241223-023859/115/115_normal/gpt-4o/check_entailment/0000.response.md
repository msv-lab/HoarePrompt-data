Correctness: **False**.

The given program is trying to solve the problem by checking all the submatrices of size 2x2 in the given matrix A. If it finds a submatrix where all elements are 1, it performs an operation to make the corresponding submatrix in B equal to the submatrix in A. 

However, the program is not correctly handling the cases where it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A. The problem statement requires that if it's not possible to make the matrices equal, the program should print -1. 

The issue with the current implementation is that it does not correctly handle the cases where the input matrix A has a 1 in a position where it's not possible to cover that 1 with a 2x2 submatrix. For example, if the input matrix A is:

```
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

The program does not correctly identify that it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A and instead returns a wrong result. 

The program only checks for submatrices where all four elements are 1, but it does not consider the cases where there are isolated 1s in the matrix. In such cases, it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A, and the program should print -1. 

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to check for isolated 1s in the matrix and return -1 if it finds any. 

Here's a possible modification:

```python
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    possible = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] == 1:
                has_neighbor = False
                for x, y in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
                    if 0 <= i + x < n and 0 <= j + y < m and A[i + x][j + y] == 1:
                        has_neighbor = True
                        break
                if not has_neighbor:
                    possible = False
                    break
        if not possible:
            break
    if not possible:
        return -1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and (A[i + 1][j] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
```

This modification checks for isolated 1s in the matrix and returns -1 if it finds any. It also correctly handles the cases where it's not possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A.
