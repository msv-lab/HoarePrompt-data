Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description asks for in every potential case. The problem description requires that the program should find a sequence of operations that makes matrix B equal to matrix A, if it's possible. However, the provided program only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1 in matrix A and marks the corresponding positions in matrix B. 

It does not handle the case when a single cell in matrix A is 1 and it's not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all elements equal to 1. In such cases, the program will return -1, indicating that the transformation is not possible. However, according to the problem description, it's possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A by choosing a 2x2 submatrix that includes the cell with the value 1 and setting all its elements to 1.

For example, if matrix A is:
```
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 0
```
The program will return -1, but it's possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A by choosing the 2x2 submatrix that includes the cell with the value 1 and setting all its elements to 1. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and its correctness is **False**.
