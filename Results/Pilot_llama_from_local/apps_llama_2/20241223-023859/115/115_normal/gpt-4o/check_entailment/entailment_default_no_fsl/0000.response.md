Correctness: **False**

The given code only checks for 2x2 submatrices in the matrix A where all elements are 1 and performs the operation accordingly. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases where the transformation is possible. For example, if the matrix A has a single 1 in a position that is not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all 1s, the code will return -1, indicating that the transformation is not possible, even though it might be possible by performing operations that cover the single 1.

A counterexample is a 3x3 matrix with A having the following values:
```
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
```
The code will return -1, but it's actually possible to transform the matrix B into A by performing operations that cover the individual 1s.

To fix this issue, the code needs to be modified to check for individual 1s and perform operations accordingly, not just relying on the presence of 2x2 submatrices with all 1s. The code should consider all possible combinations of operations that could transform matrix B into matrix A.
