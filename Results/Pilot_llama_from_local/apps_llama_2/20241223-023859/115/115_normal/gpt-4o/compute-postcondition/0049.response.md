To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`, which means the loop will execute `m` times, with `j` taking values from 0 to `m-1`.

Given states:
- `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 for each 2x2 submatrix in the original `A` starting at `(i, j)` with all elements equal to 1, and 0 otherwise
- `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such submatrix
- `i` is 0

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `m` must be greater than 0, which is already given as 2 <= `m` <= 50.
- `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 for each 2x2 submatrix in the original `A` starting at `(i, j)` with all elements equal to 1, and 0 otherwise
- `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such submatrix
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
