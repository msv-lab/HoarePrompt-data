The given code snippet prints the first two elements of an operation tuple. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` do not change, so they are still as follows: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples with at least 1 operation. Additionally, the first two elements of an operation tuple `op` have been printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples with at least 1 operation, and the first two elements of an operation tuple `op` have been printed as `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
