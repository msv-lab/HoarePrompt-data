Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 3 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `A[0][2]`, `A[0][3]`, `A[1][2]`, and `A[1][3]` are all 1, then `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 3)`. Otherwise, `operations` is not modified.***
