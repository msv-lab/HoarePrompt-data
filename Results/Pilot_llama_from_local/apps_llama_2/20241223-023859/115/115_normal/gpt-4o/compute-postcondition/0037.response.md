Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[2][0]`, `B[2][1]`, `B[3][0]`, and `B[3][1]` are all 1 and `operations` includes `(3, 1)`. Otherwise, the state of `A`, `B`, and `operations` remains unchanged.***
