According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50 and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` equals 1 if the corresponding 2x2 submatrix in the original `A` starting at `(i, j)` has all elements equal to 1, `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met in the original `A`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m - 2`**
