Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` > 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
