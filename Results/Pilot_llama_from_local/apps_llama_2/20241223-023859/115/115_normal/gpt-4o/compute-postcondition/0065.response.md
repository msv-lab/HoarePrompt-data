According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The loop will execute again if `m` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` must be greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the element at row `i` and column `j` of `A` is equal to the element at row `i` and column `j` of `B`.**
