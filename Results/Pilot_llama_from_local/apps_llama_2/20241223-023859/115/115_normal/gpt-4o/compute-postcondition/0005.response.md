The given code updates the values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

The initial state is: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. 

The current values of `i` and `j` are such that `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` = `B[i][j + 1]` = `B[i + 1][j]` = `B[i + 1][j + 1]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1**
