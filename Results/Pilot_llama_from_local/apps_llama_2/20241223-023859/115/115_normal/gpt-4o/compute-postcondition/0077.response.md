According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, all elements at row `i-1` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1, `m` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`**
