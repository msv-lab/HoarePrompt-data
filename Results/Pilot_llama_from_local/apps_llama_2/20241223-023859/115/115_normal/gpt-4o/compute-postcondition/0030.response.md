Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` is at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[1][2]`, `B[1][3]`, `B[2][2]`, and `B[2][3]` are 1 and `operations` includes `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)` and possibly other values based on `A`. Otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
