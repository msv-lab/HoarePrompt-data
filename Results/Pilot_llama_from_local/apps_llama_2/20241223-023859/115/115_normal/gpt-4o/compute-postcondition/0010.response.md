The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The tuple is created by incrementing `i` by 1 and `j` by 1. 

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 1 and `j + 1` equals 2. 

So, the new tuple `(1, 2)` is appended to the `operations` list. Initially, `operations` contained the tuple `(1, 1)`. 

After the operation, `operations` will contain two tuples: `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]` = `B[0][2]` = `B[1][1]` = `B[1][2]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]` = `B[0][2]` = `B[1][1]` = `B[1][2]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
