The code `operations = []` initializes an empty list called `operations`. This list is intended to store operations, but no operations have been added to it yet.

The initial state has `n` and `m` as integers with specific ranges, and `A` as a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each integer in `A` is either 0 or 1. The creation of the `operations` list does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, and `operations` is an empty list.**
