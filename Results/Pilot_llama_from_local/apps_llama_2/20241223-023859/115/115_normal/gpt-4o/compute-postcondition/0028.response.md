To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer and `m` must be at least 3 and greater than `j` + 1, where `j` is 2, so `m` >= 3
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- If `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, `B[2][1]`, and `B[2][2]` are 1
- `operations` includes `(2, 2)` and if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `operations` includes `(1, j)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met and also `(2, 1)`
- `i` is 1, `j` is 2

Given the code:
```python
B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
```

This code sets the values of `B` at positions `(i, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)` to 1. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, it specifically sets `B[1][2]`, `B[1][3]`, `B[2][2]`, and `B[2][3]` to 1.

The output state will reflect the changes made to `B` while keeping all other conditions the same. Thus, the updated output state considering the initial conditions and the change is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` is at least 3 and greater than or equal to 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][2]`, `B[1][3]`, `B[2][2]`, and `B[2][3]` are 1, and other positions in `B` are as previously defined based on `A`, `operations` includes `(2, 2)` and possibly other values based on `A`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
