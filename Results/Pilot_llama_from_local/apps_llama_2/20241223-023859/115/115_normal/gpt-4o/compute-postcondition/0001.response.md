The code creates a new 2D list `B` with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is initialized to 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list, and `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is 0.**
