Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `A[2][1]` is 1 and `A[2][2]` is 1 and `A[3][1]` is 1 and `A[3][2]` is 1, then `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][1]`, `B[2][2]`, `B[3][1]`, and `B[3][2]` are 1, and `operations` is a list of tuples that includes the tuple (3, 2). Otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.***
