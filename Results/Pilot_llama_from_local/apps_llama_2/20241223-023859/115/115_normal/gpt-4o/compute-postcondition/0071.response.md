To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the output states provided for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
        return -1
```
This loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D lists `A` and `B`, starting from column 0 and ending at column `m-1`. For each column, it checks if the element at row `i` and column `j` in `A` is equal to the corresponding element in `B`. If it finds a pair of elements that are not equal, the program immediately returns -1.

From the output states provided, we can see that:

* After 1 iteration, `j` is 0, and the elements at row `i` and column 0 in `A` and `B` are equal.
* After 2 iterations, `j` is 1, and the elements at row `i` and column 1 in `A` and `B` are equal, assuming the program has not returned -1.
* After 3 iterations, `j` is 2, and the elements at row `i` and column 2 in `A` and `B` are equal, assuming the program has not returned -1.

Now, let's think about what happens after all iterations have finished. The loop will have checked all columns from 0 to `m-1`. If the program has not returned -1, it means that all elements at row `i` in `A` and `B` are equal.

However, if at any point during the loop, the program finds a pair of elements that are not equal, it will return -1 immediately. In this case, the loop will not finish, and the program will terminate.

So, the output state after all iterations have finished can be summarized as follows:

* If the program has not returned -1, it means that all elements at row `i` in `A` and `B` are equal.
* The value of `j` will be `m-1`, since the loop iterates over all columns from 0 to `m-1`.
* The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `operations`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, and all elements at row `i` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1.**
