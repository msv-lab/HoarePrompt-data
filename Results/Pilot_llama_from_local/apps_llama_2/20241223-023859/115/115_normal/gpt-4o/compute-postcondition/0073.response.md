According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m-1`, which means the loop will execute from the first column to the last column. So, for the loop to execute, `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop. 
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, all elements at row `i-1` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1, and `m` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
