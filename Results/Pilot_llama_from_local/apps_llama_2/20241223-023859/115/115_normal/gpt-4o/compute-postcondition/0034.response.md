Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` equals 1 if the corresponding 2x2 submatrix in the original `A` starting at `(i, j)` has all elements equal to 1, `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met in the original `A`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][0]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1**
