Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` equals 1 if the corresponding 2x2 submatrix in `A` starting at `(i, j)` has all elements equal to 1 (for `i = 0` and `j` from 0 to `m - 2`), and 0 otherwise, `operations` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met, `i` is 1, the current value of `j` is 0, and the current state of `A` at position `(i, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)` is such that `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1.**
