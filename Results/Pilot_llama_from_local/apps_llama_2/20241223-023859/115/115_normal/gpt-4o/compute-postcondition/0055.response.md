Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
