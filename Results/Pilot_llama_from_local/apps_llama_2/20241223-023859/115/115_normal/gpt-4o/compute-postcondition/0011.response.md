Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, if `A[0][1]` equals 1, `A[0][2]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, and `A[1][2]` equals 1, then `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]` = `B[0][2]` = `B[1][1]` = `B[1][2]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, and `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, otherwise the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.**
