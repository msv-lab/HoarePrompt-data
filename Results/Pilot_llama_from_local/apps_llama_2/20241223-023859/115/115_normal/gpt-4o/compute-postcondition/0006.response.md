The given code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. 

Therefore, `operations` will now contain the tuple `(0 + 1, 0 + 1)` which is `(1, 1)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` = `B[i][j + 1]` = `B[i + 1][j]` = `B[i + 1][j + 1]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1**
