The given code snippet prints the first two elements of each operation in the `operations` list. 

The value of `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, 
the value of `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, 
`A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, 
`B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, 
`operations` is a list of tuples with at least 2 operations.

The states of the variables `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` are not affected by the code snippet. 

The code only prints the values of `op[0]` and `op[1]` for each operation `op` in `operations`. 

The output will include the first two elements of each operation in the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples with at least 2 operations, and the first two elements of each operation have been printed**
