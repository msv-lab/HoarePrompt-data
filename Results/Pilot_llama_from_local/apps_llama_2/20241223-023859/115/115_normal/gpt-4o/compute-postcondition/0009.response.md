The value of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are updated to 1. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` are updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][1]` = `B[0][2]` = `B[1][1]` = `B[1][2]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
