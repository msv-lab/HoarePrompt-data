Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` > 0, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, all elements at row `i-1` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1. The current values of `A` at position `[i][j]` and `B` at position `[i][j]` are not equal, meaning `A[i][j]`!= `B[i][j]`.**
