The code updates the values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the updated values are `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, `B[2][1]`, and `B[2][2]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The conditions for `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, `i`, and `j` remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, `B[2][1]`, and `B[2][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `operations` includes `(1, j)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met and also `(2, 1)`**
