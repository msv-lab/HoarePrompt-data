The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The value of `i` is 1 and the value of `j` is 1. 

After executing the code, `operations` includes the new tuple `(2, 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The condition for `operations` to include `(1, j)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met and also `(2, 1)` still holds, but now `operations` also includes `(2, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, `B[2][1]`, and `B[2][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples including `(2, 2)` and if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `operations` includes `(1, j)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met and also `(2, 1)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
