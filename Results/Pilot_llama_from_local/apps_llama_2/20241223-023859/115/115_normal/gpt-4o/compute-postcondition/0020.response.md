The given code `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` updates the values of `B` at positions `(i, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)` to 1. 

The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and the value of `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive). 

The 2D list `A` still has `n` rows and `m` columns with each integer being either 0 or 1, and its current state at position `(i, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)` is such that `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1.

The value of `i` is 1, and the value of `j` is 0.

The list `operations` is not affected by the given code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` equals 1, `B[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `B[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list of tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0**
