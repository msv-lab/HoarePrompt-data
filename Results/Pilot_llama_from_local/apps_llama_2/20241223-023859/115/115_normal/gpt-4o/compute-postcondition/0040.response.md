The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The new tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. So, `i + 1` equals 3 and `j + 1` equals 2.

The states of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code. 

The value of `operations` is updated by appending the tuple `(3, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][1]`, `B[2][2]`, `B[3][1]`, and `B[3][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples and includes the tuple (3, 2), `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
