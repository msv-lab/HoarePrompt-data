To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
        return -1
```
This loop iterates over each column `j` in the range of `m`. For each column, it checks if the element at position `(i, j)` in matrix `A` is equal to the element at the same position in matrix `B`. If it finds any pair of elements that are not equal, the function immediately returns `-1`.

Given this behavior, let's consider the possible outcomes:

1. **The loop completes without finding any unequal elements**: In this case, the loop will iterate over all columns `j` in the range of `m` without returning `-1`. This means that for the current row `i`, all elements in `A` are equal to their corresponding elements in `B`.

2. **The loop finds an unequal pair of elements**: As soon as the loop encounters a pair of elements where `A[i][j]!= B[i][j]`, it will return `-1` without continuing to the next iterations.

Given these outcomes, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

- If the function has not returned `-1`, it means that for the current row `i`, all elements in `A` are equal to their corresponding elements in `B`. The variables `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` retain their original values since the loop does not modify them. The variable `i` remains `0` because the loop only iterates over the columns for the first row (since `i` is not updated within the loop). The variable `j` will be `m` after the loop completes because the loop iterates over all columns.

- If the function returns `-1`, it indicates that there was at least one position `(i, j)` where `A[i][j]!= B[i][j]`. In this case, the loop does not complete, and the state of the variables at the point of return would be `i` is `0`, and `j` is the column index where the inequality was found.

Considering the provided constraints and the behavior of the loop, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, and either `j` is `m` if the loop completes without finding any unequal elements, or the function returns -1 and the loop does not complete, indicating that there is at least one pair of unequal elements between `A` and `B` for the row `i`.**
