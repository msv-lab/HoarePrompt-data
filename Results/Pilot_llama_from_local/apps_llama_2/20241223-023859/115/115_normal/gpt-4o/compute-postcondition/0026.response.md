Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, if `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, `B[2][1]`, and `B[2][2]` are 1, and `operations` includes `(2, 2)` and if `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, then `operations` includes `(1, j)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met and also `(2, 1)`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, otherwise the state remains unchanged**
