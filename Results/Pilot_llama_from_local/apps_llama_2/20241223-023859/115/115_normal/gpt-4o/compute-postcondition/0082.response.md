Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `m` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, the program continues execution with all elements at row `i-1` in `A` and `B` being equal.**
