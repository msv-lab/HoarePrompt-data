According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` list. If the list has at least 2 operations, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `operations` has at least 1 operation, and the first two elements of an operation tuple `op` have been printed as `op[0]` and `op[1]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 operations.
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples with at least 2 operations**
