Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.**
