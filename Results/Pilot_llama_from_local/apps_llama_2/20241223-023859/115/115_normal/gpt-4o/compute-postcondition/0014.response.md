The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. 

Given the initial state: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 3 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[0][2]`, `A[0][3]`, `A[1][2]`, and `A[1][3]` are 1 and other elements are either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2.

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, then `i + 1` equals 1 and `j + 1` equals 3. 

So, `(i + 1, j + 1)` equals `(1, 3)`.

The state of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 3 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[0][2]`, `A[0][3]`, `A[1][2]`, and `A[1][3]` are 1 and other elements are either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 3 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[0][2]`, `A[0][3]`, `A[1][2]`, and `A[1][3]` are 1 and other elements are either 0 or 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 3)`**
