The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, so the new tuple is `(1 + 1, 0 + 1)` which equals `(2, 1)`.

The states of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B` are not affected, and `i` and `j` are also not changed by this code, they are still 1 and 0 respectively.

The `operations` list initially contains tuples `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met, and now it also includes the tuple `(2, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `A[1][0]` equals 1, `A[1][1]` equals 1, `A[2][0]` equals 1, and `A[2][1]` equals 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][0]` equals 1, `B[1][1]` equals 1, `B[2][0]` equals 1, and `B[2][1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list of tuples including `(1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met and also `(2, 1)`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0**
