According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 
So, the new state of `j` is 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, `B`, and `i` remain unchanged.
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1. If `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]` = `B[i][j + 1]` = `B[i + 1][j]` = `B[i + 1][j + 1]` = 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
