To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
        return -1
```
This loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D lists `A` and `B`, and checks if the elements at row `i` and column `j` are equal. If they are not equal, the program immediately returns -1.

From the output states for the first few iterations, we can see that:

* After the loop executes 1 time, `j` is 0, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.
* After the loop executes 2 times, `j` is 1, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.
* After the loop executes 3 times, `j` is 2, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.

We can see a pattern emerging: after each iteration, `j` increments by 1, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1.

Now, let's think about what happens after all iterations of the loop have finished. The loop will iterate `m` times, where `m` is the number of columns in the 2D lists `A` and `B`.

If the loop completes all iterations without returning -1, it means that `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` in range `m`. In other words, all elements at row `i` in `A` and `B` are equal.

If the loop returns -1 at any point, it means that `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]` for some `j`. In this case, the program will terminate immediately, and the output state will be that the program has returned -1.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, either all elements at row `i` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` is `m`.**
