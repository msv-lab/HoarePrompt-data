Based on the provided loop code and the output states after a few iterations, we can analyze the loop's behavior and determine its output state after all iterations have finished.

The loop code compares each element of the 2D lists `A` and `B` and returns -1 if it finds any unequal elements. If the loop completes without finding any unequal elements, it means that all elements in `A` and `B` are equal.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

* If the loop executes at least once, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `A` and `B` are 2D lists with `n` rows and `m` columns.
* If the loop completes without finding any unequal elements, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will be equal to `m`.
* If the loop finds any unequal elements, it will return -1, and the loop will not complete.

Considering these patterns and the loop code, we can determine the output state after all iterations have finished:

* If the loop completes without finding any unequal elements, `A` and `B` will be equal, and `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will be equal to `m`.
* If the loop finds any unequal elements, it will return -1, and the loop will not complete. In this case, the original values of `A` and `B` will remain unchanged.
* The value of `operations` is not affected by the loop, so it will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, either `A` is equal to `B` and `i` is `n` and `j` is `m`, or the function has returned -1 and the original values of `A` and `B` are unchanged.**
