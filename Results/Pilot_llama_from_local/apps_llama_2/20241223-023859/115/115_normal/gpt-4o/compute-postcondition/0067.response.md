Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` must be greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If the element at row `i` and column `j` of `A` is not equal to the element at row `i` and column `j` of `B`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made and the program state remains unchanged.***
