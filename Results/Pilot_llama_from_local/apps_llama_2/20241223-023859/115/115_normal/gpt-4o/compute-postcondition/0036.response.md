The given code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, the tuple `(2 + 1, 0 + 1)` which is `(3, 1)` will be appended to the `operations` list.

The states of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and the current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][0]`, and `A[3][1]` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][0]`, `B[2][1]`, `B[3][0]`, and `B[3][1]` are all 1, `operations` is a list of tuples including `(3, 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][0]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1**
