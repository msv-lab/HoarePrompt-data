According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, and all elements at row `i` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, thus `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. Other variables `m`, `A`, `B`, `operations`, and `j` remain unchanged as their values are not dependent on the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is `m-1`, and all elements at row `i-1` in `A` and `B` are equal, or the program has returned -1, and `n` must be greater than 1**
