The values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are updated to 1. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, `B[2][1]`, `B[2][2]`, `B[3][1]`, and `B[3][2]` are set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][1]`, `B[2][2]`, `B[3][1]`, and `B[3][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][1]`, `B[2][2]`, `B[3][1]`, and `B[3][2]` are 1, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
