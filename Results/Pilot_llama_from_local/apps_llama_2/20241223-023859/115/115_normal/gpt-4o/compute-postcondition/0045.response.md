Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` > 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `A[2][2] = A[2][3] = A[3][2] = A[3][3] = 1`, then `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 3)`. Otherwise, there are no additional changes to the variables.***
