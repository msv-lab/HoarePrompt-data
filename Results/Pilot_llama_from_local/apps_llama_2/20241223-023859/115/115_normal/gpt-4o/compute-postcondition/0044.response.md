The code snippet `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing the incremented values of `i` and `j` to the `operations` list. 

Given the initial state: `n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` > 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, and specifically `A[2][2] = A[2][3] = A[3][2] = A[3][3] = 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2.

We have `i + 1 = 3` and `j + 1 = 3`. So, `(i + 1, j + 1) = (3, 3)` will be appended to the `operations` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` > 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, and specifically `A[2][2] = A[2][3] = A[3][2] = A[3][3] = 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` > 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, and specifically `A[2][2] = A[2][3] = A[3][2] = A[3][3] = 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(3, 3)`**
