The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50. `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, the function returns -1 in various cases, including when the elements at specific positions in 2D lists `A` and another list (assumed to be `B` based on the context) are not equal under certain conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and a 2D list A with n rows and m columns containing integers 0 or 1, and returns -1 under various conditions related to the equality of elements in A and another 2D list, particularly focusing on the comparison at specific row and column indices.**
