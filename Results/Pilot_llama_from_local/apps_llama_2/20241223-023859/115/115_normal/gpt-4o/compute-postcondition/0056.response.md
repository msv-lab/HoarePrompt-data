To determine the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The given for loop statement is:
```
for j in range(m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
- `n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes occur.

Since the loop iterates over the range of `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` must be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute again, `j` should be less than `m-1` because the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m`. 

If `j` is equal to `m-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop has finished executing for all values of `j` from 0 to `m-1`, so there is no next iteration.

Given that `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time, for the loop to execute one more time after the previous iteration, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.

State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `j` must be less than `m-1` if we are considering the state right before the last iteration**
