The code appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The new tuple is `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the new tuple is `(1 + 1, 2 + 1)` which equals `(2, 3)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is still an integer and `m` is at least 3, `A` is still a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is still a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][2]`, `B[1][3]`, `B[2][2]`, and `B[2][3]` are 1, `i` is still 1, and `j` is still 2.

The `operations` list now includes `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)` and possibly other values based on `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` is at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[1][2]`, `B[1][3]`, `B[2][2]`, and `B[2][3]` are 1, `operations` includes `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)` and possibly other values based on `A`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
