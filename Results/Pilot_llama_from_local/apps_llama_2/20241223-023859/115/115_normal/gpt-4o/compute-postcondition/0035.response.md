The given code updates the values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` to 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. 

`B[2][0]`, `B[2][1]`, `B[3][0]`, and `B[3][1]` are all updated to 1.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `A`, `operations`, `i`, and `j` retain their original values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][0]`, `B[2][1]`, `B[3][0]`, and `B[3][1]` are all 1, `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met in the original `A`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][0]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[2][0]`, `B[2][1]`, `B[3][0]`, and `B[3][1]` are all 1, `operations` is a list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each `j` where the 2x2 submatrix condition is met in the original `A`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, the current values of `A[2][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][0]`, and `A[3][1]` are all 1**
