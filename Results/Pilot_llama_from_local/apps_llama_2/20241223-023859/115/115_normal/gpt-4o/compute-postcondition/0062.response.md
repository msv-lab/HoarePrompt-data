Postcondition: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. The current value of `A` at position `[i][j]` is not equal to the current value of `B` at position `[i][j]`.**
