According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again for `j` equals to 2.
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and `m` must be greater than 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
