The code `print(len(operations))` prints the length of the `operations` list. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, or `operations`. It only outputs the number of elements in the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, the length of `operations` has been printed, and either `A` is equal to `B` and `i` is `n` and `j` is `m`, or the function has returned -1 and the original values of `A` and `B` are unchanged.**
