According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is at least 2 and at most 50. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer and 2 < `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each integer is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of tuples, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
