The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers between 2 and 50, and `A`, a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each integer is either 0 or 1. It checks for the presence of 2x2 submatrices in `A` with all elements equal to 1 and marks the corresponding positions in a new 2D list `B`. If `A` and `B` are not identical, it returns -1, indicating that the transformation is not possible. If `A` and `B` are identical, it prints the number of operations (2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1) and their positions. The function does not modify the original list `A` and only returns -1 or prints the results without returning a value, effectively having a side effect through printing. The function handles edge cases where `n` and `m` are at their minimum (2) and maximum (50) values, but it assumes that the input 2D list `A` is correctly formatted with the specified dimensions and element values (0 or 1). If the annotations and actual code logic diverge, the code's behavior takes precedence, indicating that the function prioritizes detecting 2x2 submatrices and checking list equality over handling incorrect input formats.
