Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, and 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`. The current values of `l` and `r` are 1 and `n` respectively, meaning the entire tab segment is selected from the first tab to the last tab.**
