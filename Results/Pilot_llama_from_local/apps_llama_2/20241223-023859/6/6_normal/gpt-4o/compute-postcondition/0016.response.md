Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open. If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, the value 0 has been printed. If `l` is 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned as output. If `l` is not 1, then if `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed; otherwise, the value of `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))` is returned, maintaining the constraints that `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`.**
