The variable `move_to_l` is assigned the absolute difference between the initial mouse cursor position `pos` and the start index of the tab segment `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment, where 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, and 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, and considering the constraints that `l` is not 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the output state will include these conditions. 

`move_to_l` equals the absolute value of `pos - l`, `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open.

Output State: **`n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, where 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, and 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not 1, `r` is less than `n`, and `move_to_l` equals the absolute value of `pos - l`.**
