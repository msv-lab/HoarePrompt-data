The code calculates the absolute difference between the current mouse cursor position `pos` and the end index `r` of the tab segment, and assigns this value to `move_to_r`. 

The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, and `move_to_l` are not changed by this code. 

The conditions on the variables, such as `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not 1, and `r` is less than `n`, are still valid. 

`move_to_l` remains equal to the absolute value of `pos - l`, as it was before.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not 1, `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` equals the absolute value of `pos - l`, and `move_to_r` equals the absolute value of `pos - r`.

Output State: **`n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not 1, `r` is less than `n`, `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, and `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`**
