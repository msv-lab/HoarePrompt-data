The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. `n` represents the total number of tabs and is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, also a non-negative integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive). `l` and `r` represent the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, where both are non-negative integers, `l` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `r` is between `l` and `n` (inclusive). 

However, since the provided information does not specify the return value or behavior of the function based on these inputs, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function beyond what it accepts as parameters.

Given the lack of specific output or return value information in the problem statement, we can only describe the input parameters' constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` with the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, where n is the total number of tabs, pos is the initial mouse cursor position, and l and r are the start and end indices of the tab segment, with the constraints that n, pos, l, and r are non-negative integers, 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, and 1 <= l <= r <= n.**
