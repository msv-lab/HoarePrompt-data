The given code updates the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` using the `map` function to convert input values to integers. The `input().split()` expression splits the input string into a list of strings separated by whitespace, and `map(int,...)` converts each string to an integer.

The output state is that `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are assigned the input integer values, such that `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, and 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`.**
