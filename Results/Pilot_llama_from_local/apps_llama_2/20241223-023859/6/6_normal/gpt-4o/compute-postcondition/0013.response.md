The code `print(close_both_sides)` prints the value of `close_both_sides`, which is equal to `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

The value of `close_both_sides` is returned at the output.

Output State: **`n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, the value of `close_both_sides` is returned, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not 1, `r` is less than `n`**
