Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open. If `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed. Otherwise, the value of `close_both_sides`, which is `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, is returned, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, and `l` is not 1.**
