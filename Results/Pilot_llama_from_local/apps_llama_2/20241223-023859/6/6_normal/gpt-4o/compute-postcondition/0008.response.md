The code prints the absolute difference between the current mouse cursor position `pos` and the start index of the tab segment `l`, plus 1. 

`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open. 

Given that `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is equal to `n`, the print statement will output the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, plus 1.

The values of the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are not changed by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` is the start index of the tab segment, `r` is equal to `n`, and the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` is the start index of the tab segment, `r` is equal to `n`, and the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed.**
