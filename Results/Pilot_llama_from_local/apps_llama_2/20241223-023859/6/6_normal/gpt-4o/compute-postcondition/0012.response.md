The code calculates `close_both_sides` as the minimum between `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`. 

Given that `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)` and `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, we can substitute these values into the equation for `close_both_sides`. 

So, `close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, and `close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not 1, `r` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not 1, `r` is less than `n`**
