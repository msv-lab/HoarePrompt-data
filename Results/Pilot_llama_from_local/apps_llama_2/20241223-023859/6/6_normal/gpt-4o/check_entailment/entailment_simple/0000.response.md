Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is a correct implementation of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the segment to be left open is the entire range of tabs (`l == 1 and r == n`). If this is the case, it correctly prints `0` as no operations are needed.

2. If the segment to be left open starts at the first tab (`l == 1`), the program calculates the minimum number of operations as the absolute difference between the cursor position and the end of the segment (`abs(pos - r)`) plus one (to close all tabs to the right of the cursor). This is correct according to the problem description.

3. If the segment to be left open ends at the last tab (`r == n`), the program calculates the minimum number of operations as the absolute difference between the cursor position and the start of the segment (`abs(pos - l)`) plus one (to close all tabs to the left of the cursor). This is also correct according to the problem description.

4. If the segment to be left open is in the middle of the tabs (`l > 1 and r < n`), the program calculates the minimum number of operations by considering two options:
   - Moving the cursor to the start of the segment (`abs(pos - l)`) and then closing all tabs to the left and right of the segment, which takes `r - l + 2` operations.
   - Moving the cursor to the end of the segment (`abs(pos - r)`) and then closing all tabs to the left and right of the segment, which also takes `r - l + 2` operations.
   The program correctly takes the minimum of these two options.

In all cases, the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to leave only the tabs within the specified segment open. Therefore, the program is correct.
