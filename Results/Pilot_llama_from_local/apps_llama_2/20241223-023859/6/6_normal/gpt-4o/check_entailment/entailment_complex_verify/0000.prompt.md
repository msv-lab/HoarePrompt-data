You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
        print(close_both_sides)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach. The issue arises when it attempts to calculate the minimum number of seconds required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. 

In the provided code, the `close_both_sides` variable is calculated as `min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))`, which does not accurately represent the optimal strategy.

For instance, consider the input `6 3 2 4`. The optimal strategy here is to move the cursor to tab 2, close all tabs to the left, move the cursor to tab 4, and then close all tabs to the right. However, the provided code does not account for this strategy correctly.

A correct approach would involve considering the minimum number of steps required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r], taking into account the optimal strategy of moving the cursor to one end of the segment and then closing all tabs to the left or right.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 

Input: `10 5 3 7`

Expected Output: `6` (move to tab 3, close all tabs to the left, move to tab 7, and close all tabs to the right)

Actual Output: `4` (due to incorrect calculation of `close_both_sides`)

To fix this issue, the code needs to be revised to accurately calculate the minimum number of steps required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r], considering the optimal strategy for each scenario.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four non-negative integer input values: n, pos, l, and r, where n is the total number of tabs, pos is the initial mouse cursor position, and l and r are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open, such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, and 1 <= l <= r <= n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    if (l == 1 and r == n) :
        print(0)
    else :
        if (l == 1) :
            print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
        else :
            if (r == n) :
                print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
            else :
                move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
                move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
                close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2))
                print(close_both_sides)
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open. If `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed. Otherwise, the value of `close_both_sides`, which is `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, is returned, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`, and `l` is not 1.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open. If `l` is 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned as output. If `l` is not 1, then if `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed; otherwise, the value of `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))` is returned, maintaining the constraints that `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are input integers, where `n` is the total number of tabs, `pos` is the initial mouse cursor position, and `l` and `r` are the start and end indices of the tab segment that needs to be left open. If `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`, the value 0 has been printed. If `l` is 1 and `r` is less than `n`, the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned as output. If `l` is not 1, then if `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed; otherwise, the value of `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))` is returned, maintaining the constraints that `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to close tabs outside the segment [l, r] in a tab strip of length n, given an initial mouse cursor position pos, where 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, and 1 <= l <= r <= n. The operations are: moving the cursor to a tab and closing it. The function handles four cases: 
- If l is 1 and r is n, it prints 0, as there are no tabs to close outside the segment.
- If l is 1 and r is less than n, it prints the absolute difference between pos and r plus 1, as the cursor needs to move to r and close the tabs to its right.
- If l is not 1 and r is n, it prints the absolute difference between pos and l plus 1, as the cursor needs to move to l and close the tabs to its left.
- If l is not 1 and r is not n, it prints the minimum of two values: 
  - The absolute difference between pos and l plus r-l+2, which represents moving to l, closing the tabs to its left, and then closing the tabs to the right of r.
  - The absolute difference between pos and r plus r-l+2, which represents moving to r, closing the tabs to its right, and then closing the tabs to the left of l.
