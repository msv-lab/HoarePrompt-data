Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly. 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Case 1: `l` is 1 and `r` is `n`**: In this case, the program prints 0, which is correct because there are no tabs to close outside the segment.

2. **Case 2: `l` is 1 and `r` is less than `n`**: The program prints `abs(pos - r) + 1`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the cursor to `r` and close the tabs to its right.

3. **Case 3: `l` is not 1 and `r` is `n`**: The program prints `abs(pos - l) + 1`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the cursor to `l` and close the tabs to its left.

4. **Case 4: `l` is not 1 and `r` is not `n`**: The program prints the minimum of two values:
   - `abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2)`, which represents moving to `l`, closing the tabs to its left, and then closing the tabs to the right of `r`.
   - `abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2)`, which represents moving to `r`, closing the tabs to its right, and then closing the tabs to the left of `l`.

In all cases, the program correctly calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to close the tabs outside the segment `[l, r]`, as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
