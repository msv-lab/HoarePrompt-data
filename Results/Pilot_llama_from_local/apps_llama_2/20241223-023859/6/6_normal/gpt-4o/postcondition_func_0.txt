The function calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to close tabs outside the segment [l, r] in a tab strip of length n, given an initial mouse cursor position pos, where 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, and 1 <= l <= r <= n. The operations are: moving the cursor to a tab and closing it. The function handles four cases: 
- If l is 1 and r is n, it prints 0, as there are no tabs to close outside the segment.
- If l is 1 and r is less than n, it prints the absolute difference between pos and r plus 1, as the cursor needs to move to r and close the tabs to its right.
- If l is not 1 and r is n, it prints the absolute difference between pos and l plus 1, as the cursor needs to move to l and close the tabs to its left.
- If l is not 1 and r is not n, it prints the minimum of two values: 
  - The absolute difference between pos and l plus r-l+2, which represents moving to l, closing the tabs to its left, and then closing the tabs to the right of r.
  - The absolute difference between pos and r plus r-l+2, which represents moving to r, closing the tabs to its right, and then closing the tabs to the left of l.
