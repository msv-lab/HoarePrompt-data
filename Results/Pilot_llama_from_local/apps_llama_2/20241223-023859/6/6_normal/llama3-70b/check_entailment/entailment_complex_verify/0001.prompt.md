You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the problem correctly for every potential case. One potential case where the program does not work as expected is when the cursor is within the segment [l, r] but not at the boundary. 

For example, consider the input: 
```
5 3 2 4
```
In this case, the cursor is at position 3, which is within the segment [2, 4]. However, the program will still calculate the distance from the cursor to the left boundary (l - pos = 2 - 3 = -1) and add it to the answer, which is incorrect. 

The correct approach would be to calculate the distance from the cursor to the nearest boundary of the segment [l, r] and add the number of tabs that need to be closed on the other side of the segment.

The given code seems to be attempting to calculate this, but it's doing so in a way that doesn't accurately reflect the problem description. The lines `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` seem to be trying to account for the tabs that need to be closed, but this approach is flawed because it doesn't take into account the position of the cursor relative to the segment [l, r]. 

To fix this, the program would need to be modified to correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r], taking into account the cursor's position and the number of tabs that need to be closed. 

For instance, if the cursor is at position `pos` and the segment is `[l, r]`, the program should calculate the minimum number of operations required to move the cursor to the nearest boundary of the segment (either `l` or `r`) and then close the tabs on the other side of the segment. 

Here's a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
        ans += n - r
    elif pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
        ans += l - 1
    else:
        ans += min(pos - l, r - pos) + max(n - r, l - 1)
    print(ans)

func()
```
This implementation correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r] based on the cursor's position and the number of tabs that need to be closed. 

Again, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, and therefore its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, pos, l, and r are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, 1 <= l <= r <= n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, with the constraints `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` that may or may not be satisfied. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos`. If `pos` is not less than `l`, then the state of `ans` is unchanged, remaining as 0.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, with the constraints `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` that may or may not be satisfied. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos`. If `pos` is not less than `l` and `pos` is less than or equal to `r`, then `ans` equals 0. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` equals `pos - r`.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as input, where `n` represents the total length of a sequence, `pos` represents a position within this sequence, and `l` and `r` define a range within the sequence. The function calculates and returns the minimum number of steps required to move `pos` into the range `[l, r]`. This calculation includes two components: the steps needed to move `pos` into the range `[l, r]` directly (either by moving `pos` to `l` if `pos` is less than `l`, or by moving `pos` to `r` if `pos` is greater than `r`), and the steps needed to adjust `pos` to account for the full range between `1` and `n`, considering the boundaries of `l` and `r` within this range. The function prints the total number of steps as its output. The function's calculations cover all potential edge cases, including when `pos` is within the range `[l, r]`, when `pos` is less than `l`, and when `pos` is greater than `r`, ensuring that the returned value accurately reflects the minimum steps required to align `pos` with the specified range within the sequence of length `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
