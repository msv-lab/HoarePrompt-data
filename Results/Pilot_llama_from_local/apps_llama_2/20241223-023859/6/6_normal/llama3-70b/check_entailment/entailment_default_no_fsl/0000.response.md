Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not accurately implement the logic described in the problem statement. The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to leave only the tabs with initial indices from `l` to `r` inclusive opened. The program's calculation does not fully capture the complexity of the problem, particularly in terms of closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor and moving the cursor to the appropriate position to minimize the number of operations.

One example where the program does not work as expected is when `n = 6`, `pos = 3`, `l = 2`, and `r = 4`. According to the problem description, one optimal sequence of operations is to shift the mouse cursor to tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, then move the cursor to tab 3, then to tab 4, and finally close all the tabs to the right of it, resulting in a total of 5 operations. However, the provided program does not accurately calculate the minimum number of operations required for this scenario.

Another issue with the program is that it does not properly consider the movement of the cursor and the closing of tabs in an integrated manner. The program simply calculates the distances and adds them together without considering the most efficient sequence of operations that Luba can perform.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, potentially involving a state-machine or dynamic programming to explore all possible sequences of operations and determine the minimum number required to achieve the desired state. The current program oversimplifies the problem and does not account for all possible scenarios and optimal sequences of actions.
