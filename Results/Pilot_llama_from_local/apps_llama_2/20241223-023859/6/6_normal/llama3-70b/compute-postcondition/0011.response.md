Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` as input, where `n` represents the total length of a sequence, `pos` represents a position within this sequence, and `l` and `r` define a range within the sequence. The function calculates and returns the minimum number of steps required to move `pos` into the range `[l, r]`. This calculation includes two components: the steps needed to move `pos` into the range `[l, r]` directly (either by moving `pos` to `l` if `pos` is less than `l`, or by moving `pos` to `r` if `pos` is greater than `r`), and the steps needed to adjust `pos` to account for the full range between `1` and `n`, considering the boundaries of `l` and `r` within this range. The function prints the total number of steps as its output. The function's calculations cover all potential edge cases, including when `pos` is within the range `[l, r]`, when `pos` is less than `l`, and when `pos` is greater than `r`, ensuring that the returned value accurately reflects the minimum steps required to align `pos` with the specified range within the sequence of length `n`.**
