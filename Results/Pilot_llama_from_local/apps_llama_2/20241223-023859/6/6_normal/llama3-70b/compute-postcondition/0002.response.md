Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, where these integers are provided as input by the user, and `ans` equals 0, with potential constraints of `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` that may or may not be satisfied. The current value of `pos` is less than the current value of `l`.**
