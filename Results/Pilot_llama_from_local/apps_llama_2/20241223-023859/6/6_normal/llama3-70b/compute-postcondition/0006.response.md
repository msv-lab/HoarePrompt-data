The value of `ans` is updated by adding `pos - r` to it. The initial value of `ans` depends on whether `pos` is less than `l` or not. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` initially equals `l - pos`. If `pos` is not less than `l`, then `ans` initially equals 0. However, we are given that the current value of `pos` is greater than `r`. 

Since `1 <= l <= r <= n` and `pos > r`, it is guaranteed that `pos` is not less than `l`. Therefore, `ans` initially equals 0. 

After the update, `ans` equals `0 + pos - r`, which simplifies to `pos - r`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer and is greater than `r`, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, with the constraints `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` that may or may not be satisfied, and `ans` equals `pos - r`.
Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer and is greater than `r`, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, with the constraints `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` that may or may not be satisfied, and `ans` equals `pos - r`.**
