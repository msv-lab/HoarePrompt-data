To calculate the new value of `ans`, we need to consider its current value based on the given conditions and then apply the changes as per the provided code snippet.

Given that:
- `n` equals the first input integer
- `pos` equals the second input integer
- `l` equals the third input integer
- `r` equals the fourth input integer
- The constraints `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` may or may not be satisfied.

And `ans` is initially determined by:
- If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos`.
- If `pos` is not less than `l` and `pos` is less than or equal to `r`, then `ans` equals 0.
- If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` equals `pos - r`.

Now, applying the code snippet `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`:

- `min(pos - 1, n - r)` will be the minimum between `pos - 1` and `n - r`. This value is added to `ans`.
- `max(0, l - 1)` will be `l - 1` if `l` is greater than 1; otherwise, it will be 0. This value is also added to `ans`.

Let's break down the possible scenarios for `ans` before the addition, considering the conditions for `pos`, `l`, and `r`:

1. If `pos < l`, then `ans = l - pos`.
2. If `l <= pos <= r`, then `ans = 0`.
3. If `pos > r`, then `ans = pos - r`.

After applying `ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`:

- For `pos < l`, `ans = l - pos + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.
- For `l <= pos <= r`, `ans = 0 + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.
- For `pos > r`, `ans = pos - r + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`.

Given the initial constraints and conditions, `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` maintain their initial values as they are not modified by the given code snippet. The value of `ans` is updated based on the provided expression.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, `ans` equals its initial value plus `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`, where the initial value of `ans` depends on the relative positions of `pos`, `l`, and `r`.**
