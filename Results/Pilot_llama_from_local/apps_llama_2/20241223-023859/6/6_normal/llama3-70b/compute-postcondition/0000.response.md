The given code maps the input values to the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of words, and `map(int,...)` converts these words to integers.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, and `r` equals the fourth input integer, where these integers are provided as input by the user, and `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` constraints may or may not be satisfied depending on the input values.**
