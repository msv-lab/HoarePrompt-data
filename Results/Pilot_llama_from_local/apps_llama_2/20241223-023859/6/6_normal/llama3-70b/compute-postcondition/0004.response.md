Postcondition: ***`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, with the constraints `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n` that may or may not be satisfied. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos`. If `pos` is not less than `l`, then the state of `ans` is unchanged, remaining as 0.***
