The print statement does not change the values of the variables, it only outputs the current value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is `ans` equals its initial value plus `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`, and this value is printed. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are not affected. Since `ans` is printed, the value of `ans` has been returned at the output state.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, `ans` equals its initial value plus `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)`, and the value of `ans` has been returned**
