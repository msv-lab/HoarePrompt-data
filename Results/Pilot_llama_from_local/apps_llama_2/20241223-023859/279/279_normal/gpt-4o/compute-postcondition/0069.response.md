The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers where for all `i`, 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p` is a permutation, and `b` is a list of integers where for all `i`, `b_i` is either 0 or 1. 

However, since the output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the given parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, p, and b where n is a positive integer, p is a permutation list of integers, and b is a binary list of integers, but the return value is not defined.**
