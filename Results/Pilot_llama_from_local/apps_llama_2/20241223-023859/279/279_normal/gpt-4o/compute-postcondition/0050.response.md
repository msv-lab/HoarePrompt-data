The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Initially, `x` is 2, so `x` becomes `p[2] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` indicates all nodes have been visited, `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle, `x` is `p[2] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing the value 2**
