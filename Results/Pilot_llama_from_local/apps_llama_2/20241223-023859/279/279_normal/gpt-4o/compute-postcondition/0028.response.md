The code assigns the value of `i` to `x`. Given that `i` is 1, `x` becomes 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1**
