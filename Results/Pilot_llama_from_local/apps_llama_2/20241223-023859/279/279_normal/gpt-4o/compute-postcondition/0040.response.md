The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. The initial value of `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, which is different from 1 and `p[1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The new value of `x` is `p[p[p[1] - 1] - 1] - 1`. Since `x` was initially in `cycle`, its new value must also be in `cycle`. Therefore, `p[p[p[1] - 1] - 1] - 1` must be equal to 1, `p[1] - 1`, or `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`. 

However, `x` cannot be equal to `p[1] - 1` because `x` is initially different from `p[1] - 1`. Also, `x` cannot be equal to `p[p[1] - 1] - 1` because this is its initial value, and `x` is updated.

So, `p[p[p[1] - 1] - 1] - 1` must be equal to 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the elements 1, `p[1] - 1`, and `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, `x` is 1, `visited[1]` is `True`, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is `True`, and `visited[p[p[1] - 1] - 1]` is `True`**
