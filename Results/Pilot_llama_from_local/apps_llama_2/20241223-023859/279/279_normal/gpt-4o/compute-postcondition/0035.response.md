The code appends the value of `x` to the `cycle` list. The value of `x` is `p[1] - 1` and is not equal to 1. The previous value of `cycle` was a list containing the single element 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the elements 1 and `p[1] - 1`, `x` is `p[1] - 1` and is not equal to 1, `visited[1]` is `True`, and `visited[x]` is `True`**
