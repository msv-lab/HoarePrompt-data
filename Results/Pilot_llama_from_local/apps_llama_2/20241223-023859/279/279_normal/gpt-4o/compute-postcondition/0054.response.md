To determine the output state, let's analyze the given line of code and its impact on the variables.

The code is:
```python
x = p[x] - 1
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements.
- `visited[x]` (where `x = p[2] - 1`) is `True`.
- `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle.
- `x` is `p[2] - 1`.
- `cycle` is a list containing the values 2 and `p[2] - 1`.

The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Since `x` is initially `p[2] - 1`, this means `x` becomes `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the given line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited[x]` (where initially `x = p[2] - 1`) is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing the values 2 and `p[2] - 1`.**
