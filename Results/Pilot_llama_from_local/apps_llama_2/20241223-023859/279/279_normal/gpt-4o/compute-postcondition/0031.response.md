The code appends the value of `x` to the `cycle` list. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is an empty list, `x` is 1, and `visited` is defined with `visited[1]` being `True`.

The value of `x` is 1, so it is appended to the `cycle` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the single element 1, `x` is 1, and `visited` is defined with `visited[1]` being `True`**
