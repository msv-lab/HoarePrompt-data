Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements. If `visited[i]` is False, then `cycle` contains a sequence of nodes representing the path from the initial node to where the loop terminates, `x` is the value of the node where the loop terminates, `visited` indicates all nodes that have been visited, and `cycles` is a list containing at least one `cycle`.***
