The code snippet declares an empty list `cycle`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `p`, `b`, or `data`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is an empty list**
