Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` has `True` for all indices in the cycle starting from 0, and `cycles` contains the sequence of indices from 0 to the termination point. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `visited` and `cycles` retaining their original values, and the other variables unchanged.***
