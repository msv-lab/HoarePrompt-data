Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating visited nodes, `cycles` is a list of lists representing cycles or paths within the graph, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles in `cycles` where all elements in the cycle are equal to 0 in `b`. The number of cycles in `cycles` is not equal to 1, meaning there are either no cycles or more than one cycle.**
