The code appends `x` to the `cycle` list. The value of `x` is `p[0] - 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` must be more than 1, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0] - 1]` is `True` and the rest (except `visited[0]` and `visited[p[0] - 1]`) are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing two elements which are 0 and `p[0] - 1`, and `x` is `p[0] - 1` and `x` must not be 0**
