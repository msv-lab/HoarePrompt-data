The code assigns `True` to `visited[x]`. Given the initial state, `x` is `p[1] - 1` and must not equal 1. The value of `x` does not change, but the value of `visited[x]` changes from `False` to `True`. The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the single element 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1` and is not equal to 1, `visited[1]` is `True`, and `visited[x]` is `True`**
