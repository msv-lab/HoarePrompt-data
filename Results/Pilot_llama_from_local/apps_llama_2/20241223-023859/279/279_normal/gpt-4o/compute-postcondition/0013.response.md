The value of `x` is appended to the `cycle` list. The previous value of `x` is 0, so the `cycle` list now contains the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and the rest are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing a single element which is 0, and `x` is 0**
