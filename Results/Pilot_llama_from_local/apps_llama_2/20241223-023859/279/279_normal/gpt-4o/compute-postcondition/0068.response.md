Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating visited nodes, `cycles` is a list of lists representing cycles or paths within the graph, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles in `cycles` where all elements in the cycle are equal to 0 in `b`. If the number of cycles is 1, then 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `no_reverse_components` is greater than 0, then `no_reverse_components` has been printed; otherwise, 1 has been printed.***
