The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of `data[0]`. The previous value of `n` as a positive integer is overwritten. The states of the other variables `p`, `b`, and `data` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to the old value of `n`, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and `data` is a list of strings read from the input**
