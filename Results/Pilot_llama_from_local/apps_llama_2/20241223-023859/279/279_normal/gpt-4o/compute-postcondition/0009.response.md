The code snippet creates a new empty list called `cycle`. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables `n`, `i`, `p`, `b`, `data`, `visited`, or `cycles`. 

Therefore, the states of these variables are unchanged, and we only have the introduction of a new variable `cycle` which is an empty list. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, and `cycle` is an empty list**
