To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `not visited[x]`. This means the loop will continue as long as `x` has not been visited.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers.
- `b` is a list of `n` integers.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements.
- `cycle` is a list containing the elements 1 and `p[1] - 1`.
- `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`.
- `visited[1]` is `True`.
- `visited[p[1] - 1]` is `True`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not have been visited, meaning `visited[x]` must be `False`. Since we are given that `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, the condition for the loop to continue is that `p[p[1] - 1] - 1` has not been visited.

Given that `visited[1]` and `visited[p[1] - 1]` are `True`, to ensure the loop can execute again, the value of `x` (which is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`) must be different from 1 and `p[1] - 1` because both of these indices have already been visited.

Therefore, the states that need adjustment are essentially about ensuring that `x` (or `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`) is a new, unvisited index. Since `n` is greater than 1 and we have at least two visited indices (1 and `p[1] - 1`), we must ensure that `p[p[1] - 1] - 1` refers to an index that has not been visited yet.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the elements 1 and `p[1] - 1`, `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1` and `x` must be different from 1 and `p[1] - 1`, `visited[1]` is `True`, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is `True`, and `visited[x]` is `False`**
