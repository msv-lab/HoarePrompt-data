To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state provides the following information:
   - `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is equal to `int(data[i])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`.
   - `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either 0 or 1.
   - `data` is a list of strings read from the input.

2. The code `b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))` updates the list `b` by slicing the `data` list from index `n + 1` to `2 * n + 1`, converting each string in this slice to an integer using `map(int,...)`, and then converting the resulting map object to a list.

Given this analysis, the output state can be described as follows:

- `n` remains an integer equal to `int(data[0])`.
- `p` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is equal to `int(data[i])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is now a list of `n` integers where each element is equal to `int(data[i])` for `i` ranging from `n + 1` to `2 * n`.
- `data` remains a list of strings read from the input.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is equal to `int(data[i])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is equal to `int(data[i])` for `i` ranging from `n + 1` to `2 * n`, and `data` is a list of strings read from the input**.
