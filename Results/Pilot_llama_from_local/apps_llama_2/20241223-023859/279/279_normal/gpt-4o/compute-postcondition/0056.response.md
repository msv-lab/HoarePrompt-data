The value of `visited[x]` is set to `True`. Given that `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, the value of `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is changed to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True`, `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing the values 2 and `p[2] - 1`.**
