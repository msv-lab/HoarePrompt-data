The value of `visited[x]` is set to `True`, where `x` is `p[0] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `p[0]` must be more than 1 and `x` is `p[0] - 1`, `x` is at least 1 and not 0. This means `visited[1]` or any `visited` index greater than 1 (but less than `n`) is set to `True`, in addition to `visited[0]` which was already `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` must be more than 1, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True` and `visited[p[0] - 1]` is `True` and the rest (except `visited[0]` and `visited[p[0] - 1]`) are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing a single element which is 0, and `x` is `p[0] - 1` and `x` must not be 0**
