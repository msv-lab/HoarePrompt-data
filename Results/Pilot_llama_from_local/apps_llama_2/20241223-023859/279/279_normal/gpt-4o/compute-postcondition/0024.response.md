The provided code snippet appends the `cycle` to the `cycles` list. The `cycle` contains the sequence of indices from 0 to the termination point, and `x` is the index where the loop terminated due to revisiting, which is an index in `cycle`. The values of `n`, `i`, `p`, `b`, `data`, and `visited` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is unchanged, `i` is 0, `p` and `b` are unchanged, `data` is unchanged, `visited` has `True` for all indices in the cycle starting from 0, `cycles` contains the sequence of indices from 0 to the termination point (i.e., `cycles` = [sequence of indices in `cycle`]), and `cycle` contains the sequence of indices from 0 to the termination point, and `x` is the index where the loop terminated due to revisiting, which is an index in `cycle`.**
