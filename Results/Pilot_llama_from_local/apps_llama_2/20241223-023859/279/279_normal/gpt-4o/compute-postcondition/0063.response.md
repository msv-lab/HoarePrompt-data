The code calculates the sum of all cycles in the `cycles` list where all elements in the cycle are equal to 0 in the `b` list. This calculation is assigned to the variable `no_reverse_components`. 

The previous values of the variables are: `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating visited nodes, and `cycles` is a list of lists representing cycles or paths within the graph.

After executing the code, `no_reverse_components` is assigned the sum of all cycles with all elements equal to 0 in `b`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating visited nodes, `cycles` is a list of lists representing cycles or paths within the graph, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles in `cycles` where all elements in the cycle are equal to 0 in `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating visited nodes, `cycles` is a list of lists representing cycles or paths within the graph, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles in `cycles` where all elements in the cycle are equal to 0 in `b`.**
