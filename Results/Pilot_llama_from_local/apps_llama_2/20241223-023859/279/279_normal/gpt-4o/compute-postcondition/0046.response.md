The code `x = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2. Therefore, `x` becomes 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `p` and `b` are still lists of `n` integers, `data` is still a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` still indicates all nodes that have been visited, `cycles` is still a list containing at least one `cycle`, and `cycle` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` indicates all nodes that have been visited, `cycles` is a list containing at least one `cycle`, `x` is 2, and `cycle` is an empty list**
