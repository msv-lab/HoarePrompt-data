The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Initially, `x` is 1 and `visited[1]` is `True`. The value of `p[x]` is `p[1]` when `x` is 1, so `x` becomes `p[1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the single element 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and `visited` is defined with `visited[1]` being `True`**
