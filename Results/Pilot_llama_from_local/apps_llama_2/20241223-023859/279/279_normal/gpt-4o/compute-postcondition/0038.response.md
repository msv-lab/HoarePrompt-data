The code sets `visited[x]` to `True`. The value of `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, which must be different from 1 and `p[1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `cycle` is a list containing the elements 1 and `p[1] - 1`, `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1` and `x` must be different from 1 and `p[1] - 1`, `visited[1]` is `True`, `visited[p[1] - 1]` is `True`, and `visited[x]` is `True`**
