The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the `cycle` list. The value of `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` must be more than 1, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True`, `visited[p[0] - 1]` is `True`, `visited[x]` is `True`, and the rest (except `visited[0]`, `visited[p[0] - 1]`, and `visited[x]`) are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing three elements which are 0, `p[0] - 1`, and `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` must be more than 1, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True`, `visited[p[0] - 1]` is `True`, `visited[p[p[0] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, and the rest (except `visited[0]`, `visited[p[0] - 1]`, and `visited[p[p[0] - 1] - 1]`) are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is a list containing three elements which are 0, `p[0] - 1`, and `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1**
