The code `x = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is equal to `i`, which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 0**
