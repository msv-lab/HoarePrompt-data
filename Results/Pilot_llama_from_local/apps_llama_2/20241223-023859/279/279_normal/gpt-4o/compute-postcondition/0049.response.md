The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the `cycle` list. Given that `x` is 2, this means `cycle` will now contain the value 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` remains 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` still indicates all nodes have been visited, `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle, and `x` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited` indicates all nodes have been visited, `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle, `x` is 2, and `cycle` is a list containing the value 2.**
