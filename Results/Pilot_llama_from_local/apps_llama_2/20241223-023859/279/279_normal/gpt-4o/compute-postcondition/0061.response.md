Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements. If `visited[i]` is False, then `cycles` contains an additional cycle which is the sequence of nodes visited from the original node 2 to the last visited node before the loop terminated, and `x` remains the last node in the cycle that was visited. The lists `p`, `b`, and `data`, and the values of `n` and `i`, remain unchanged. The state of `visited` and the `cycle` variable itself also remain unchanged.***
