The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin`, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as a delimiter, and assigns it to `data`. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either 0 or 1, and `data` is a list of strings read from the input, `input` is an alias for `sys.stdin.read`.**
