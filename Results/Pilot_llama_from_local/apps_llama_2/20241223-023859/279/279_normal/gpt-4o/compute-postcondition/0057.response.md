To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements.
- `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True`.
- `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`.
- `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle.
- `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`.
- `cycle` is a list containing the values 2 and `p[2] - 1`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
cycle.append(x)
```
This line of code appends the value of `x` to the end of the `cycle` list. Given that `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, this value is added to `cycle`.

The output state, considering the changes made by the code, is as follows:
- `n` is still a non-negative integer greater than 2.
- `i` remains 2.
- `p` and `b` are still lists of `n` integers.
- `data` is still a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements.
- `visited[p[2] - 1]` is still `True`.
- `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is still `True`.
- `cycles` is still a list containing at least one cycle.
- `x` is still `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`.
- `cycle` now contains the values 2, `p[2] - 1`, and `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `p` and `b` are lists of `n` integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `2 * n + 1` elements, `visited[p[2] - 1]` is `True`, `visited[p[p[2] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least one cycle, `x` is `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing the values 2, `p[2] - 1`, and `p[p[2] - 1] - 1`.**
