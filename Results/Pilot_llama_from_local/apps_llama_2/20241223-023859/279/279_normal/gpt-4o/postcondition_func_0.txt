The function reads input from the standard input, which consists of a positive integer n, a permutation list p of integers, and a binary list b of integers. After processing the input, it identifies cycles in the permutation p and counts the number of cycles where all elements are 0 in the binary list b. If there is only one cycle, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of cycles with all zeros if such cycles exist; otherwise, it prints 1. The function does not return any value and only prints the result to the console. It handles the case where the number of cycles is greater than 1 and where there are cycles with and without zeros in the binary list b. The function assumes that the input is valid and does not contain any error checking or handling for invalid inputs.
