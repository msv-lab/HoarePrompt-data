Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, parsing the integer `n`, the permutation list `p`, and the binary list `b`.
2. **Cycle Detection**: The program correctly detects cycles in the permutation `p` by iterating through the list and marking visited nodes. This is done using a `visited` list and a `cycles` list to store the detected cycles.
3. **Counting No-Reverse Components**: The program correctly counts the number of cycles where all elements are 0 in the binary list `b`. This is done using a generator expression within the `sum` function.
4. **Printing the Result**: The program prints the correct result based on the number of cycles and the presence of no-reverse components. If there is only one cycle, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of no-reverse components if there are any; otherwise, it prints 1.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When there is only one cycle, it prints 0.
* When there are multiple cycles and at least one cycle has all zeros, it prints the count of no-reverse components.
* When there are multiple cycles and no cycle has all zeros, it prints 1.

The program assumes that the input is valid, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it does not include error handling for invalid inputs. However, within the scope of the problem description and the assumption of valid input, the program correctly implements the required functionality.
