#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but implicitly uses input variables n, p, and b where n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and b is a list of zeros and ones of length n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is the count of indices where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` or `b[i]` is equal to 0, for all `i` in the range of `n`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0, `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the total count of indices where the permutation list `p` does not match its corresponding index (1-indexed) or the binary list `b` has a value of 0, based on user input for `n`, `p`, and `b`. The function accepts no explicit parameters but relies on three inputs: a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary list `b` of length `n`. After execution, the function prints the calculated count to the console, effectively providing a measure of how much `p` deviates from the identity permutation and how many zeros are in `b`, without modifying the input lists. The function handles cases where `n` is 0 by not executing the loop and printing 0, considering `n` as part of the input validation implicitly performed by the code's logic, although it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might not be a positive integer or `p` and `b` might not match the expected formats, which could lead to errors.
