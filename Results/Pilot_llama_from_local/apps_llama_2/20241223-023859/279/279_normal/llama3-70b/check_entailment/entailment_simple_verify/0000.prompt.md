You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It increments the answer by 1 whenever it encounters an element in the permutation that is not equal to its 1-based index or an element in the sequence that is 0. However, this approach does not take into account the actual cycles in the permutation and the distribution of 1s in the sequence.

A counterexample can be constructed by considering the permutation [2, 3, 1, 4] and the sequence [1, 1, 1, 1]. In this case, the program would output 3, but the correct answer is 0, because the given permutation and sequence already allow every skewer to visit each of the 2n placements.

The correct approach would be to identify the cycles in the permutation, check if the number of 1s in the sequence is odd or even, and determine the minimum number of changes needed to ensure that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

Here's a hint for the correct solution: consider using a cycle detection algorithm to find the cycles in the permutation, and then analyze the distribution of 1s in the sequence to determine the minimum number of changes needed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but implicitly uses input variables n, p, and b where n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and b is a list of zeros and ones of length n.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if p[i] != i + 1:
            ans += 1
        
        if b[i] == 0:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is `n-1`, and `ans` is the count of indices where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` or `b[i]` is equal to 0, for all `i` in the range of `n`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains 0, `i` is undefined in the context of the loop's execution.
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
