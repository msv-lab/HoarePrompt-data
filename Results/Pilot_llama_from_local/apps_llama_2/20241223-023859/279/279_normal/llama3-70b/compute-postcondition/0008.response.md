Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0. The current value of `ans` is either 0 or 1, where if `p[i]` was not equal to `i + 1`, then the current value of `ans` is 1, otherwise the current value of `ans` is 0. The current value of `b` at index `i` is 0.**
