Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the total count of indices where the permutation list `p` does not match its corresponding index (1-indexed) or the binary list `b` has a value of 0, based on user input for `n`, `p`, and `b`. The function accepts no explicit parameters but relies on three inputs: a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary list `b` of length `n`. After execution, the function prints the calculated count to the console, effectively providing a measure of how much `p` deviates from the identity permutation and how many zeros are in `b`, without modifying the input lists. The function handles cases where `n` is 0 by not executing the loop and printing 0, considering `n` as part of the input validation implicitly performed by the code's logic, although it does not explicitly handle cases where `n` might not be a positive integer or `p` and `b` might not match the expected formats, which could lead to errors.**
