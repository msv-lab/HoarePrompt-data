The value of `n` is updated to `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specified that `n` is a positive integer, but now `n` is assigned a new value from the input. The states of the other variables `p` and `b` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to the original value of `n`, `b` is a list of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n`**
