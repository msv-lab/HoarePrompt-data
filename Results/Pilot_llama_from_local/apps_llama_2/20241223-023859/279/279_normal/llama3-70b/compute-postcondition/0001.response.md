The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `p` by taking a new input, splitting it into integers, and assigning it to `p`. The previous value of `p` as a permutation of numbers from 1 to the original value of `n` is overwritten. The new value of `p` is a list of integers based on the new input. The values of `n` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n`**
