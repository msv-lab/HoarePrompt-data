Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1. If `b[i]` equals 0, then `ans` is at least 1 and is either 1 if `p[1]` equals 2 or 2 if `p[1]` does not equal 2. If `b[i]` does not equal 0, then the state of `ans` remains the same as the initial state after the precondition, which is at least 1 and is either 1 if `p[1]` equals 2 or 2 if `p[1]` does not equal 2.**
