Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0. If `b[i]` is 0, then `ans` is either 1 or 2. If `b[i]` is not 0, then the state of the program remains unchanged, and `ans` is 1 if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, otherwise `ans` remains 0.**
