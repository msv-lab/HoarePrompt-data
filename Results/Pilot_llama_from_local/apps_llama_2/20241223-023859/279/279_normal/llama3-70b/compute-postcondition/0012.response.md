To calculate the result, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `ans`. Since `ans` is not defined in the initial state, we can infer that `ans` is likely initialized to 0 before this line of code, but this is not explicitly stated. 

Given the information provided in the initial state: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, and assuming `ans` must have been initialized to some value before being incremented (since you cannot increment an undefined variable in Python without causing an error), the most accurate initial state for `ans` we can assume without further information would be that `ans` has some initial integer value.

Therefore, the code increments `ans` by 1, but without a specific initial value for `ans`, we cannot determine its exact new value. The states of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 from its initial value**
