The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `b` to be a list of integers input by the user. The original value of `b` as a list of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n` is lost. The new value of `b` is a list of input integers. The states of the other variables, `n` and `p`, are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers**
