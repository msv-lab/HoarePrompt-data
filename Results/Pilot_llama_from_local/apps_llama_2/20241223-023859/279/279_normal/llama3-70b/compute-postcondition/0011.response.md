To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of input integers.
- `b` is a list of input integers.
- `i` is 0.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

Since `n` is greater than 0 and the loop has not finished yet, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `p`, `b`, and `ans` depends on the values of `b[i]` and `p[i]`, but these are not directly affected by the loop iteration itself. However, since `i` changes, the elements of `p` and `b` being considered will change.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1**
