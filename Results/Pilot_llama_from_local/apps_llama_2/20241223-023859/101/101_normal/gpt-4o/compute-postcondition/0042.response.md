The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. Since `j` is 2, `left` is also 2. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `left` is 2**
