Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `right` is 2, `bottom` is 2, if `j` is greater than `right`, then the state of the program remains as specified with the relationship with `top` if `i` is less than `top` and `j` is less than `left`, otherwise, the state remains unchanged, maintaining the initial conditions.***
