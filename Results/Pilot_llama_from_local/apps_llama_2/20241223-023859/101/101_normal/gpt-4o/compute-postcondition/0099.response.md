Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`, or are `None` if no 'w' characters are found. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
