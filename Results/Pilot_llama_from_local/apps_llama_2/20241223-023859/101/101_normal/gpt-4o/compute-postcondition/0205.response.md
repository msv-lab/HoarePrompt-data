The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers with constraints 1 <= `n` <= 2000 and 1 <= `m` <= 2000, and `screen`, which is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. 

After executing the function body, the function returns: 
Case_1: -1 
Case_2: -1 
Case_3: the modified 2D list `result` where all '.' characters on the borders defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' have been replaced with '+'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `screen`, and return either -1 or the modified 2D list `result` based on the 'screen' after replacing the '.' characters on the borders with '+'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and screen, and returns either -1 or the modified 2D list where '.' characters on the borders have been replaced with '+', based on the input screen.**
