Output State: **The program returns the modified 2D list 'result' where all '.' characters on the borders defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' have been replaced with '+'. The 'result' is based on the 'screen' which is a 2D list of strings with length 'm' and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. The 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' are the bounding box of all 'w' characters in 'screen', with 'frame_height' being 'bottom - top + 1' and 'frame_width' being 'right - left + 1', both of which are greater than or equal to 2.**
