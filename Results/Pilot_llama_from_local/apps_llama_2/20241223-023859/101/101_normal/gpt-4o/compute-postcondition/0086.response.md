The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, and `top` is equal to `i`, and `i` is still in its previous state.
