Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m > 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. If `top` is None, then `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` is 2. If `top` is not None, then if `j` is greater than `right`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `right` is 2; otherwise, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the state of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remains unchanged.**
