Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 2, `right` is 2; otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, the state of the program remains with the specified relationship with `top` if `i` is less than `top` and `j` is less than `left`, otherwise the state remains unchanged with `right` being 2 and `bottom` being 2. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state of the program remains unchanged.***
