Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0; otherwise, if `i` > `bottom`, then `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0; if `j` < `left`, then `left` is 0; if `j` > `right`, then `right` is `j`, otherwise, the value of `right` remains unchanged. If the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is not 'w', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
