Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `top` is None, then `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than `left`, then `bottom` is 2 and `left` is 1. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` equals 1, otherwise the state of `right` remains unchanged.***
