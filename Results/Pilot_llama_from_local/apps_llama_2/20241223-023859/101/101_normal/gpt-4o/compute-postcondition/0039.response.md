Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, then `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `top` is 0. Since there is no else part, if `i` is not less than `top`, there is no specified change to the variables, so `i` is 0, `j` is 2, regardless of the value of `top`.***
