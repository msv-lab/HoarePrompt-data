According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
