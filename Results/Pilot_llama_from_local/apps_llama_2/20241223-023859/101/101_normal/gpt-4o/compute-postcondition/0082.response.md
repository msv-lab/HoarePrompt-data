Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 1, and `right` is 1 if `top` is None. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `left` is 1, and the values of `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are updated based on the values of `j` and `i`: if `j` > `right`, then `right` is `j`; if `j` < `left`, then `left` is `j`; if `i` < `top`, then `top` is `i`; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the state remains unchanged.**
