The code `left = j` updates the value of `left` to be equal to the current value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `j` is less than `left` initially and `left` is now equal to `j`, the new value of `left` is less than its initial value. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 1, otherwise `top` is greater than `i`, `left` is 0, `right` are the bounds of the 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` and are not `None`, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `bottom` is either less than `i` or equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 1, otherwise `top` is greater than `i`, `left` is 0, `right` are the bounds of the 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` and are not `None`, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and `bottom` is either less than `i` or equal to `i`**
