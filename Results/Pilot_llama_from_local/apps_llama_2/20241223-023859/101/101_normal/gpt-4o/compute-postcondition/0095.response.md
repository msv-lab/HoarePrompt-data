Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated accordingly to bound the 'w' character, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
