Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `top` is not None and has a value such that it can be compared to `i`, the current value of `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, and the current value of `i` is less than the current value of `top`**
