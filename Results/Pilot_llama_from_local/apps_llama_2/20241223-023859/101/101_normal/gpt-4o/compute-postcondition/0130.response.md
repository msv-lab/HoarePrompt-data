Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` equals 'w', then if `top` is None, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 1, `right` is 1; otherwise, if `j` is less than `left`, `bottom` is 2 and `left` is 1, if `j` is greater than `right`, `right` equals 1, otherwise the state of `right` remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` does not equal 'w', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
