Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `top`, `j` is `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen`. The current value of `i` is either equal to the current value of `top` or the current value of `bottom`, or the current value of `j` is equal to the current value of `left` or the current value of `right`. The character at the current position (`i`, `j`) in `result` is '.'**
