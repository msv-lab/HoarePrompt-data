The given code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0. Therefore, both `left` and `right` are assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', the current value of `screen` at position `[0][0]` is 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
