Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and if `i` is less than `top`, then the conditions of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, and `top` are as specified in the if part, otherwise, there is no change in the state as there is no else part***
