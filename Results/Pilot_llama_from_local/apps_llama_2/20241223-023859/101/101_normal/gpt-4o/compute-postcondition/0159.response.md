The character at position (`i`, `j`) in `result` is updated to '+'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, 
`m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, 
`screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', 
`i` is `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, 
`j` is `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`, 
`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, 
representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, 
`frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, 
`frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, 
`result` is a copy of `screen` where the character at the current position (`i`, `j`) is '+'.
