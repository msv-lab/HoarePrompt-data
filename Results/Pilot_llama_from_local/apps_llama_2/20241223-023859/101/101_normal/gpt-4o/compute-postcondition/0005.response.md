The code updates the values of `top` and `bottom` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, both `top` and `bottom` become 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', the current value of `screen` at position `[0][0]` is 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
