The code assigns the value of `i` to `top`. The value of `i` is 0, so `top` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0**
