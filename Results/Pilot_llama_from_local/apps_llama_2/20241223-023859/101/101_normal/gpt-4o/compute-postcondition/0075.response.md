The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so the value of `bottom` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `bottom` is 1, and the condition `i < top` is either true or false**
