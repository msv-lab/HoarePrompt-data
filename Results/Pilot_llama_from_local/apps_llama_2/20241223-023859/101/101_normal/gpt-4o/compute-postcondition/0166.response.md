To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop condition, which is `for j in range(left, right + 1)`. This loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `right + 1`. Since `j` is one more than the previous value at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000 (no change needed)
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000 (no change needed)
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w' (no change needed)
- `i` is a position within the bounds of `screen` (no change needed)
- `j` is a position within the bounds of `screen` and is one more than the previous value, so for the loop to execute again, `j` should be incremented by 1
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen` (no change needed)
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2 (no change needed)
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2 (no change needed)
- `result` is a copy of `screen` where if the character at the current position (`i`, `j`) is on the border of the bounding box, and the character is '.', it is updated to '+', otherwise it remains unchanged (since `j` changes, the update rule may apply differently, but the nature of `result` being a copy of `screen` with potential updates based on border conditions remains)

For `j` to be valid for the next iteration, it must still be within the range `left` to `right + 1`. Since `j` at the end of the last iteration is one more than the previous value and we are incrementing it by 1 for the next iteration, `j` will be valid as long as it does not exceed `right`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is a position within the bounds of `screen`, `j` is one more than its previous value and within the bounds of `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen` with updates based on the border conditions**
