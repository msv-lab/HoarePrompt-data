The code creates a new 2D list `result` by copying each row from the `screen` 2D list. This means that `result` will have the same dimensions and contents as `screen`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`. The `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and the `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2, and `result` is a copy of `screen`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`, `result` is a copy of `screen`, the `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and the `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2**
