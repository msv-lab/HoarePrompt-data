Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and if `j` is less than `left`, then the state of the program remains as specified, otherwise, the state remains unchanged, maintaining the initial conditions, with `bottom` being 2, and the relationship with `top` if `i` is less than `top`.***
