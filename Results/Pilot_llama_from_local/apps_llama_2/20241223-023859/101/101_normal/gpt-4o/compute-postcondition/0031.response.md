The value of `right` becomes equal to the value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `j` is 1 if `j` < `left` and `left` is 1, then `j` is 1 and `right` is also 1. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 0 and `top` is 0. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `left` is 1, `j` is 1, `right` is 1, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 0 and `top` is 0, otherwise no changes are made.
