Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is `None`, `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0; otherwise, if `j` is greater than the previous `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, and `left` is 0. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state remains unchanged as in the precondition, with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`.**
