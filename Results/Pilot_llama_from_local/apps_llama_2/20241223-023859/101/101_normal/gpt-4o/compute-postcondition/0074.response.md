Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the condition `i < top` is either true or false, but since there's no else part with modifications, the state remains the same as the precondition with `i < top` being true when `top` is greater than 1**
