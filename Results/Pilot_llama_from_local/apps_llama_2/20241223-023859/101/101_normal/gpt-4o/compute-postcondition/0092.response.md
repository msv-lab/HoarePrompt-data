The code assigns the value of `j` to `right`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, `left`, `top`, `bottom`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, `right` is equal to `j`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`. Additionally, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`**
