Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, where `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list `screen`, and `screen` is a 2D list of strings with length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. The function returns either -1 or the modified 2D list where '.' characters on the borders of the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen` have been replaced with '+'. The function first checks if there are any 'w' characters in the `screen`. If not, or if the bounding box of the 'w' characters has a height or width less than 2, it returns -1. If the 'w' characters form a valid bounding box with a height and width of at least 2, it creates a copy of the `screen`, replaces the '.' characters on the borders of the bounding box with '+', and returns this modified 2D list. The function handles edge cases where the 'w' characters may be located at the edges of the `screen`, and it correctly calculates the bounding box and modifies the borders accordingly.**
