`frame_width` is assigned the value `right - left + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, and `frame_width` is `right - left + 1`.
