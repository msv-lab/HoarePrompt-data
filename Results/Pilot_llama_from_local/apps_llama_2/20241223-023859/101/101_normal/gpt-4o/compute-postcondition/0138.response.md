The variable `left` is assigned the value of `j`. The initial value of `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `left` is 2, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the state of the program remains as specified, with `bottom` being 2, otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part, implying that if `i` is not greater than `bottom`, the program's state is unaffected, maintaining the initial conditions of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, and the relationship with `top` if `i` is less than `top`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `left` is 2, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the state of the program remains as specified, with `bottom` being 2, otherwise, the state remains unchanged**
