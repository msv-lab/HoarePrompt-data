The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given the initial state where `j` is 0, this means both `left` and `right` will be assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
