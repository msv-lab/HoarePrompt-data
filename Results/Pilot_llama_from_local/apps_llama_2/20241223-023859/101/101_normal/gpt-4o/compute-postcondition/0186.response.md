To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(left, right + 1):
    if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
        if result[i][j] == '.':
            result[i][j] = '+'
```
From the loop code, we can see that it iterates over the columns of the `result` 2D list, from `left` to `right` (inclusive). For each column `j`, it checks if the current row `i` is either the top or bottom border, or if the current column `j` is either the left or right border. If any of these conditions are true, it checks if the current cell `result[i][j]` is equal to '.'. If it is, it updates the cell to '+'.

Now, let's analyze the output states for the first few iterations:

* After 1 iteration, `result[i][j]` has been updated to '+' if `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, and `j` is equal to `left`.
* After 2 iterations, `result[i][j]` has been updated to '+' if `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, and `j` is equal to `left + 1`.
* After 3 iterations, `result[i][j]` has been updated to '+' if `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, and `j` is equal to `left + 2`.

From these output states, we can see that the loop is updating the border cells of the `result` 2D list to '+', and the value of `j` is incrementing by 1 in each iteration.

Since the loop iterates over the range `left` to `right + 1`, the final value of `j` will be `right`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a 2D list where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is equal to `right`.

However, if the loop does not execute (i.e., `left` is greater than `right`), the output state will be the same as the initial state, since the loop will not modify the `result` 2D list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a 2D list where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2**
