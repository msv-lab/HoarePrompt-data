The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Given that `i` is 1, `top` and `bottom` are now both equal to 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1**
