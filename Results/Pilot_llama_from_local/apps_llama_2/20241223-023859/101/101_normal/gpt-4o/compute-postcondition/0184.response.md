Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a 2D list where if `result[i][j]` was '.', it has been updated to '+' when `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right` or the current `result[i][j]` is '.', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is the current value of `j` plus one but not greater than `right`, and if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+', otherwise `result[i][j]` remains the same**
