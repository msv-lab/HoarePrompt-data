The value of `left` is updated to be equal to the current value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, 
`m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, 
`screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 0, 
the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', 
if `i` > `bottom`, then the current value of `top` is 0, 
the current value of `bottom` is 0, 
`right` is None, 
`left` is equal to `j` (which is 0), 
and the current value of `j` is less than or equal to the current value of `left` (which is 0).
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', if `i` > `bottom`, then the current value of `top` is 0, the current value of `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is None**
