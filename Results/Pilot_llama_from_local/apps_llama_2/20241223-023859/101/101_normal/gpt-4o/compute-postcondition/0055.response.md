Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are the bounds of the 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` and are not `None`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.**
