To determine the output state, we first examine the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is given as follows:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2.
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
top = bottom = i
```

Given the code, we can see that it assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since `i` is 0, both `top` and `bottom` are assigned the value 0.

The output state is thus determined by the initial state and the changes made by the code snippet:
- `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2.
- `screen` remains a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains 2.
- `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0.
- `bottom` is also assigned the value of `i`, which is 0.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged initial conditions for `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, and `j`, and the new assignments for `top` and `bottom`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m > 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
