The code assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are not changed by this operation. The state of `left` is updated to be equal to `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, `left` is equal to `j`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`**
