Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is a position within the bounds of `screen`, `j` is a position within the bounds of `screen` and is one more than the previous value, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen` where if the character at the current position (`i`, `j`) is on the border of the bounding box (i.e., `i` is `top`, `bottom`, or `j` is `left` or `right`), and the character is '.', it is updated to '+', otherwise it remains unchanged, and specifically, if `result[i][j]` is '.', it is updated to '+', otherwise no change occurs**
