To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1.
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 0.

Given the code:
```python
bottom = i
```

This code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bottom`. Given that `i` is 0, `bottom` will be assigned the value 0.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, and `top`) are not directly affected by this assignment. However, since `i` equals 0 and it's less than any positive `top`, and given the condition that if `i` is less than `top` then `top` is 0, `top` remains 0 because `i` is indeed less than any possible positive value of `top`, but since `i` and `bottom` are 0, and there is no direct modification to `top`, we consider `top` in the context of being equal to 0 based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1.
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 1.
- `bottom` is 0.
- If the condition for `top` is considered with `i` being 0, then `top` is 0 because there's no indication that `i` has changed, thus not altering the condition that would make `top` anything other than 0 based on the initial state description.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `bottom` is 0, and `top` is 0**
