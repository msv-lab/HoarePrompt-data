The value of `right` is updated to be equal to the current value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `j` is greater than `right` initially, the new value of `right` is greater than its initial value. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 0, otherwise `j` is not less than `left`, `right` is equal to `j`, `top` is either 1 or greater than `i`, and `bottom` is either less than `i` or equal to `i`**
