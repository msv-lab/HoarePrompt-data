Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. If `j` is less than `left`, then `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `bottom` equals 2, and `left` equals 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains the same as the initial state with `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 1***
