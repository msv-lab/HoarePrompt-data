Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are `None`, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', indicating that no 'w' characters were found in the first row of `screen`, resulting in the bounding box variables being `None`.**
