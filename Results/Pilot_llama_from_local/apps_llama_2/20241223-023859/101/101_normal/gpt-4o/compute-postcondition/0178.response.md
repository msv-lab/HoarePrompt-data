According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `left` and `right`. If `j` is less than `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last value of `j` plus one but not greater than `right`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, but still within the range from `left` to `right`. Therefore, the new value of `j` should be the current value of `j` plus one, but not greater than `right`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a copy of `screen` where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, except that if `result[i][j]` was '.', it has been updated to '+' when `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, the current value of `i` remains the same, the current value of `j` is the current value of `j` plus one but not greater than `right`**
