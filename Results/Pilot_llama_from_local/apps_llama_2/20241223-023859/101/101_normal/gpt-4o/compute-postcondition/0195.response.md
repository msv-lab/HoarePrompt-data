The value of `result[i][j]` is updated to '+'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is `top + 1` and `j` is `left + 1`, and given the conditions that define the borders, `result[top + 1][left + 1]` is now '+'.

The conditions that `1 <= n <= 2000`, `1 <= m <= 2000`, and the definitions of `screen`, `result`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` remain unchanged. The relationship between `i` and `j` with `top` and `left` also remains the same, but now we have a specific update to `result[i][j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a 2D list where `result[top + 1][left + 1]` is '+', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `i` is `top + 1`, and `j` is `left + 1`.**
