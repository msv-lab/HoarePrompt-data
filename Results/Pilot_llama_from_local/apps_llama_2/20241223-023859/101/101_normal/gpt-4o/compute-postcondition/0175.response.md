The code `result[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `result[i][j]` to '+'. The previous value of `result[i][j]` was '.', and this change occurs when (`i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`). 

The states of the other variables are not affected: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2. Also, the current value of `i` is the last value of `i` plus one but not greater than `bottom`, the current value of `j` is `left`. 

The value of `result` is updated at position `[i][j]` to '+', given that this position was previously '.'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a copy of `screen` where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, except at position `[i][j]` which has been updated to '+', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, the current value of `i` is the last value of `i` plus one but not greater than `bottom`, the current value of `j` is `left`, and (`i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`)**
