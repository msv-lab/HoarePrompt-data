The values of `top` and `bottom` are updated to be equal to `i`. The value of `i` is given as 2, so `top` and `bottom` become 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, and `left` and `right` are `None`.**
