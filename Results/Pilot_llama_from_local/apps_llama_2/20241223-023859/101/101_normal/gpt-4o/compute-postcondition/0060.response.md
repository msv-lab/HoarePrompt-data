The value of `bottom` is updated to be equal to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is greater than `bottom` initially and now `bottom` is equal to `i`, the condition that `i` is greater than `bottom` is no longer true. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 1, otherwise `top` is greater than `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left`, `right` are the bounds of the 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` and are not `None`, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
