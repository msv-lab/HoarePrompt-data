Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 0, otherwise `j` is not less than `left`, `right` are the bounds of the 'w' characters in the first row of `screen` and are not `None`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 1, otherwise `top` is greater than `i`, and `bottom` is either less than `i` or equal to `i`, and `j` is 0.**
