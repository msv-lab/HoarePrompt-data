The given code `left = right = j` updates the values of `left` and `right` to be equal to `j`. Since `j` is 1, both `left` and `right` become 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
