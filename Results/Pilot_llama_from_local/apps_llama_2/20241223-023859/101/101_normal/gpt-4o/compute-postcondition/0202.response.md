To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the information provided in the output states after the loop executes some number of times.

The loop code iterates over a range from `left` to `right + 1` (inclusive) and checks if the current position `(i, j)` is on the border of the frame defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. If it is, and the character at that position in `result` is '.', it replaces the character with '+'.

From the output states after the loop executes some number of times, we can infer the following:

- The loop will execute at least once if `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
- The value of `i` remains constant throughout the execution of this loop, starting at `top + 1`.
- The value of `j` increments from `left` to `right` (inclusive) during each iteration.
- If a position `(i, j)` is on the border (i.e., `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`), and the original value of `result[i][j]` is '.', then after the loop, `result[i][j]` will be '+'; otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.

Given that the loop iterates over all `j` values from `left` to `right` (inclusive) for a fixed `i` starting at `top + 1`, after all iterations, `j` will have reached `right`. 

Since `i` starts at `top + 1` and does not change during this loop, and the loop only checks and potentially modifies `result[i][j]` for each `j` in the given range, the modifications to `result` will be limited to the row where `i = top + 1`.

However, the problem statement provides information about the loop's behavior in the context of a larger program, where `i` might be iterated over a range that covers all rows from `top` to `bottom`. But focusing strictly on the given loop, we're only considering the effects on a single row defined by `i = top + 1`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will have the following characteristics:

- `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000.
- `screen` remains a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'.
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
- `left` must be less than or equal to `right`.
- `i` is `top + 1`.
- `j` will be `right` after the loop finishes.
- For the row where `i = top + 1`, if any character on the border (i.e., the first or last character of the row, or the characters in the columns `left` and `right`) was originally '.', it will have been replaced with '+'.

However, considering the specific instructions and the format required for the answer, the focus should be on the outcome directly related to the loop's execution, which is the modification of the `result` list according to the positions on the borders.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` has all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` replaced with '+', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` equals `top + 1`, and `j` equals `right`.**
