Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. Regardless of the value of `bottom`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `top` is 0, since there is no specified change to the variables when `i` is not less than `top` and no else part to modify the variables when `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`.***
