Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`.**
