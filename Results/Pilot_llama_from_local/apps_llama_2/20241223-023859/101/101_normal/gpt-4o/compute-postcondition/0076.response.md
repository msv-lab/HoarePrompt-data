Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and the condition `i < top` is either true or false, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the state remains the same with `bottom` being 1, otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there's no else part with modifications.***
