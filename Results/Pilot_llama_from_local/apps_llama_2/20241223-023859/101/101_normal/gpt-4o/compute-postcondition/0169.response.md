Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is a position within the bounds of `screen`, `j` is one more than its previous value and within the bounds of `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen` with updates based on the border conditions, and if `i` is at the top or bottom border or `j` is at the left or right border of `screen`, then `result[i][j]` is updated to '+' if it was '.', otherwise `result` remains unchanged***
