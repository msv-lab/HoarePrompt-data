Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, if `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top` is either 1 or greater than `i` if it was not `None`, or 1 if it was `None`, `bottom` is either less than `i` or equal to `i`, and `left` and `right` are updated based on the value of `j` such that if `j` is less than `left`, `left` is 0, and if `j` is greater than `right`, `right` is equal to `j`; otherwise, the state of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remains unchanged, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is either 'w' or '.'.**
