The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `bottom` is 0**
