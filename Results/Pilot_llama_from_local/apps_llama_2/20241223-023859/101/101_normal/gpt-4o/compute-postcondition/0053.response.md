`top` and `bottom` are assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and `m` must be greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
