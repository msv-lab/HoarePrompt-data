Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a copy of `screen` where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, except that if `result[i][j]` was '.', it has been updated to '+', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, the current value of `i` is the last value of `i` plus one but not greater than `bottom`, the current value of `j` is `left`, and (`i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`)**
