Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` equals 1. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and `bottom` equals 2. Since `i` equals 2, the condition `i` > `bottom` will be false because `bottom` equals 2, so the state of the program will remain the same as the initial state, with `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 1.***
