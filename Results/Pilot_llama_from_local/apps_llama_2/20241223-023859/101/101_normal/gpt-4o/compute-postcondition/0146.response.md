Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and the current values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, or are `None` if no 'w' characters are found. At least one of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` is `None`, indicating that either no 'w' characters are found in `screen` or the bounding box is not fully defined.**
