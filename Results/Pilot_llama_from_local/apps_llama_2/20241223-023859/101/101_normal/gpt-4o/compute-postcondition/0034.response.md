Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is None, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `left` is 1 and `right` is 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 0 and `top` is 0; no changes are made to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` if neither condition is met. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then no changes are made to any variables.***
