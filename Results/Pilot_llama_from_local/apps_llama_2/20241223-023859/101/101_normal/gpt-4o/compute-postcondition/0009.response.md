The code `top = i` assigns the value of `i` to `top`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 0, `top` is now 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `top` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None**
