The value of `result[i][j]` is updated to '+'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, 
`m` is still an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, 
`screen` is still a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', 
`i` is still a position within the bounds of `screen`, 
`j` is still one more than its previous value and within the bounds of `screen`, 
`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are still not `None`, 
`frame_height` is still `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, 
`frame_width` is still `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, 
`result` is still a copy of `screen` but with `result[i][j]` updated to '+'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is a position within the bounds of `screen`, `j` is one more than its previous value and within the bounds of `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen` with `result[i][j]` = '+'**
