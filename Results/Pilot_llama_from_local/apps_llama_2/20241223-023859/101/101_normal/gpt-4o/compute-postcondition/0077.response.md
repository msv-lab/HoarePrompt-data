The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, 
`m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, 
`screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 1, 
`left` is 1, 
and the condition `i < top` is either true or false, 
and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1, otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `left` is 1, and the condition `i < top` is either true or false, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1, otherwise, the state remains unchanged**
