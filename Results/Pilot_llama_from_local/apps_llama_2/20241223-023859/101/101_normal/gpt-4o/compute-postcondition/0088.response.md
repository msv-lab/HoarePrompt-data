The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`, and `bottom` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`**
