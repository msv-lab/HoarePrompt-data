According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `left`, and `right`. If `j` is less than `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `left + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `left + 2`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `i` is `top + 1`, and `j` is `left + 2`.**
