Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` is 2 and `top` is 2, otherwise, there is no change in the state as the else part does not exist***
