Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. If `top` is None, then `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 1, and `right` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `left` is 1, and the values of `right`, `top`, and `bottom` are updated based on the values of `j` and `i`: if `j` > `right`, then `right` is `j`; if `j` < `left`, then `j` is 1; if `i` < `top`, the condition is either true or false; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
