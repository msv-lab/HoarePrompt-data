The value of `bottom` is updated to be equal to the current value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is 0, `bottom` becomes 0. The condition `if i < top, then the current value of top is 0` is still valid, so `top` is 0. The current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom` is no longer true, since `i` and `bottom` are now equal.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None**.
