The code snippet assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given the initial state, we know that `j` is 1. Therefore, `left` and `right` are both assigned the value 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
