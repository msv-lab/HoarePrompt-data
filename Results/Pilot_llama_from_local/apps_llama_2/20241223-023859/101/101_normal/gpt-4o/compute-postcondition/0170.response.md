To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and loop code step by step.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**: The loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right + 1`. For each iteration, it checks if the current position (`i`, `j`) is on the border of the bounding box defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. If it is, and the character at that position in `result` is '.', it updates the character to '+'.

2. **Output State After Iterations**: 
   - The loop updates `result` based on the conditions related to the borders of the bounding box.
   - The variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` do not change within the loop as there are no update statements for these variables within the loop.

3. **Border Conditions and Updates**:
   - For any position (`i`, `j`) that is on the border (i.e., `i` equals `top` or `bottom`, or `j` equals `left` or `right`), if the character at `result[i][j]` is '.', it will be updated to '+'.
   - Positions not on the border or already containing 'w' or '+' will remain unchanged.

4. **Final State**:
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `screen` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop; `result` is the modified copy.
   - `i` and `j` will have moved through their respective ranges but their final values after the loop are determined by the last iteration, which for `j` is `right` since it iterates up to `right + 1`. `i` is not updated within this specific loop but is part of the initial condition.
   - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` are constants within the context of this loop as they define the bounding box and its dimensions.
   - `result` will be the modified version of `screen`, where all '.' characters on the border of the bounding box have been replaced with '+', and all other characters remain unchanged.

Given these observations, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a copy of `screen` where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.**
