The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is 0, `left` and `right` are both assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is 2, `bottom` is 2, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**
