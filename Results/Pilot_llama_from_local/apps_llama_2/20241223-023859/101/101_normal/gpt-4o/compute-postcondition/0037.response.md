The code assigns the value of `j` to `left` and `right`. The previous value of `j` is 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m > 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m > 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 2, `right` is 2**
