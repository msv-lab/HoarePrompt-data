Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', if `i` > `bottom`, then the current value of `top` is 0, the current value of `bottom` is 0, if `j` < `left`, then the current value of `left` is 0, `right` is None, otherwise, the values of `left` and `right` are unchanged. The current value of `j` is greater than the current value of `right`.**
