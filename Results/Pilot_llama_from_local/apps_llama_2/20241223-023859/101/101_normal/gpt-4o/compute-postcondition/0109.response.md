Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` is greater than `bottom`, `n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, `top`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains as in the precondition since there's no else part to modify it, and given that `i` equals `bottom` (both are 2) in this context, the condition `i > bottom` will be false.**
