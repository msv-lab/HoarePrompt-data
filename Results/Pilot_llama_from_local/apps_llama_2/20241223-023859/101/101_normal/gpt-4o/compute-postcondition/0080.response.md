Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `left` is 1, if `j` > `right`, then `right` is `j`, if `j` < `left`, then `j` is 1, if `i` < `top`, then the condition is either true or false, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1, otherwise, the state remains unchanged**
