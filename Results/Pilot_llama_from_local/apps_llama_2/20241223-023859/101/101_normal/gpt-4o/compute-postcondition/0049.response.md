According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is `m-1`, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` are either `None` (if no 'w' characters are found in the first row of `screen`) or they represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`**
