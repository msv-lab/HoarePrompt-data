The code assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. Since `j` equals 1, `left` will also be equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `bottom` equals 2, and `left` equals 1**
