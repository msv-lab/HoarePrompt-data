According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the given state already ensures that `left` and `right` are valid and `left` is less than or equal to `right` because `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed, `j` should be equal to `left` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `top`, `j` is `left`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`, representing the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen`**
