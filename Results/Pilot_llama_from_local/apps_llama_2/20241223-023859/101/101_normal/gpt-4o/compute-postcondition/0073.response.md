The given code assigns the value of `i` to `top`. The value of `i` is 1, so `top` is also 1. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1**
