The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The value of `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 2, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `top` is 0, and `right` is 2.
