Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, then `i` is 2, `top` is 2, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`. Otherwise, the state remains as in the precondition since there's no else part to modify it. However, given that `i` is initially 2 and `top` is not `None` with at least one 'w' character in the first row, and since `i` equals `top` (both are 2) in this context, the condition `i < top` will be false. Therefore, the overall postcondition essentially retains the initial state described in the precondition.***
