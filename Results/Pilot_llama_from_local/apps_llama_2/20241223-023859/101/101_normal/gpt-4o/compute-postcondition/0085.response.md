The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` are not changed. 
The value of `left` and `right` is now equal to `j`, which is the next index in the range of `m`. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`**
