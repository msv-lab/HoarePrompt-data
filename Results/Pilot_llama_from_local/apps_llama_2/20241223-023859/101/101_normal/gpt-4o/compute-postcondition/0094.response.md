Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 < m <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `j` is the next index in the range of `m`. If `top` is None, then `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is equal to `j`; if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`; if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`; and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
