The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given that `i` equals 2, `bottom` is assigned the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 < `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `bottom` equals 2, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `i` is 2 and `top` is 2**
