Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `i` is `top + 1`, and `j` is `left + 1`. If `i` is equal to `top` or `i` is equal to `bottom` or `j` is equal to `left` or `j` is equal to `right`, then `result[i][j]` is '+' if its original value was '.'; otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
