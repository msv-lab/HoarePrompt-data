According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `top`, and `bottom`. If `i` is less than `bottom`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified but we know that `top` and `bottom` define the range of the loop. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 

Since `i` must be in the range `[top, bottom]`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be `top + 1` if the loop is to execute again for the first time, and then increased by 1 for each subsequent iteration. Given that `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, we know that `bottom` is at least `top + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than or equal to `bottom`, so `i` should be in the range `[top + 1, bottom]`. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be `top + 1` to execute the loop body for the first time, and then it will continue until `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a 2D list where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', and other characters remain unchanged, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `top + 1`**
