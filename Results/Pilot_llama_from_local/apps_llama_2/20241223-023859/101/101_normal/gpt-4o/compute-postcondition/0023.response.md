The given code snippet assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. 

The value of `i` is 0, so `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 2000 and m must be greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0**
