To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
    for j in range(left, right + 1):
        if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
            if result[i][j] == '.':
                result[i][j] = '+'
```
This code iterates over all characters in the `result` 2D list within the bounding box defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`. For characters on the borders of this box (i.e., where `i` equals `top` or `bottom`, or `j` equals `left` or `right`), if the character is a dot (`'.'`), it replaces the dot with a plus (`'+'`).

Given this, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, as the loop does not modify `n`.
- `m` remains an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, as the loop does not modify `m`.
- `screen` remains a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', as the loop does not modify `screen`.
- `result` will be a modified version of `screen` where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+'.
- `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, as the loop does not modify these variables.
- `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, as the loop does not modify `frame_height`.
- `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, as the loop does not modify `frame_width`.
- `i` and `j` are loop counters and will take on the values of the range they are iterating over during the execution of the loop, but their final values after the loop completes are not directly relevant to the output state description, as the loop's effects are cumulative on the `result`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a modified 2D list where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, and `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.**
