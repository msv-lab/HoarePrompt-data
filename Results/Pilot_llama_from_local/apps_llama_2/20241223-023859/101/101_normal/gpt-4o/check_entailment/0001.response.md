Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One case that the program does not handle correctly is when there are white pixels that are not part of a square frame of size 1 pixel width. The program should check if all white pixels are on the frame, but it only checks if the frame can be formed with the given white pixels.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```
The program should output -1 because there is no square frame that can include all white pixels and have a size of 1 pixel width. However, the program will output a frame that includes some of the white pixels but not all.

In this example, the program does not correctly check if all white pixels are part of the frame, which is a requirement of the problem description. This means the program is not correct for all potential cases. 

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle this case and ensure that all white pixels are part of the frame. 

This could be done by checking if there are any white pixels that are not part of the frame after the frame is constructed. If such pixels exist, the program should output -1. 

Therefore, the given program is not correct.
