Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description says for every potential case. 

One of the main requirements in the problem description is to find the smallest square frame that can enclose all white pixels. However, the given program simply takes the bounding box of all the white pixels and converts the border pixels to '+'. This does not guarantee that the resulting frame is a square or that it is the smallest possible square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 6
......
.w....
......
..w...
......
```
The program will output:
```
......
+w+...
+.+...
++w...
......
```
However, the smallest square frame that can enclose all white pixels is:
```
......
+w+...
+.+...
+.+...
......
```
As we can see, the program does not always produce the correct output.

Another issue is that the program does not check if the frame is indeed a square. If the bounding box of the white pixels is not a square, the program should return -1, but instead, it will still output the modified frame.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and is incorrect.
