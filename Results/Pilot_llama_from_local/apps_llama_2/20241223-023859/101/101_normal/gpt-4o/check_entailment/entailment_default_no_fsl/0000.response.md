Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the code does not correctly handle the case when the 'w' characters do not form a square frame. According to the problem description, the required frame must have the smallest size, but the code does not check if the bounding box of the 'w' characters is a square.

For example, if the input is:

```
4 5
w.....
.....
.....
.....w
```

The code will return a result with a height of 4 and a width of 5, which is not a square frame. The correct output should be -1, because there is no possible square frame that satisfies the conditions.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle the case when the 'w' characters are not located on the borders of the bounding box. According to the problem description, all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame, but the code does not check if there are any 'w' characters inside the bounding box.

These cases are not handled correctly by the code, and therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
