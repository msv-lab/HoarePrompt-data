Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. One case where it fails is when the bounding box of the 'w' characters has a height or width of less than 2, but the box itself is not a square (i.e., its height and width are not equal). In this case, the program returns -1, but according to the problem description, it should still try to find a possible square frame that satisfies the conditions.

For example, if the input is:
```
5 6
......
.w....
......
..w...
......
```
The program will return -1 because the bounding box of the 'w' characters has a height of 3 and a width of 4, which is not a square. However, according to the problem description, the program should still try to find a possible square frame that satisfies the conditions. In this case, the program should return:
```
......
+w+...
+.+...
++w...
......
```
Another case where the program fails is when there are multiple possible frames with the same minimum size. In this case, the program should return any of them, but the current implementation only returns the first one it finds.

Overall, the program does not fully follow the problem description and may not work correctly for all possible inputs. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the program so that it can handle cases where the bounding box of the 'w' characters is not a square and can find the smallest possible square frame that satisfies the conditions. 

Here is a high-level description of how we can modify the program to fix this issue:
- First, we need to find the bounding box of the 'w' characters and its minimum size.
- Then, we need to check if we can find a square frame with the minimum size that satisfies the conditions.
- If we can find such a frame, we need to return it. If not, we need to try to find a larger square frame that satisfies the conditions.
- We need to continue this process until we find a square frame that satisfies the conditions or we are sure that no such frame exists. 

By making these modifications, we can ensure that the program fully follows the problem description and works correctly for all possible inputs.
