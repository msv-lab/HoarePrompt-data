Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. 

One of the main issues with the code is that it doesn't check if all white pixels are located on the frame. It simply replaces the '.' characters on the borders of the bounding box of all 'w' characters with '+'. This means that if there are any 'w' characters that are not on the border of the bounding box, the code will still produce an output, even though the problem description states that all white pixels must be located on the frame.

Another issue with the code is that it doesn't find the smallest possible frame. It simply finds the bounding box of all 'w' characters and replaces the '.' characters on its borders with '+'. However, the problem description states that of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size.

The code also doesn't handle cases where the required frame does not exist. For example, if the 'w' characters are not in a square or rectangle shape, or if they are not contiguous, the code will still produce an output, even though the problem description states that if the required frame does not exist, then print a single line containing number -1. 

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to check if all white pixels are located on the frame, find the smallest possible frame, and handle cases where the required frame does not exist. 

For instance, in the case where the input is:

```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```

The output should be -1, because there is no square frame with a width of 1 pixel that contains all the white pixels. However, the code will produce an incorrect output. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
