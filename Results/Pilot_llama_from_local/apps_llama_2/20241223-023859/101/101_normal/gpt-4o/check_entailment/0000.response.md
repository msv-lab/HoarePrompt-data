Correctness: **False**.

The provided code does not work correctly in all cases. It calculates the frame size based on the positions of the white pixels, but it does not check if the calculated frame satisfies the condition that all white pixels are located on the frame.

For example, if the input is:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```
The code will return a frame of size 4, but the white pixels are not all located on the frame. The correct output for this case should be -1, indicating that there is no possible frame that satisfies the conditions.

The issue with the code is that it does not verify if the calculated frame includes all white pixels and if the white pixels are part of the frame. It only checks if the frame size is at least 2x2, but it does not ensure that the frame is correct.

To fix this issue, the code should check all possible frames and verify if they satisfy the conditions. This could be done by iterating over all possible frame sizes and checking if the frame includes all white pixels and if all white pixels are part of the frame. If no such frame is found, the code should return -1. 

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the frame size is not a square, it assumes that the frame is always a square, but the problem statement does not guarantee this. 

The given solution does not find the smallest possible square frame, it just finds a frame that includes all white pixels, but it does not ensure that this frame is the smallest possible. 

The given code has several logical errors and needs to be revised to correctly solve the problem.
