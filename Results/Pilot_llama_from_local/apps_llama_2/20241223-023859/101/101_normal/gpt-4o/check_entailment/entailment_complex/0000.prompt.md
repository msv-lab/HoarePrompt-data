You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, m, screen)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    for row in result:
        print(''.join(row))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2000 and 1 <= m <= 2000, and screen is a 2D list of strings where each string has length m and consists of characters '.' and 'w', representing the state of the monitor pixels.
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `i` is `n-1`, `j` is `m-1`, and `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, or are `None` if no 'w' characters are found.
    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1

    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if (frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2) :
        return -1

The `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and the `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 2000, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 2000, `screen` is a 2D list of strings where each string has length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w', `result` is a modified 2D list where all '.' characters on the borders defined by `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` have been replaced with '+', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None` and represent the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen`, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, and `frame_width` is `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2.
    return result
    #The program returns the modified 2D list 'result' where all '.' characters on the borders defined by 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' have been replaced with '+'. The 'result' is based on the 'screen' which is a 2D list of strings with length 'm' and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. The 'top', 'bottom', 'left', and 'right' are the bounding box of all 'w' characters in 'screen', with 'frame_height' being 'bottom - top + 1' and 'frame_width' being 'right - left + 1', both of which are greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `screen`, where `n` and `m` are integers representing the dimensions of the 2D list `screen`, and `screen` is a 2D list of strings with length `m` and consists of characters '.' and 'w'. The function returns either -1 or the modified 2D list where '.' characters on the borders of the bounding box of all 'w' characters in `screen` have been replaced with '+'. The function first checks if there are any 'w' characters in the `screen`. If not, or if the bounding box of the 'w' characters has a height or width less than 2, it returns -1. If the 'w' characters form a valid bounding box with a height and width of at least 2, it creates a copy of the `screen`, replaces the '.' characters on the borders of the bounding box with '+', and returns this modified 2D list. The function handles edge cases where the 'w' characters may be located at the edges of the `screen`, and it correctly calculates the bounding box and modifies the borders accordingly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
