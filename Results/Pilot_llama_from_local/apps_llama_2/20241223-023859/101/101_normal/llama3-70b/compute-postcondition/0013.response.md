The loop iterates over the list of white pixels, updating the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates at each step.

After all iterations of the loop, `min_x` will be the minimum x-coordinate of all white pixels, and `min_y` will be the minimum y-coordinate of all white pixels. Similarly, `max_x` will be the maximum x-coordinate of all white pixels, and `max_y` will be the maximum y-coordinate of all white pixels.

Since the loop iterates over all white pixels, the output state will be independent of the order of the pixels in the `white_pixels` list.

If the `white_pixels` list is empty (i.e., there are no white pixels), the loop will not execute, and `min_x` and `min_y` will remain `float('inf')`, while `max_x` and `max_y` will remain `float('-inf')`.

However, we are given that there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list. Therefore, `white_pixels` is not empty, and the loop will execute at least once.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels**
