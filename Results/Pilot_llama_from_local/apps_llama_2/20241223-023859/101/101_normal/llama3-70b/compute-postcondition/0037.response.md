The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no loop provided in the given code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger loop structure. 

The values of the variables do not change, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
