The code snippet only contains a print statement with the value -1. This does not modify any of the existing variables. The print statement simply outputs the value -1 to the console, which means that the value -1 has been returned at the output state. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, the current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the value -1 has been returned at the output state.**
