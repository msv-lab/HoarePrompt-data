To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop statement and the current state. The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the current state: 
- `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1,
- `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`,
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the row `i = 1` has been modified according to the border conditions,
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w',
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 2. Other variables like `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` do not change because they are not modified by the loop iteration. `j`'s value is not directly affected by the loop condition but since it represents the column index after the last iteration over columns for the current row `i`, it will reset to 0 at the start of the next iteration for the next row.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 2, `j` is 0**.
