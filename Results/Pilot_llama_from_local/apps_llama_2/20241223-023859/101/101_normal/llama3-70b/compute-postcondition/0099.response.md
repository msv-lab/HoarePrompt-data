The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters `n` and `m`, but rather relies on the input being provided in a specific format. However, based on the parameter constraints, we can infer that the function accepts a pair of integers `n` and `m` as the resolution of the monitor, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, representing the pixels of the monitor.

To accurately describe the function's parameters, let's consider the input as a whole: the function accepts the resolution of the monitor (`n` and `m`) and the pixel data (`n` lines of `m` characters each).

Unfortunately, the problem statement does not specify the output of the function. Therefore, I will provide a general description of the function's functionality based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts the resolution of the monitor (n and m) and the corresponding pixel data (n lines of m characters each), where each character represents either a black pixel (.) or a white pixel (w), and returns an unspecified output based on this input.**
