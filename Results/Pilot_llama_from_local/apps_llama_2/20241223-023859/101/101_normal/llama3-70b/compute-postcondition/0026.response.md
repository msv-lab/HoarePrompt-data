The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '.'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `pixels[i][j]` was not equal to 'w' before the update, and now it is '.', the list of 'w' pixels (`white_pixels`) does not include the pixel at `(i, j)`, and the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the 'w' pixels (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`) remain the same. Therefore, `frame_size` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0**
