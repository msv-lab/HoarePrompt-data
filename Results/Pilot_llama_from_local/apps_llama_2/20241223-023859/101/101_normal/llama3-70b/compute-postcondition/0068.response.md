Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size. The current values of `i` and `j` are 2 and 0 respectively. Either the current value of `i` is equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, or the current value of `j` is equal to `min_y` or `max_y`. The pixel at position `(i, j)` in `pixels` has a value of '.'**
