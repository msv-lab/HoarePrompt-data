The given code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of a pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` 2D list to `'.'`. 

Since `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`, `j` is less than `m`. Also, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, but `j` itself is not directly constrained by this, other than being less than `m`. 

However, there is no specific information about `i` in relation to `n`, except that `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`. Therefore, `i` must be within the range of `0` to `n-1` to be a valid index for `pixels`. 

Given that at least one 'w' pixel exists, and `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on the 'w' pixels, changing a pixel to `'.'` does not affect these minimum and maximum coordinates unless the changed pixel was one of the 'w' pixels that defined these boundaries. However, without specific information about the position `(i, j)` relative to the 'w' pixels, we cannot determine if `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, or `max_y` would change. 

If `(i, j)` was a 'w' pixel, its change to `'.'` could potentially affect `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and consequently `frame_size`, if `(i, j)` was at one of the boundaries of the 'w' pixels. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`, `white_pixels` may have been updated if `(i, j)` was a 'w' pixel, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` may have changed if `(i, j)` was at a boundary, `frame_size` may have changed if the boundaries changed, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, `white_pixels` may have been updated, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` may have changed, `frame_size` may have changed, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`**
