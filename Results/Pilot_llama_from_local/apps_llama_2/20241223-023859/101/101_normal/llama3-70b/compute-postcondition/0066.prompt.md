You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and loop code.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D list `pixels` of size `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - For each position `(i, j)` in `pixels`, it checks if the current position is on the border (i.e., `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`) and if the pixel at that position is `'.'`. If both conditions are true, it marks the pixel as `'+'`.
   - If the pixel is `'w'`, it skips to the next iteration without changing the pixel's value.
   - If the pixel is neither on the border nor `'w'`, it ensures the pixel remains `'.'`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - Given that the loop iterates over each column `j` in `pixels` for a fixed row `i = 1`, we can infer that the loop will execute `m` times, where `m` is the number of columns in `pixels`.
   - After all iterations, `i` remains 1 because the loop does not modify `i`; it only iterates over `j`.
   - `j` will be `m` after the loop finishes because the loop iterates `m` times, and the last iteration will be for `j = m - 1` (since indexing starts at 0), but after the loop ends, `j` will be incremented one last time, making it equal to `m`.
   - The state of `pixels` will have been modified according to the border conditions for the row `i = 1`. Specifically, any pixel at position `(1, j)` that was originally `'.'` and was on the border (as defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) will have been changed to `'+'`. All other pixels in the row `i = 1` that were `'w'` will remain `'w'`, and those that were not on the border will remain `'.'`.
   - `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` will retain their original values because the loop does not modify these variables.
   - `n` and `m` will retain their original values as well since the loop does not modify them.

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - If the list `pixels` is empty (which would mean `m = 0`), the loop would not execute, and all variables would retain their initial values.
   - The loop's execution and modifications to `pixels` are contingent upon the original values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and the content of `pixels` itself.

**Output State**: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the row `i = 1` has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 1, `j` is `m`.**
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
