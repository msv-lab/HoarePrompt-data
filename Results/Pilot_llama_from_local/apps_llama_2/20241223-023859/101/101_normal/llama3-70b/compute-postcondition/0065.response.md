To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and loop code.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D list `pixels` of size `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - For each position `(i, j)` in `pixels`, it checks if the current position is on the border (i.e., `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`) and if the pixel at that position is `'.'`. If both conditions are true, it marks the pixel as `'+'`.
   - If the pixel is `'w'`, it skips to the next iteration without changing the pixel's value.
   - If the pixel is neither on the border nor `'w'`, it ensures the pixel remains `'.'`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - Given that the loop iterates over each column `j` in `pixels` for a fixed row `i = 1`, we can infer that the loop will execute `m` times, where `m` is the number of columns in `pixels`.
   - After all iterations, `i` remains 1 because the loop does not modify `i`; it only iterates over `j`.
   - `j` will be `m` after the loop finishes because the loop iterates `m` times, and the last iteration will be for `j = m - 1` (since indexing starts at 0), but after the loop ends, `j` will be incremented one last time, making it equal to `m`.
   - The state of `pixels` will have been modified according to the border conditions for the row `i = 1`. Specifically, any pixel at position `(1, j)` that was originally `'.'` and was on the border (as defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) will have been changed to `'+'`. All other pixels in the row `i = 1` that were `'w'` will remain `'w'`, and those that were not on the border will remain `'.'`.
   - `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` will retain their original values because the loop does not modify these variables.
   - `n` and `m` will retain their original values as well since the loop does not modify them.

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - If the list `pixels` is empty (which would mean `m = 0`), the loop would not execute, and all variables would retain their initial values.
   - The loop's execution and modifications to `pixels` are contingent upon the original values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and the content of `pixels` itself.

**Output State**: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the row `i = 1` has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 1, `j` is `m`.**
