The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` updates the value of `pixels` at the position `(i, j)` to '.'. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to 'w' and it is either not on the border or not equal to '.'. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are not changed. The values of `i` and `j` are also not changed.

The updated `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '.' and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and it is not the case that ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'), which means either (`i` is not equal to `min_x` and `i` is not equal to `max_x` and `j` is not equal to `min_y` and `j` is not equal to `max_y`) or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.'), and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to '.'**
