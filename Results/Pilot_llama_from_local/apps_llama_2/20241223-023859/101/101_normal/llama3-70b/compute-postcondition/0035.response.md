According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`, so `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`**
