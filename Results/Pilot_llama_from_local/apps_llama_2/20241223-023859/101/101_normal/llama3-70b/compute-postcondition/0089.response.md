To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's break down the loop's operation and the conditions it checks.

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `m`. This implies that the loop will execute `m` times, given that `m` is the number of columns in the `pixels` 2D list.

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j] = '+'`. This condition essentially checks if the current pixel is on the border of the frame and if it's not white (`'w'`). If both conditions are true, it marks the pixel as a border pixel (`'+'`).
   - If `pixels[i][j] == 'w'`, the loop skips to the next iteration, effectively ignoring white pixels.
   - For any other case (not on the border or not white), `pixels[i][j] = '.'`. This means any pixel not on the border or not explicitly set to `'w'` will be set to `'.'`.

3. **Variables' State After Loop Execution**:
   - `n` remains unchanged as it's not modified within the loop.
   - `m` also remains unchanged because it's the loop's range parameter.
   - `pixels`: Each pixel in the row `i` (which is 2 in the initial state) will be either `'+'` if it's on the border and not white, `'w'` if it was initially white, or `'.'` if it's not on the border and not white.
   - `white_pixels` does not change within the loop provided, so its state remains as a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals `'w'`.
   - `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size and do not change within this loop.
   - `i` starts at 2 and does not change within the loop. It's an external condition that determines the row being processed.
   - `j` iterates over the range of `m` and will end at `m-1` after the loop completes.

Given these observations, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed for all iterations can be summarized as follows:

- `n`, `m`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` retain their original values as they are not modified within the loop.
- `pixels[2][j]` (for all `j` in the range of `m`) will be `'+'` if the pixel is on the border and not initially white, `'w'` if it was white, and `'.'` otherwise.
- `white_pixels` remains a list of tuples representing the positions of white pixels.
- `i` remains 2, as per the initial state and the context of the loop.
- `j` ends at `m-1`, indicating the loop has iterated over all columns.

**Output State:** **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[2][j]` equals `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[2][j]` is not `'w'`, equals `'w'` if initially `'w'`, and equals `'.'` otherwise, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals `'w'`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, and `j` equals `m-1`.**
