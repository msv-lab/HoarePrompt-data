Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that either `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is '.'**
