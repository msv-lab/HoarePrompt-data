The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, `pixels[1][1]` is now `'.'`. The rest of the 2D list `pixels` remains unchanged except for the first row which was previously modified according to the border conditions. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[1][1]` equals `'.'` and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
