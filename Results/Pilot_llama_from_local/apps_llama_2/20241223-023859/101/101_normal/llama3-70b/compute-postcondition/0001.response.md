The code snippet provided is executed to store the input lines of characters into a 2D list called `pixels`. 

Each character in the input lines is either "." (representing a black pixel) or "w" (representing a white pixel). The number of lines and the number of characters in each line are given by the integers `n` and `m`, respectively.

After executing the code, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[i][j]` stores the character at the `i-th` line and `j-th` position.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing "." or "w" characters, there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list.**
