The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given code, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop**
