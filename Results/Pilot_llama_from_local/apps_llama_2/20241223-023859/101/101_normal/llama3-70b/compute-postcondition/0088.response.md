Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', then `pixels[2][2]` equals '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][2]` equals 'w', the program skips to the next iteration of the surrounding loop, otherwise `pixels[2][2]` equals '.'**
