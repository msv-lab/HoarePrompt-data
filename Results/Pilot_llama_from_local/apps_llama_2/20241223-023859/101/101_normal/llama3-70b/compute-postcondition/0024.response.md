The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, it will skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration. 

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, and it is given that `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the continue statement will cause the loop to move on to the next iteration. 

However, the values of the variables are not changed by the `continue` statement itself. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
