To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and loop code.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each row `i` in the 2D list `pixels` of size `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000 (inclusive).
   - For each position `(i, j)` in `pixels`, it checks if the current position is on the border (i.e., `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`) and if the pixel at that position is `'.'`. If both conditions are true, it marks the pixel as `'+'`.
   - If the pixel is `'w'`, it skips to the next iteration without changing the pixel's value.
   - If the pixel is neither on the border nor `'w'`, it ensures the pixel remains `'.'`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - Given that the loop iterates over each row `i` and column `j` in `pixels`, we can infer that the loop will execute `n * m` times.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `n` because the loop iterates `n` times over the rows, and `j` will be `m` after the loop finishes because the inner loop iterates `m` times over the columns.
   - The state of `pixels` will have been modified according to the border conditions for all rows and columns. Specifically, any pixel at position `(i, j)` that was originally `'.'` and was on the border (as defined by the original `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) will have been changed to `'+'`. All other pixels that were `'w'` will remain `'w'`, and those that were not on the border will remain `'.'`.
   - `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` will retain their original values because the loop does not modify these variables. Note that these variables reflect the original distribution and dimensions of the `'w'` pixels before any modifications made by the loop.
   - `n` and `m` will retain their original values as well since the loop does not modify them.

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - If the list `pixels` is empty (which would mean `n = 0` or `m = 0`), the loop would not execute, and all variables would retain their initial values.
   - The loop's execution and modifications to `pixels` are contingent upon the original values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and the content of `pixels` itself.

Considering the loop iterates over all rows and columns, the final state of `pixels` will reflect the border conditions applied to all positions, and the other variables will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions (as defined by the original `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `m`.**
