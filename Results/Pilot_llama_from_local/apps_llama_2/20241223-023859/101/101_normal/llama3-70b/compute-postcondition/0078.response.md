The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns a '+' to the element at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` 2D list. 

Given the initial state, `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 1. The value of `pixels[2][1]` is updated to '+'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, 
`m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[2][1]` equals '+', 
`white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', 
`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, 
`i` equals 2, 
`j` equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[2][1]` equals '+', `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1**
