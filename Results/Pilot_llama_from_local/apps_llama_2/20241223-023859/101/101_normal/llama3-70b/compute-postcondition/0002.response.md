The given code snippet is a list comprehension that iterates over each pixel in the `pixels` 2D list and checks if the pixel is 'w'. If it is, the coordinates of the pixel are added to the `white_pixels` list. 

So, `white_pixels` is assigned a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the coordinates (i, j) of a 'w' pixel in the `pixels` 2D list.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `pixels`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing "." or "w" characters, there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of all 'w' pixels in `pixels`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing "." or "w" characters, there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w'**
