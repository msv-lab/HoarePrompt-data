The given code changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to '+'. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is '.'. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code.

Since the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is '.' and it is changed to '+', and `i` equals either `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` equals either `min_y` or `max_y`, the new state of `pixels` will have '+' at position `(i, j)` which is at the border.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '+' and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current values of `i` and `j` are such that either `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '+' and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current values of `i` and `j` are such that either `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`.**
