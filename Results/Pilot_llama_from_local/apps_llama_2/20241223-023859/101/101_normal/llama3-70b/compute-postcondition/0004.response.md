To execute the given for loop, we need to consider the variables involved and their initial states. The loop iterates over each tuple in the `white_pixels` list, where each tuple contains the coordinates (x, y) of a 'w' pixel in the `pixels` 2D list.

Given the initial states:
- `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, indicating the dimensions of the `pixels` 2D list.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing "." or "w" characters.
- There is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list.
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w'.
- `min_x` equals `float('inf')`.
- `min_y` equals `float('inf')`.
- `max_x` equals `float('-inf')`.
- `max_y` equals `float('-inf')`.

For the loop to execute, it's crucial that `white_pixels` is not empty since it directly influences the loop's execution. Given that there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list, it implies that `white_pixels` must have at least one tuple representing the coordinates of a 'w' pixel.

The initial values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are set to positive infinity and negative infinity, respectively, suggesting they are intended to track the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the 'w' pixels encountered during the loop's execution.

Therefore, at the start of the loop:
- `n` and `m` maintain their initial values as integers between 1 and 2000.
- `pixels` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel.
- `white_pixels` must have at least one tuple (x, y) corresponding to a 'w' pixel in `pixels`.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are set to track the minimum and maximum coordinates but do not directly affect the loop's execution; their initial values are Extreme and will be updated as the loop progresses.
- The loop variable `(x, y)` is about to take the value of the first tuple in `white_pixels`, indicating the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel to be processed.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a non-empty list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` equals `float('inf')`, `min_y` equals `float('inf')`, `max_x` equals `float('-inf')`, `max_y` equals `float('-inf')`, and `(x, y)` is about to take the value of the first 'w' pixel's coordinates in `white_pixels`**
