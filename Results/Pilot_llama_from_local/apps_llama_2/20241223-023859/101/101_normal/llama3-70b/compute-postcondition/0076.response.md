Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 0, and either `pixels[2][0]` equals '+' if `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x`, or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', or the program state remains unchanged if `pixels[i][j]` does not equal '.' or `i` is not equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, and `j` is not equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, unless `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w' in which case the loop iteration is skipped.**
