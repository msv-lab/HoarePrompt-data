`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are assigned the values `float('inf')`, `float('inf')`, `float('-inf')`, `float('-inf')` respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing "." or "w" characters, there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', `min_x` equals `float('inf')`, `min_y` equals `float('inf')`, `max_x` equals `float('-inf')`, `max_y` equals `float('-inf')`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing "." or "w" characters, there is at least one "w" pixel in the `pixels` 2D list, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', `min_x` equals `float('inf')`, `min_y` equals `float('inf')`, `max_x` equals `float('-inf')`, `max_y` equals `float('-inf')`**
