Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[1][1]` equals `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][1]` equals `'w'`, the loop moves to the next iteration, otherwise `pixels[1][1]` equals `'.'`. `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 1, `j` is 1***
