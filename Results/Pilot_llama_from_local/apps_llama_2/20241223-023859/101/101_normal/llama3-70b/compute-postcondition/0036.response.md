The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value '+' to the element at position `[i][j]` in the 2D list `pixels`. 

Since `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, and `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`, the value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`, and `i` is an integer where `1 ≤ i ≤ n` since it's used as an index for the 2D list `pixels`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`**
