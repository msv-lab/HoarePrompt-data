Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the loop continues to the next iteration with `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` unchanged. If `pixels[i][j]` does not equal 'w' and `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` is False, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` may have been updated. At least one 'w' pixel exists in `pixels`.**
