To calculate the result, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Given the code: 
```
min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
```
The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` by taking the minimum of their current values and the coordinates `x` and `y` of the second 'w' pixel.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 2 elements
- `min_x` equals the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel
- `min_y` equals the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel
- `max_x` equals the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel
- `max_y` equals the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel
- `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the second 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`

The code does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `max_x`, and `max_y`. It only updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and the coordinates `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 2 elements
- `min_x` equals the minimum of the x-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels
- `min_y` equals the minimum of the y-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels
- `max_x` equals the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel
- `max_y` equals the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel
- `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the second 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 2 elements, `min_x` equals the minimum of the x-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels, `min_y` equals the minimum of the y-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels, `max_x` equals the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel, `max_y` equals the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel, `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the second 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`**
