The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to '+'. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is not specified, and the update only affects the value at the specific position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` 2D list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` equals '+' and at least one 'w' pixel exists, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`**
