The `print` statement is executed with the argument `''.join(row)`, where `row` is the first row in `pixels`. This means the first row of `pixels` is printed as a string. The values of the variables do not change, but the first row of `pixels` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `row` is the first row in `pixels`, and the first row of `pixels` has been printed**
