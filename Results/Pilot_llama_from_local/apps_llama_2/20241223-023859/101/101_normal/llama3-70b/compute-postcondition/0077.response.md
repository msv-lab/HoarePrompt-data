According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `m`, so `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1**
