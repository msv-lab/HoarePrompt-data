Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`. If `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop, with `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` unchanged. If `pixels[i][j]` does not equal 'w', `pixels[i][j]` is '.', `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` may have been updated.**
