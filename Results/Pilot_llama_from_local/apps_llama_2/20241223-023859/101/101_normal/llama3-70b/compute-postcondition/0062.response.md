The given code snippet changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, and `j`. 

The code only affects the `pixels` 2D list. The value of `pixels` at the position `(i, j)` is changed to `'.'`. 

Other variables are not affected, so their values remain the same: 
- `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, 
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', 
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, 
- `i` is 1, 
- `j` is 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[1][2]` equals `'.'` and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, 
`white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', 
`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[1][2]` equals `'.'` and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
