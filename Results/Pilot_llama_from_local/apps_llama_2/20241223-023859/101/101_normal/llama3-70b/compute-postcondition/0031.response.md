The `continue` statement does not change any variable values, but it skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
