Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y` and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.', which means either `i` is not equal to `min_x` and not equal to `max_x` and not equal to `min_x` or `j` is not equal to `min_y` and not equal to `max_y`, or `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to '.'. Furthermore, `pixels[i][j]` is not equal to 'w'.**
