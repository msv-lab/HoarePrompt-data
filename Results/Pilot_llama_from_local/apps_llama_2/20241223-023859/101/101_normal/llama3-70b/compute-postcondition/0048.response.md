The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but the current iteration is skipped. 

The value of `n` is still an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is still a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is still a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` still reflect the original frame size, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 0, and the condition that ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.') is still not met, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is still 'w'. We move to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the condition that ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.') is not met, the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
