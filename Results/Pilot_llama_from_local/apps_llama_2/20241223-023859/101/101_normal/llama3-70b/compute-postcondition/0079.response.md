The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not provided with any loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will raise a `SyntaxError` because it is not inside a loop. However, assuming it is part of a larger loop that is not shown here, the `continue` statement would skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.

Given the initial state and considering the `continue` statement is part of a loop, the values of the variables do not change because the `continue` statement does not modify variables; it only controls the flow of the loop. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
