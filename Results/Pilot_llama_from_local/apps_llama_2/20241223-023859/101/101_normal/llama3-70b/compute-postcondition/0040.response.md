Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'`, then `pixels[i][j]` remains `'.'`, and if `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the loop skips to the next iteration.***
