To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and understand how it affects the variables.

The loop code is:
```python
for row in pixels:
    print(''.join(row))
```
This loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` 2D list and prints the row as a string.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

* The value of `i` increases by 1 after each iteration, starting from 0.
* The value of `j` remains 0 throughout the iterations.
* The `row` variable takes the value of the current row being printed in each iteration.
* The number of rows printed increases by 1 after each iteration.

Based on these patterns, we can infer the following:

* After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, since it starts from 0 and increases by 1 after each iteration.
* `j` will remain 0, as it does not change throughout the iterations.
* The `row` variable will take the value of the last row in `pixels` after the final iteration.
* All rows in `pixels` will have been printed.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size`) do not change their values during the loop execution, as they are not modified by the loop code.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 0, `row` is the last row in `pixels`, and all rows in `pixels` have been printed.**
