The input consists of a pair of integers `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, representing the resolution of the monitor. The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `n` and `m` based on the input. 

Previous values of `n` and `m` are not defined, but after this line, `n` and `m` will be integers representing the number of lines and characters per line of the monitor's resolution.

The states of other variables are not affected, as there are no other defined variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, representing the resolution of the monitor, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either "." (period, ASCII code 46) representing a black pixel or "w" (lowercase English letter w) representing a white pixel, and there is at least one "w" pixel.**
