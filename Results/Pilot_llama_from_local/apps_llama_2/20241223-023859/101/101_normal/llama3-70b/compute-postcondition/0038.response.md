The given Python code snippet is executed based on the provided initial state. The code changes the value of `pixels` at position `[i][j]` to `'.'`. 

`n` is still an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, 
`m` is still an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, 
`pixels` is still a 2D list of size `n x m` but `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`, 
`j` is still `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`, 
and `i` is not specified in the initial state, so its value remains unknown.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, `j` is `k + 2` where `k + 2` is less than `m`**
