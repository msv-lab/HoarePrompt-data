According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
