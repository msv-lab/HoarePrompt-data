The code calculates the `frame_size` as the maximum of the difference between `max_x` and `min_x` and the difference between `max_y` and `min_y`, plus 1. 

Since `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, and `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, the value of `frame_size` is equal to the maximum of the width and height of the bounding box of the 'w' pixels plus 1.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`**
