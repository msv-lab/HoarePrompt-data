The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` by taking the maximum of their current values and the new `x` and `y` coordinates, respectively. 

The updated `max_x` becomes the maximum of the previous `max_x`, `x`, and the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels (initial `max_x`). 
The updated `max_y` becomes the maximum of the previous `max_y`, `y`, and the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels (initial `max_y`).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 3 elements, `min_x` is the minimum of the previous `min_x` and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of the previous `min_y` and `y`, `max_x` equals the maximum of `max_x`, `x`, and the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels, `max_y` equals the maximum of `max_y`, `y`, and the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels**
