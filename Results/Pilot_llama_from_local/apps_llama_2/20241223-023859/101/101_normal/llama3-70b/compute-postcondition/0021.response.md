The code changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to '+'. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` was '.'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is still an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is still a 2D list of size `n x m` but now with `pixels[i][j]` equals '+', `white_pixels` is still a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is still the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is still the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is still the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is still the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is still `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is still less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, the current value of `i` is still either equal to `min_x` or `max_x`, and the current value of `j` is still either equal to `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` now equals '+'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel and `pixels[i][j]` equals '+', `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is either `min_x` or `max_x`, `j` is either `min_y` or `max_y`, and `pixels[i][j]` equals '+'**.
