To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of `m`. For this loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0, because `range(m)` needs to have at least one value to iterate over.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`
- `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w'
- `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels
- `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels
- `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels
- `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels
- `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`
- `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`
- `i` is 0

Since `m` is already defined to be between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), the condition for `m` to be greater than 0 is inherently satisfied. Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the state of `m` beyond what is already given.

However, to align with the format and ensure clarity, we acknowledge that `j` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop (as it is the first value in `range(m)`), and all other variables maintain their defined states.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0**
