To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates over each column `j` in the `pixels` 2D list. For each cell `(i, j)`, it checks three conditions:
1. If the cell is on the border of the frame defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`, and the cell's value is '.', it marks the cell as '+'.
2. If the cell's value is 'w', it skips to the next iteration.
3. If neither condition is met, it ensures the cell's value remains '.'.

Given that `i` is 0 and does not change within the loop, the loop essentially processes the first row of the `pixels` 2D list.

After all iterations, the state of the variables can be summarized as follows:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged for the same reason.
- `pixels` will have its first row (`i = 0`) modified according to the rules:
  - Cells on the border of the frame and with a value of '.' will be marked as '+'.
  - Cells with a value of 'w' will be skipped, meaning their value remains 'w'.
  - Other cells will ensure their value remains '.'.
- `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are not updated within the loop provided, so their values remain as they were initially set, reflecting the original distribution of 'w' pixels before the loop's execution.
- `i` remains 0, as it is not incremented or changed within the loop.

Considering the constraints and the loop's behavior:
- The loop will execute at least once if `m` is greater than 0.
- The loop does not execute if `m` is 0, in which case `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' reflecting the original 'w' pixel distribution, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, and `i` is 0.**
