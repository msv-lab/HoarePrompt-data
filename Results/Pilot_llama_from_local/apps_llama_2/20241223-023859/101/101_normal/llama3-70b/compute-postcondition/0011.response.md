To understand the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables.

The given code is:
```python
min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)
```
This line of code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` by comparing their current values with `x` and `y` respectively and assigning the minimum of the two values to `min_x` and `min_y`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 3 elements
- `min_x` equals the minimum of the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels
- `min_y` equals the minimum of the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels
- `max_x` equals the maximum of the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels
- `max_y` equals the maximum of the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels

After executing the code:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `max_x`, and `max_y` remain unchanged.
- `min_x` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `x`.
- `min_y` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `y`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel
- `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 3 elements
- `min_x` equals the minimum of its previous value and `x`
- `min_y` equals the minimum of its previous value and `y`
- `max_x` equals the maximum of the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels
- `max_y` equals the maximum of the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 3 elements, `min_x` is the minimum of the previous `min_x` and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of the previous `min_y` and `y`, `max_x` equals the maximum of the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels, `max_y` equals the maximum of the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels**
