The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` by taking the minimum between their current values and the coordinates `x` and `y` of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`. 

Since `min_x` initially equals `float('inf')` and `min_y` initially equals `float('inf')`, and `x` and `y` are the coordinates of a pixel, `min_x` becomes `x` and `min_y` becomes `y` after the update. 

The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, 
`white_pixels` is a non-empty list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', 
`min_x` equals `x`, 
`min_y` equals `y`, 
`max_x` equals `float('-inf')`, 
`(x, y)` is the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a non-empty list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals `float('-inf')`, `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`.**
