The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their current values and the x and y coordinates of the second 'w' pixel. 

`max_x` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel) and `x` (the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel). 

`max_y` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel) and `y` (the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel).

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 2 elements, `min_x` equals the minimum of the x-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels, `min_y` equals the minimum of the y-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels, `max_x` equals the maximum of the x-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels, `max_y` equals the maximum of the y-coordinates of the first and second 'w' pixels.
