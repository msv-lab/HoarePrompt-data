According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` is a non-empty list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`, `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals `x`, `max_y` equals `y`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements and `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the second 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`. 
State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 2 elements, `min_x` equals the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel, `min_y` equals the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel, `max_x` equals the x-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel, `max_y` equals the y-coordinate of the first 'w' pixel, `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the second 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`**
