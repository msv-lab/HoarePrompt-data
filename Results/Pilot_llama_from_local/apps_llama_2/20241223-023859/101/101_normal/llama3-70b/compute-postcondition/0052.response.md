Postcondition: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals '.'), then `pixels[i][j]` equals '+'. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', the state of the program remains unchanged and we move to the next iteration. If `pixels[i][j]` equals '.' and the condition ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) is not met, then the current state of `pixels` and other variables remains unchanged, with `pixels[i][j]` equal to '.'.**
