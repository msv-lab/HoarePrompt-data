According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` variable. If `pixels` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is `n`, and `j` is `m`. 

Since `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` and `n` and `m` are both greater than or equal to 1, `pixels` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `pixels` must have at least 1 row and `row` is the first row in `pixels`, and `i` and `j` should be adjusted to be within the bounds of the `pixels` list to reflect the state before the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `row` is the first row in `pixels`**
