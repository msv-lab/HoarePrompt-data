You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n must be at least 1.
Output state after the loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is 2, 'i' is 2 , n must be at least 2.
Output state after the loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is 6 , 'i' is 3 , n must be at least 3.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list that must have at least one student, student is the first student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student, 'students_num' is 2, students is a list that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student plus the third student, 'students_num' is 3, students is a list that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**

Your Task:

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, and `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i
            ][j] == '.':
            pixels[i][j] = '+'
        elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
            continue
        else:
            pixels[i][j] = '.'

```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' reflecting the original 'w' pixel distribution, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, and `i` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and loop code.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D list `pixels` of size `n x m`, where `n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 2000 (inclusive), and `n` must be greater than 1.
   - For each position `(i, j)` in `pixels`, it checks if the current position is on the border (i.e., `i == min_x` or `i == max_x` or `j == min_y` or `j == max_y`) and if the pixel at that position is `'.'`. If both conditions are true, it marks the pixel as `'+'`.
   - If the pixel is `'w'`, it skips to the next iteration without changing the pixel's value.
   - If the pixel is neither on the border nor `'w'`, it ensures the pixel remains `'.'`.

2. **Output State After All Iterations**:
   - Given that the loop iterates over each column `j` in `pixels` for a fixed row `i = 1`, we can infer that the loop will execute `m` times, where `m` is the number of columns in `pixels`.
   - After all iterations, `i` remains 1 because the loop does not modify `i`; it only iterates over `j`.
   - `j` will be `m` after the loop finishes because the loop iterates `m` times, and the last iteration will be for `j = m - 1` (since indexing starts at 0), but after the loop ends, `j` will be incremented one last time, making it equal to `m`.
   - The state of `pixels` will have been modified according to the border conditions for the row `i = 1`. Specifically, any pixel at position `(1, j)` that was originally `'.'` and was on the border (as defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`) will have been changed to `'+'`. All other pixels in the row `i = 1` that were `'w'` will remain `'w'`, and those that were not on the border will remain `'.'`.
   - `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` will retain their original values because the loop does not modify these variables.
   - `n` and `m` will retain their original values as well since the loop does not modify them.

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - If the list `pixels` is empty (which would mean `m = 0`), the loop would not execute, and all variables would retain their initial values.
   - The loop's execution and modifications to `pixels` are contingent upon the original values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and the content of `pixels` itself.

**Output State**: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where the row `i = 1` has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 1, `j` is `m`.**
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: 


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the output states for the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
