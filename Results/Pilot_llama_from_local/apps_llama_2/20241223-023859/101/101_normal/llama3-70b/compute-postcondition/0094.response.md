The provided Python code snippet is `print(''.join(row))`. This line of code prints the string representation of the `row` variable, which is the second row in the `pixels` 2D list. 

The `row` variable is described as the second row in `pixels`, so `row` equals `pixels[1]`. The `print` function does not modify any variables but simply outputs the value of `row` to the console.

The output state after running the Python code is: 
`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, 
`m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, 
`pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, 
`white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', 
the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 0, 
`row` is the second row in `pixels`, 
the first three rows of `pixels` have been printed, and 
the string representation of the second row in `pixels` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `row` is the second row in `pixels`, the first three rows of `pixels` have been printed**
