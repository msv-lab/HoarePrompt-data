The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` modifies the value of `pixels` at position `(i, j)` to `'+'`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 1. 

The value of `pixels` at position `(1, 1)` is updated to `'+'`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m` must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where `pixels[1][1]` equals `'+'` and the first row (`i = 0`) has been modified according to the border conditions, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
