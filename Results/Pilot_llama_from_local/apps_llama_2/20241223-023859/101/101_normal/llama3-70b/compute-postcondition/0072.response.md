The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration in the loop. Since we are given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', the `continue` statement does not change any variable values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, it is not the case that ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we skip to the next iteration of the loop**
