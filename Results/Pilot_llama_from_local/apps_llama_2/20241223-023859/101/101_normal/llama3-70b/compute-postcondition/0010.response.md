According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` has at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements. 

 Considering the new element is added to `white_pixels`, it should also be a 'w' pixel in the `pixels` 2D list, therefore the size of `pixels` remains the same. Also, the new 'w' pixel will have its own coordinates. 

State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w' and has at least 3 elements, `min_x` equals the minimum of the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels, `min_y` equals the minimum of the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels, `max_x` equals the maximum of the x-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels, `max_y` equals the maximum of the y-coordinates of the first, second and third 'w' pixels**
