According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `m` is already given as an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, this condition is already met. However, for the loop to start executing, `j` should be 0, which is already given. The loop will iterate over the range of `m`, so the state of `m` should be maintained as it is, and `j` should start from 0.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, and `i` is 2, `j` is 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
