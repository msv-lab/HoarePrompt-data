According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `j` is not specified, but since the loop can execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` is not specified at the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `j` is some value `k` where `k` is less than `m`. Now, `j` should be `k + 1`. 

No other state variables are affected by the loop condition, so they remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `frame_size` is `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `j` is `k + 1` where `k + 1` is less than `m`**
