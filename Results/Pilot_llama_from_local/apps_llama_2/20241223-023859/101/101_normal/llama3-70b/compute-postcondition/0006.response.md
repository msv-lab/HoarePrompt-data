The code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` based on the values of `x` and `y`. 

Initially, `max_x` equals `float('-inf')` and `max_y` is not defined in terms of other variables but since (x, y) are the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`, let's use these (x, y) in place of `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`. 

After executing the code, `max_x` will be the maximum of its initial value `float('-inf')` and `x`, and `max_y` will be the maximum of its initial value (let's consider it to be `min_y` equals `y`) and `y`.

Given `max_x` is initially `float('-inf')`, it will be updated to `x` because `x` is greater than `float('-inf')`.

For `max_y`, it is the maximum of `y` and `y` which is `y`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a non-empty list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals `x`, `max_y` equals `y`, `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with at least one 'w' pixel, `white_pixels` is a non-empty list of tuples (x, y) where `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals `x`, `max_y` equals `y`, `(x, y)` is the coordinates of the first 'w' pixel in `white_pixels`.**
