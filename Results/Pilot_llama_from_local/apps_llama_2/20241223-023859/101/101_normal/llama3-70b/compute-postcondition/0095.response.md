According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` 2D list. If the list has at least 2 rows, the loop executes again for the next row. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `row` is the second row in `pixels`, the first two rows of `pixels` have been printed (though the problem states the first three rows have been printed, this will be corrected in the state update). So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `row` must be the next row in `pixels`. 
State: **`n` is an integer where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer where `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where all border positions that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of tuples (x, y) where the original `pixels[x][y]` equals 'w', the original `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` reflect the original frame size before the loop's execution, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `row` is the third row in `pixels`, the first three rows of `pixels` have been printed**
