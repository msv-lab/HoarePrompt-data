If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, all border positions in `pixels` that were originally `'.'` have been changed to `'+'`, all `'w'` pixels remain unchanged, and other pixels remain `'.'`, and all rows in `pixels` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts the resolution of the monitor (n and m) and the corresponding pixel data (n lines of m characters each), where each character represents either a black pixel (.) or a white pixel (w). It then identifies the bounding box of the white pixels, calculates the size of the frame that would enclose all white pixels, and checks if this frame size exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor. If it does, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it transforms the input pixel data by replacing black pixels on the border of the bounding box with '+' characters, leaving white pixels unchanged, and prints the resulting pixel data. The function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None), but instead prints the modified pixel data or an error message to the console. The state of the program after execution includes the modified pixel data printed to the console, with the original input variables (n, m, pixels, white_pixels, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y, frame_size) retaining their values from the last point of execution. Potential edge cases include: an empty input (which is not handled by the function), a single white pixel (handled correctly), and a frame size exceeding the monitor size (handled correctly). The function assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e., the correct number of lines and characters per line is provided, and that there is at least one white pixel. Missing functionality includes handling invalid or malformed input.
