Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It accepts the resolution of the monitor (n and m) and the corresponding pixel data (n lines of m characters each), where each character represents either a black pixel (.) or a white pixel (w).

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program identifies the bounding box of the white pixels by finding the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels. This is done using the `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` variables.

2. The program calculates the size of the frame that would enclose all white pixels by finding the maximum of the differences between `max_x` and `min_x` and between `max_y` and `min_y`, and adding 1. This is stored in the `frame_size` variable.

3. The program checks if the calculated `frame_size` exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor. If it does, the program prints -1, indicating that it's not possible to draw a frame around the white pixels within the monitor's boundaries.

4. If the `frame_size` is within the monitor's boundaries, the program transforms the input pixel data by replacing black pixels on the border of the bounding box with '+' characters, leaving white pixels unchanged. This is done using nested for loops to iterate over each pixel in the input data.

5. Finally, the program prints the modified pixel data, which represents the frame around the white pixels.

The program handles all the cases specified in the problem description, including:

- A single white pixel (handled correctly, as the program will draw a frame of size 1 around it)
- A frame size exceeding the monitor size (handled correctly, as the program will print -1 in this case)
- An empty input (not applicable, as the problem description guarantees that there is at least one white pixel)

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for all valid input cases.
