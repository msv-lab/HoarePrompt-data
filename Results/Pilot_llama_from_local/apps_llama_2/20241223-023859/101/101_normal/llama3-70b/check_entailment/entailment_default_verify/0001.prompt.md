You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

-----Note-----

In the first sample the required size of the optimal frame equals 4. In the second sample the size of the optimal frame equals 3. In the third sample, the size of the optimal frame is 1. In the fourth sample, the required frame doesn't exist.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y) = (float('inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf'))
    for (x, y) in white_pixels:
        (min_x, min_y) = (min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y))
        (max_x, max_y) = (max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y))
    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if frame_size > max(n, m):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or (j == max_y)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

I analyzed the program and compared it with the problem description, and it appears to be correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores the monitor pixels in a 2D list.
2. It identifies the white pixels and finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among them.
3. It calculates the frame size based on the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.
4. If the frame size exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor, it correctly prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist.
5. Otherwise, it constructs the frame by marking the border pixels with '+' and leaves the white pixels unchanged.
6. Finally, it prints the modified monitor screen.

I couldn't find any cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the frame size is 1 or when the white pixels are scattered across the monitor.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly identifies the frame size as 4 and prints the corresponding frame. Similarly, in the fourth example, the program correctly prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts the resolution of the monitor (n and m) and the corresponding pixel data (n lines of m characters each), where each character represents either a black pixel (.) or a white pixel (w). It then identifies the bounding box of the white pixels, calculates the size of the frame that would enclose all white pixels, and checks if this frame size exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor. If it does, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it transforms the input pixel data by replacing black pixels on the border of the bounding box with '+' characters, leaving white pixels unchanged, and prints the resulting pixel data. The function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns None), but instead prints the modified pixel data or an error message to the console. The state of the program after execution includes the modified pixel data printed to the console, with the original input variables (n, m, pixels, white_pixels, min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y, frame_size) retaining their values from the last point of execution. Potential edge cases include: an empty input (which is not handled by the function), a single white pixel (handled correctly), and a frame size exceeding the monitor size (handled correctly). The function assumes that the input is well-formed, i.e., the correct number of lines and characters per line is provided, and that there is at least one white pixel. Missing functionality includes handling invalid or malformed input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
