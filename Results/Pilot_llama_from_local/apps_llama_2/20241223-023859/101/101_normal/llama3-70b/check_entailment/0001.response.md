Correctness: **True**

I analyzed the program and compared it with the problem description, and it appears to be correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores the monitor pixels in a 2D list.
2. It identifies the white pixels and finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among them.
3. It calculates the frame size based on the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.
4. If the frame size exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor, it correctly prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist.
5. Otherwise, it constructs the frame by marking the border pixels with '+' and leaves the white pixels unchanged.
6. Finally, it prints the modified monitor screen.

I couldn't find any cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the frame size is 1 or when the white pixels are scattered across the monitor.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly identifies the frame size as 4 and prints the corresponding frame. Similarly, in the fourth example, the program correctly prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
