Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the minimum frame size that can encompass all the white pixels, and then prints the frame with '+' characters.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. It first finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels.
2. It calculates the frame size as the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates, plus 1.
3. If the frame size exceeds the maximum dimensions of the monitor, it prints -1, indicating that a valid frame does not exist.
4. Otherwise, it iterates over the pixels and marks the pixels on the frame as '+' if they are not white, and leaves the white pixels as 'w'.
5. Finally, it prints the modified pixel matrix.

The program handles various edge cases correctly, such as:
- If there are multiple possible frames of the same minimum size, it prints any one of them.
- If the required frame does not exist (i.e., its size exceeds the monitor dimensions), it prints -1.
- If the input contains only one white pixel, it correctly prints a frame of size 1.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected according to the problem description.
