Correctness: **True** 

The program provided appears to correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. It correctly identifies the bounding box of the white pixels, calculates the size of the frame that would enclose all white pixels, and checks if this frame size exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor. If the frame size does exceed the maximum dimension, it correctly prints -1. Otherwise, it transforms the input pixel data by replacing black pixels on the border of the bounding box with '+' characters, leaving white pixels unchanged, and prints the resulting pixel data.

The program handles all the provided examples correctly, including cases where the required frame does not exist. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking for invalid input does not affect the correctness of the program.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, it should work correctly for all valid inputs and provide the expected output.
