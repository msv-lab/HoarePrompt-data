Correctness: **False**.

The code provided attempts to solve the problem by identifying the bounding box of the white pixels and then drawing a frame around it. However, the code does not check if the identified frame is a square. According to the problem description, the frame should be a square with a width of 1 pixel. If the frame is not a square, the code should either draw a square frame around the white pixels or print -1 if it's not possible.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 3
w..
w..
w..
w..
w..
```

The code will draw a frame of size 5x3 around the white pixels, which is not a square. However, a square frame of size 5x5 can be drawn around the white pixels, which meets the problem requirements. The code should either draw this square frame or print -1 if it's not possible.

Another issue with the code is that it does not handle the case where the white pixels are not fully contained within the frame. According to the problem description, all white pixels should be located on the frame. If there are white pixels inside the frame, the code should either print -1 or draw a new frame that meets the problem requirements.

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for all potential cases and needs to be modified to meet the problem requirements.
