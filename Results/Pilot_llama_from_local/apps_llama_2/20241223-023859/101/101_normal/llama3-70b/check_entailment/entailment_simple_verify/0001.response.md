The original assessment appears to be accurate, as the program correctly implements the logic to find the smallest square frame that encompasses all white pixels. 

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior, and it seems to align with the original assessment. The program correctly:

1. Reads the input and stores the monitor pixels in a 2D list.
2. Identifies the white pixels and finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates among them.
3. Calculates the frame size based on the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates.
4. If the frame size exceeds the maximum dimension of the monitor, it correctly prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist.
5. Otherwise, it constructs the frame by marking the border pixels with '+' and leaves the white pixels unchanged.
6. Finally, it prints the modified monitor screen.

The annotated version confirms that the program's state at each point matches the expected behavior. For example, after the first loop, the program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels.

One potential issue that could be raised is the handling of cases where the frame size is equal to the monitor size. However, the program correctly handles this case by printing the frame as expected.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
