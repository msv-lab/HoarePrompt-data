Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of all white pixels ('w') on the screen.
2. It then calculates the size of the frame by finding the maximum difference between the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates and adding 1.
3. If the frame size is greater than the maximum of the screen width and height, it prints -1, indicating that the required frame does not exist.
4. Otherwise, it iterates over the screen pixels and marks the border positions (where the original pixel is '.' and the position is on the frame) with '+'.
5. The program leaves the original 'w' pixels unchanged and ensures that other pixels remain '.'.
6. Finally, it prints the modified screen.

The program handles all cases as specified in the problem description, including:

- Correctly calculating the frame size based on the white pixels.
- Handling cases where the frame size exceeds the screen dimensions.
- Marking border positions with '+' while preserving 'w' pixels.
- Ensuring other pixels remain '.'.
- Printing the modified screen as required.

The provided examples also demonstrate that the program behaves as expected in different scenarios, such as finding the optimal frame size, handling frames that fit within the screen, and identifying cases where no valid frame exists. 

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description's requirements and handles various potential cases as expected.
