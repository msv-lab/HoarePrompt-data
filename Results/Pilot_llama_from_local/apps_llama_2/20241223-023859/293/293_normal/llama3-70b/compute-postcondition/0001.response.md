The code snippet defines a new variable `ans` and assigns it the value 0. This does not affect the values of `h` and `n`. 

The value of `h` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`. Additionally, `ans` is now 0.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, and `ans` is 0**
