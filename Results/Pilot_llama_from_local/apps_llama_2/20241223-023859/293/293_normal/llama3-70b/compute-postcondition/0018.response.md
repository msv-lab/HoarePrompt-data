To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state specifies that:
- `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50.
- `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2).
- If `n` is even, `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.

The code provided is `n //= 2`.

This operation divides `n` by 2 and assigns the integer part of the result back to `n`. 

So, after executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` will be halved. 

Given that `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2), after the division, `n` will be less than or equal to 2^(`h`-3) because 2^(`h`-2) divided by 2 equals 2^(`h`-3).

The conditions for `ans` being increased still depend on the parity of `n`, but now `n` has been halved.

The range of `h` (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50) remains unchanged as the operation does not affect `h`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 (since it could be 2 before the division and become 1 after) and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-3).
- If the new `n` is even, `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`.
- If the new `n` is odd, `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-3), `ans` depends on the parity of the new `n`**
