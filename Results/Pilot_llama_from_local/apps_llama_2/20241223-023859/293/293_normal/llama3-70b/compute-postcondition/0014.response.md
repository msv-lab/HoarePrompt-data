According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

Since the range of `h` is 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2), we don't need to adjust `h`. 

State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2)**
