It appears that the provided function definition is incomplete, as it does not accept any parameters. However, based on the given parameter constraints, I will describe the expected functionality.


The function is expected to accept two parameters, `h` and `n`, where `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^h (inclusive). 


Since the output cases are not specified, I will provide a general description of the functionality.


Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, h and n, where h is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and n is a positive integer between 1 and 2^h, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
