To calculate the output state, let's first understand the initial state and the given code. The initial state specifies that `h` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^(`h`-1). The code snippet provided is `ans += n // 2`, which implies that the value of `ans` is being incremented by the integer division of `n` by 2.

Given that `n` must be greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-1), and considering the operation `ans += n // 2`, we need to understand that `ans` is being increased by half of `n`, but since `//` denotes integer division in Python, the result will be the integer part of `n` divided by 2.

Therefore, without knowing the exact initial value of `ans` but understanding that `h` and `n` are constrained as specified, the output state after executing the code will reflect the change in `ans` based on the value of `n`. The constraints on `h` and the relationship between `h` and `n` remain unchanged, as does the range of possible values for `n` based on `h`. The only variable directly affected by the code is `ans`, which increases by `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-1), `ans` is increased by `n // 2`.**
