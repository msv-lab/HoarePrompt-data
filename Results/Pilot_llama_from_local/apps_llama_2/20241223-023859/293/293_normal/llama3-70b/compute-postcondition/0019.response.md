To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given conditions and the pattern observed from the output states after executing the loop a few times.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n > 1`. This means `n` will be divided by 2 in each iteration until it reaches 1 or less.

2. **Update of `ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on whether `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, `ans` increases by `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd, `ans` increases by `n // 2`.

3. **Division of `n`**: In each iteration, `n` is divided by 2 (`n //= 2`), which effectively reduces `n` to its half in each step until `n` becomes 1 or less.

Given these points, let's consider the possible scenarios for `n` and how `ans` would be affected:

- **Scenario when `n` is a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8,...)**: In each iteration, `n` will be halved until it becomes 2, and then in the next iteration, it becomes 1, ending the loop. For `n = 2^k`, `ans` will accumulate values based on the parity of `n` at each step, but since `n` starts as a power of 2, it will always be even until the last step, contributing `(2^k // 2 - 1) + (2^(k-1) // 2 - 1) +... + (2^1 // 2 - 1)` to `ans`. However, this does not account for the last iteration when `n` becomes 1, as the loop ends before processing `n=1`.

- **Scenario when `n` is not a power of 2**: The process is similar, but `n` might be odd at some point, affecting how `ans` is incremented. However, the loop will still end when `n` reaches 1 or less.

Considering the loop will end when `n` is 1 or less, the final value of `n` after the loop will always be 1 (if the initial `n` was greater than 1) because the loop condition checks for `n > 1`, and once `n` reaches 1, the loop exits. If the initial `n` was 1, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains 1.

For the value of `ans`, it accumulates based on the divisions of `n` by 2 and the parity of `n` at each step. The exact formula for `ans` after the loop is complex due to the conditional increment based on `n`'s parity. However, we can conclude that `ans` ends up being a function of the original value of `n`, specifically related to the number of times `n` can be divided by 2 before reaching 1, and the parity of `n` at each division step.

Given the constraints and behavior of the loop, the output state after all iterations can be characterized as follows:

- `h` remains an input integer between 1 and 50, as it does not change during the loop.
- `n` will be 1 after the loop, assuming the initial `n` was greater than 1. If `n` started at 1, it remains 1 since the loop does not execute.
- `ans` depends on the original value of `n`, accumulating increments based on the divisions of `n` by 2 and the parity of `n` at each step.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is 1, `h` remains unchanged, and `ans` is a value accumulated based on the divisions and parities of the original `n` during the loop executions, specifically tailored to how many times `n` was halved and its parity at each halving step.**
