The value of `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`, where `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2) and `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Since `n` is greater than 1, `n // 2` will be at least 1 (for `n` = 2 or 3) and `n // 2 - 1` will be at least 0. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2), `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`.
Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2), `ans` is equal to its original value plus `n // 2 - 1`**
