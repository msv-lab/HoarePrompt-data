The value of `n` is changed by performing integer division by 2. This operation effectively halves the value of `n` and discards any remainder. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `n` is initially greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-1), after the division, `n` will be greater than or equal to 1 (since the smallest value `n` could be before the division is 2, which becomes 1 after division) and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2), because the maximum value `n` could be before the division is 2^(`h`-1), which becomes 2^(`h`-2) after division.

The condition regarding `h` remains unchanged since `h` is not modified by the code.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2)**
