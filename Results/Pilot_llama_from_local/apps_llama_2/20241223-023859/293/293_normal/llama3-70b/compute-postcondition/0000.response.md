The values of `h` and `n` are updated based on the input provided. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and `map(int,...)` converts these substrings to integers. The `h, n =...` assignment then unpacks this list of integers into the variables `h` and `n`.

Given the initial state constraints that `h` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, the new values of `h` and `n` must also be integers but are now directly determined by the input. The constraints from the initial state are still applicable in terms of the range of values `h` and `n` can take (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`), but `h` and `n` are now input integers.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`.**
