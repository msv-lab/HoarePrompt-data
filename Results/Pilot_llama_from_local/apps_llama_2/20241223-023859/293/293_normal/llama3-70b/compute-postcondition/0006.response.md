To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50,
- `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 1 and `n` ≤ 2^`h`,
- `ans` is 0,
- `n` is odd (i.e., `n` % 2!= 0).

The code is: `ans += n // 2`.

Given that `n` is odd, we can express `n` as `n = 2k + 1`, where `k` is an integer. When we do `n // 2`, we are essentially doing integer division, which discards the remainder. So, `n // 2` would be equivalent to `k`.

The value of `ans` after execution would be `ans = 0 + k`, which simplifies to `ans = k`. Since `n = 2k + 1`, we can express `k` as `k = (n - 1) / 2`. Therefore, `ans = (n - 1) / 2`.

The output state, considering all information, is:
- `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50,
- `n` is an input integer such that `n` > 1 and `n` ≤ 2^`h`, and `n` is odd,
- `ans` is `(n - 1) / 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an odd input integer such that `n` > 1 and `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `ans` is `(n - 1) / 2`.**
