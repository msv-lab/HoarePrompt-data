The value of `ans` is increased by the integer division of `n` by 2. The initial state of `h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2). The states of `h` and `n` are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is greater than 1 and `n` ≤ 2^(`h`-2), `ans` is increased by `n // 2`**
