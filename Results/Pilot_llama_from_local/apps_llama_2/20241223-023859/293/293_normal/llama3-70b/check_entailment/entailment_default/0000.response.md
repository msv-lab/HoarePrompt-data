Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given code calculates the number of nodes visited by Amr before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height `h`. The code iteratively halves the value of `n` (the exit node) until it reaches 1, accumulating the `ans` value based on the parity of `n` at each halving step. 

When `n` is even, the code adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans`, which represents the number of nodes visited in the left subtree. When `n` is odd, the code adds `n // 2` to `ans`, which represents the number of nodes visited in the right subtree. 

This approach correctly simulates Amr's algorithm, which follows the infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." and skips commands when the destination node is already visited. 

The code handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is a power of 2 and when `n` is an odd number. The loop condition and the calculations within it ensure that `n` is progressively halved until it reaches 1, accumulating the `ans` value accordingly.

The provided examples also support the correctness of the code, as the output matches the expected results for different inputs. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the code analysis, it appears that the code correctly calculates the number of nodes visited by Amr before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height `h`.
