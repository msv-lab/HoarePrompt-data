You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
def func():
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        n //= 2
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately calculates the number of nodes visited by Amr before reaching the exit node in the binary tree.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- It takes the height `h` of the binary tree and the exit node `n` as input.
- It initializes a variable `ans` to 0 to store the total number of nodes visited.
- The program then enters a while loop, which continues until `n` becomes 1 (i.e., the root node).
- Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it means the exit node is a right child, so it adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans` (since Amr visits all nodes on the left subtree and the parent node). If `n` is odd, it means the exit node is a left child, so it adds `n // 2` to `ans` (since Amr visits all nodes on the left subtree).
- After updating `ans`, it divides `n` by 2 to move to the parent node.
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point `ans` contains the total number of nodes visited.

This logic accurately simulates Amr's movement through the binary tree, visiting nodes according to the given rules and skipping nodes that have already been visited. The program handles all potential cases correctly, as it takes into account the parity of `n` at each level and updates `ans` accordingly.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness, and it is reasonable to conclude that the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: h is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.
def func():
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    while n > 1:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ans += n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ans += n // 2
        
        n //= 2
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 1, `h` remains unchanged, and `ans` is a value accumulated based on the divisions and parities of the original `n` during the loop executions, specifically tailored to how many times `n` was halved and its parity at each halving step.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `h` and `n`, where `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^h. It calculates and returns a value, `ans`, which is accumulated based on the divisions and parities of the original `n` during the loop executions, specifically tailored to how many times `n` was halved and its parity at each halving step. The final state of the program is that `n` is reduced to 1, `h` remains unchanged, and the calculated `ans` value is printed out, providing the result based on the input parameters `h` and `n`. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is a power of 2 and when `n` is an odd number, as the loop condition and the calculations within it ensure that `n` is progressively halved until it reaches 1, accumulating the `ans` value accordingly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
