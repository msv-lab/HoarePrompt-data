Correctness: **True**

The given program is a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately calculates the number of nodes visited by Amr before reaching the exit node in the binary tree.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

- It takes the height `h` of the binary tree and the exit node `n` as input.
- It initializes a variable `ans` to 0 to store the total number of nodes visited.
- The program then enters a while loop, which continues until `n` becomes 1 (i.e., the root node).
- Inside the loop, it checks if `n` is even or odd. If `n` is even, it means the exit node is a right child, so it adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans` (since Amr visits all nodes on the left subtree and the parent node). If `n` is odd, it means the exit node is a left child, so it adds `n // 2` to `ans` (since Amr visits all nodes on the left subtree).
- After updating `ans`, it divides `n` by 2 to move to the parent node.
- The loop continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point `ans` contains the total number of nodes visited.

This logic accurately simulates Amr's movement through the binary tree, visiting nodes according to the given rules and skipping nodes that have already been visited. The program handles all potential cases correctly, as it takes into account the parity of `n` at each level and updates `ans` accordingly.

The provided examples demonstrate the program's correctness, and it is reasonable to conclude that the program will produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
