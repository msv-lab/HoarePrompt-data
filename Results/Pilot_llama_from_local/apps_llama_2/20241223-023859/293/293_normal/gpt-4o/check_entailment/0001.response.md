Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. The problem states that Amr follows a specific algorithm to choose the path, using an infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." and executing the characters of the string using specific rules. However, the given program does not follow this algorithm.

Instead, the program calculates the path to the exit node using binary representation and then counts the number of nodes visited in that path. This approach does not take into account the rules specified in the problem, such as skipping commands if the destination node is already visited, going back to the parent node if two consecutive commands are skipped, and returning to the parent node if a leaf node that is not the exit is reached.

For example, if we consider the input `1 2`, the program will output `1`, but according to the problem description, Amr will visit 2 nodes (the root and the right child) before reaching the exit. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the algorithm described in the problem, taking into account all the rules specified. The given program does not do this and therefore does not produce the correct output for all cases.
