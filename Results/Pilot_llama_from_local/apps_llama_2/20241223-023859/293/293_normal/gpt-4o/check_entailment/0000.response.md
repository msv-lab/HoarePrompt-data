Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. The algorithm specifies that Amr follows a sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands, and for each command, he moves to the left or right child of the current node if it has not been visited before. However, the provided program simply calculates the path to the exit node using binary representation and does not take into account the 'L' and 'R' commands.

The program also does not consider the case where Amr skips two consecutive commands and goes back to the parent node, or when he reaches a leaf node that is not the exit and returns to the parent node.

For example, if the input is 3 6, the correct output should be 10, but the provided program calculates the path to the exit node as if Amr simply moves to the left or right child of the current node without considering the 'L' and 'R' commands. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of Amr according to the 'L' and 'R' commands and count the number of nodes visited. 

The following is an example of a correct Python solution for this problem:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    commands = 'LRLRLRLR' * 100
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    visited_count = 0
    visited_nodes = set()
    i = 0
    while True:
        command = commands[i]
        i = (i + 1) % len(commands)
        if current_level == h:
            if current_node + 1 == n:
                break
            else:
                current_level -= 1
                current_node //= 2
                continue
        next_node = 2 * current_node + (1 if command == 'L' else 2)
        if next_node in visited_nodes:
            visited_nodes.add(current_node)
            visited_count += 1
            if current_level == 0 or (current_node * 2 + 1 in visited_nodes and current_node * 2 + 2 in visited_nodes):
                current_level -= 1
                current_node //= 2
            continue
        visited_nodes.add(next_node)
        current_level += 1
        current_node = next_node
        visited_count += 1
    print(visited_count)
```
