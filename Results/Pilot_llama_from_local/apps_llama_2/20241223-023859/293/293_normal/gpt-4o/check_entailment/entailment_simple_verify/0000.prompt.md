You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
    print(visited_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. The algorithm specifies that Amr follows a sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands, and for each command, he moves to the left or right child of the current node if it has not been visited before. However, the provided program simply calculates the path to the exit node using binary representation and does not take into account the 'L' and 'R' commands.

The program also does not consider the case where Amr skips two consecutive commands and goes back to the parent node, or when he reaches a leaf node that is not the exit and returns to the parent node.

For example, if the input is 3 6, the correct output should be 10, but the provided program calculates the path to the exit node as if Amr simply moves to the left or right child of the current node without considering the 'L' and 'R' commands. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of Amr according to the 'L' and 'R' commands and count the number of nodes visited. 

The following is an example of a correct Python solution for this problem:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    commands = 'LRLRLRLR' * 100
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    visited_count = 0
    visited_nodes = set()
    i = 0
    while True:
        command = commands[i]
        i = (i + 1) % len(commands)
        if current_level == h:
            if current_node + 1 == n:
                break
            else:
                current_level -= 1
                current_node //= 2
                continue
        next_node = 2 * current_node + (1 if command == 'L' else 2)
        if next_node in visited_nodes:
            visited_nodes.add(current_node)
            visited_count += 1
            if current_level == 0 or (current_node * 2 + 1 in visited_nodes and current_node * 2 + 2 in visited_nodes):
                current_level -= 1
                current_node //= 2
            continue
        visited_nodes.add(next_node)
        current_level += 1
        current_node = next_node
        visited_count += 1
    print(visited_count)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers h and n, where h is the height of a perfect binary tree and n is a leaf node, such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is `h`, `path` is a string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 0, and `current_node` is determined by the binary path in `path`, starting from 0 and updating based on '0' or '1' directions.
    print(visited_count)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
