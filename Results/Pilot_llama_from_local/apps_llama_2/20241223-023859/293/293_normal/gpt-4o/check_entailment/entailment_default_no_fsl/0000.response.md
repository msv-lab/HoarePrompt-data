Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not accurately implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. According to the problem description, Amr follows the commands in the string "LRLRLRLRL..." and visits nodes based on these commands. However, the given code simply calculates the number of nodes visited by traversing the path from the root to the given leaf node `n`, without considering the actual commands in the string or the fact that Amr skips commands if the destination node is already visited.

The code only checks the path to the leaf node, but it does not consider other nodes that may be visited due to the commands in the string. For example, when Amr reaches a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node. This is not handled in the provided code.

A correct implementation should simulate the process of following the commands in the string "LRLRLRLRL..." and keep track of visited nodes. Based on the examples given, it seems that the output of the code should be the total number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node, excluding the exit node itself. However, the code provided does not implement this logic correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to simulate Amr's movement through the tree based on the commands in the string and keep track of the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node. The provided code does not do this and therefore does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
