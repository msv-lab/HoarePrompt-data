To calculate the result, we first look at the given initial state: 
- `h` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`
- `total_leaves` is 2^`h`
- `visited_count` is 4
- `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left
- `current_level` is 2
- `direction` is the third character in `path`
- `current_node` is updated based on the new `direction`

The given Python code is `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2`. 
This means the value of `current_node` is doubled and then increased by 2.

Given the initial state, we know that `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, and `direction` do not change with this operation. 
The only variable that changes is `current_node`, which becomes `2 * current_node + 2`. 

So, the output state after running the Python code is: 
- `h` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`
- `total_leaves` is 2^`h`
- `visited_count` is 4
- `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left
- `current_level` is 2
- `direction` is the third character in `path`
- `current_node` is `2 * current_node + 2`

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 2 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left, `current_level` is 2, `direction` is the third character in `path`, and `current_node` is `2 * current_node + 2`**
