The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigning the `read` function from `sys.stdin` to the variable `input`. 

The states of the variables `h` and `n` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: The input consists of two integers `h` and `n`, where `h` is the height of a perfect binary tree and `n` is a leaf node, such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, and `input` is now a function that reads from standard input.
