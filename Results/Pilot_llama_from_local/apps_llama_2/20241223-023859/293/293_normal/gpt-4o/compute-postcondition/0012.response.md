The given code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Since `current_node` is initially 0, the new value of `current_node` becomes `2 * 0 + 2 = 2`. 

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code, so they remain the same.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, `direction` is '1'**
