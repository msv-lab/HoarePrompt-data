The value of `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 1, and `current_node` is `(2 * previous_current_node) + 2` where `previous_current_node` is the value of `current_node` before the update, and the `direction` is the second character in `path`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is `(2 * previous_current_node) + 2`, and `direction` is the second character in `path`**
