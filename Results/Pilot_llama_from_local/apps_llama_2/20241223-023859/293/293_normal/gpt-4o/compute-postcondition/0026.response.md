The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `h` and `n`. `h` is the height of a perfect binary tree and `n` is a leaf node. The constraints on `h` and `n` are such that `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 raised to the power of `h` (inclusive). 

However, the output description of the function is missing, which is crucial for determining the return value of the function based on the input parameters. Given the information provided, we can only describe the parameters the function accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, h and n, where h is the height of a perfect binary tree and n is a leaf node, with h between 1 and 50 and n between 1 and 2^h.**
