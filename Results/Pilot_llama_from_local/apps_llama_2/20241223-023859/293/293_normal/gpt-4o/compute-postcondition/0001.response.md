The code assigns the values of `h` and `n` based on the input provided. The `input().split()` function splits the input into two parts, which are then converted to integers using the `map` function and assigned to `h` and `n`, respectively.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 2^`h`, and the input has been read from standard input.**
