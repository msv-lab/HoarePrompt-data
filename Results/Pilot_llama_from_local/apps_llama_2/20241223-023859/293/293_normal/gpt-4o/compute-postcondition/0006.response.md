The code introduces a new variable `current_node` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 0, `path` is `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 0**
