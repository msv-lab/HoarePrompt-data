The given code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. 

The initial state provides information about several variables: `h` is an integer between 2 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left, `current_level` is 2, and `direction` is the third character in `path`. 

However, the only variable directly affected by the given code is `current_node`. The new value of `current_node` is calculated as `2 * current_node + 1`, which means it is updated based on its previous value.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 2 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left, `current_level` is 2, `direction` is the third character in `path`, and `current_node` is `2 * current_node + 1`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 2 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left, `current_level` is 2, `direction` is the third character in `path`, and `current_node` is `2 * current_node + 1`**.
