Postcondition: **`h` is an integer between 2 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)` with at least 2 characters left, `current_level` is 2, `direction` is the third character in `path`, and if `direction` is '0', `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`, otherwise `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`.**
