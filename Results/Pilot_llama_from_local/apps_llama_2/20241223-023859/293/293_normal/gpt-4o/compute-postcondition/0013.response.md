Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 0, if the `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is 1, otherwise `current_node` is 2, and the `direction` is the first character in `path`***
