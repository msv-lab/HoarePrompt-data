The code updates the `current_node` variable by multiplying it by 2 and adding 1. This means `current_node` is now the right child of its previous value. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is 2 * previous `current_node` + 1, and the `direction` is the second character in `path`**
