The code `total_leaves = 2 ** h` assigns the value of 2 raised to the power of `h` to `total_leaves`. Given that `h` is an input integer between 1 and 50, the value of `total_leaves` will be between 2^1 and 2^50. 

Since `n` is an input integer between 1 and 2^`h` and `h` has been read from standard input, the value of `n` will be less than or equal to `total_leaves`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`**
