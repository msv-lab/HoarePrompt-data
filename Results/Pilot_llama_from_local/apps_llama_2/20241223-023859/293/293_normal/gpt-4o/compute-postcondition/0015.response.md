The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` was 2, so the new value is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty string of length `h` derived from `bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)`, `current_level` is 1, if the next character in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is updated to the left child of the previous node (2 * previous `current_node`), otherwise `current_node` is updated to the right child (2 * previous `current_node` + 1), and the `direction` is the second character in `path`.
