The input to the function is an integer n, where n is a positive integer, 1 <= n <= 10^9, representing the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.
The given code `n = int(input())`, assigns `n` the value of an input integer.
However, since `n` was already defined as a positive integer, and the new value is also an integer, we can conclude that the output state is `n` is an input integer, where the input integer is a positive integer, 1 <= n <= 10^9.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer**
