The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is stated that there is an input to the function which is an integer `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. But since `n` is not passed as a parameter to the function `func()`, we can assume it's defined somewhere else in the scope of this function. The function's output is not specified in the problem, so we cannot provide a specific return value.


Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, its input is defined somewhere else in the scope and it is an integer n, where n is a positive integer, but the return value is not specified.**
