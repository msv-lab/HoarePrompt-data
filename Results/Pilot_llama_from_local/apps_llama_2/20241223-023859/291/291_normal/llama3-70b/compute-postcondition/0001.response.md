The code calculates the value of `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` and prints it. The `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent the integer `n` in binary. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, let's denote the number of bits necessary to represent `n` as `bit_length(n)`. 

The expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` can be simplified as follows: 
- `n.bit_length()` gives the number of bits required to represent `n`.
- Subtracting 1 from this value gives `n.bit_length() - 1`.
- Multiplying the result by 2 gives `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1)`.
- Finally, adding 2 to the result gives `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`.

Since the code only prints the calculated value and does not modify `n`, the value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, and the printed value is `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`**
