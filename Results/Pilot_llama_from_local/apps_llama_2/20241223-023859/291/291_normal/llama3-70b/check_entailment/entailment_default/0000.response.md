Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a simple function that calculates the minimum number of steps required to draw a certain number of squares using the formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. The function does not handle invalid input cases, but according to the problem description, we assume that the input will always be a valid positive integer between 1 and 10^9.

To verify the correctness of the code, we need to understand how the formula works. The concept behind the formula is based on the fact that every square requires two new segments (one horizontal and one vertical) to be drawn using a ruler, except for the first row and column of squares, which require only one new segment each. 

For example, if `n` is a power of 2, then the number of rows (or columns) is `2^k`, where `k` is the bit length of `n` minus 1. In this case, we need to draw `2^k - 1` segments in the first row (or column) using a ruler (since the first segment is drawn manually, and the rest can be drawn using the previous segment as a guide), and then we can draw the remaining rows (or columns) without using a ruler.

The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` takes into account the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` (which is equivalent to the number of rows or columns) and calculates the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn using a ruler.

We have tested the function with the provided examples, and the output matches the expected results.

Based on the provided output hints and the problem description, the code seems to work correctly for all valid inputs. However, it's worth noting that the code assumes that the input will always be a valid positive integer, and it does not handle invalid input cases. But as per the problem description, we assume the input will be valid. 

The code does not return any error for any valid input, and we could not find any case where the code does not work as expected in the problem description. Therefore, the code seems to be correct.
