You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly calculates the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares.

The logic behind the code is based on the fact that for each square, two segments can be drawn using a ruler as a guide, except for the first two segments of the first row and the first segment of each subsequent row. The number of rows required to draw n squares is equal to the number of bits required to represent n (n.bit_length()). 

For each row, we need to draw one horizontal segment using a ruler and for the first row, we need to draw one vertical segment using a ruler. For each subsequent row, we need to draw two vertical segments using a ruler. Therefore, the total number of segments that need to be drawn using a ruler without a guide is 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2.

The code correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge case where n is 1. The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code. 

In the case where n = 1, the code correctly outputs 2, as Sofia will need to draw two segments using a ruler to form a square. 

In the case where n = 2, the code correctly outputs 3, as Sofia will need to draw three segments using a ruler to form two squares.

In the case where n = 4, the code correctly outputs 4, as Sofia will need to draw four segments using a ruler to form four squares.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the code does not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input to the function is an integer n, where n is a positive integer, 1 <= n <= 10^9, representing the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the minimum number of steps required to draw a certain number of squares, represented by the variable n, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. The function does not accept any parameters, instead, it reads the input from the user through the standard input. The function takes this input, calculates the minimum number of steps using the formula 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2, and prints the result. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result to the console. The state of the program after execution will be that the input integer n has been processed, and the calculated minimum number of steps has been printed to the console. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer, and it assumes that the input will always be a valid positive integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
