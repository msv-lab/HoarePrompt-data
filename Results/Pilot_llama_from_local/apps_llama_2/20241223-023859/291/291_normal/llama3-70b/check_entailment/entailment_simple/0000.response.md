Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for the minimum number of segments that Sofia must draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares.

The program calculates this number using the formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. To understand why this formula works, let's break it down:

1. **Bit Length Calculation**: The `bit_length()` method in Python returns the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary. For example, for $n = 4$, the binary representation is $100$, which requires 3 bits, so `bit_length()` returns $3$. This has implications for the layout of squares.

2. **Layout Implications**: The minimum number of guided segments is closely related to the binary representation of $n$. In a layout that minimizes the use of a ruler, each square added in the most efficient way will sometimes require no new segments to be drawn with a ruler, and other times it will require one new segment to be drawn with a ruler for every additional row or column of squares.

3. **Formula Explanation**: The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` can be understood as follows:
    - The `bit_length() - 1` part calculates the number of bits excluding the most significant bit (which represents $2^{bit\_length() - 1}$). This effectively gives the number of "doublings" or additional rows/columns needed to reach the number of squares $n$.
    - Multiplying by `2` accounts for both horizontal and vertical segments needed for each "doubling".
    - Adding `2` accounts for the initial square which requires 2 segments to be drawn with a ruler.

This formula aligns with the efficient strategy Sofia would use: she first draws a square (2 segments), then for each bit set in the binary representation of $n$ (excluding the least significant bit which just adds another square without needing a new ruler-guided segment), she adds a row or column, which requires 2 new segments (one horizontal, one vertical) for each bit, thus requiring a total of `2 * (bit_length() - 1)` segments for these additions. 

This strategy ensures that she never draws more than the minimum necessary segments with a ruler, fulfilling the condition set out in the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct as it computes the minimum number of segments Sofia must draw with a ruler without a guide based on the binary representation of $n$, following the most efficient strategy possible under the constraints given.
