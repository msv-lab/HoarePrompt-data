The function calculates and prints the minimum number of steps required to draw a certain number of squares, represented by the variable n, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. The function does not accept any parameters, instead, it reads the input from the user through the standard input. The function takes this input, calculates the minimum number of steps using the formula 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2, and prints the result. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result to the console. The state of the program after execution will be that the input integer n has been processed, and the calculated minimum number of steps has been printed to the console. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a positive integer, and it assumes that the input will always be a valid positive integer.
