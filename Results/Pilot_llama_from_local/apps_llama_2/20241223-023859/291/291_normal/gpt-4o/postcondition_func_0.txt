The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and returns the minimum value of the expression `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all integers `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`. The function iterates through all possible values of `a` in the specified range and calculates the corresponding value of `segments_needed`, keeping track of the minimum value encountered. The function's return value represents the minimum number of segments needed for a given input `n`. The code correctly handles the specified range of input values and does not have any apparent missing logic or edge cases that are not addressed by the provided implementation.
