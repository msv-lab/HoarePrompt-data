Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler without a guide. 

The problem description suggests that the minimum number of segments is related to the number of squares that need to be drawn, and that it should be possible to draw the remaining segments using the first ones as a guide. However, the provided program calculates the minimum number of segments based on a simple mathematical formula that does not take into account the specifics of the problem.

A correct solution should consider the arrangement of squares and how segments can be reused. For example, if we want to draw `n` squares, we can arrange them in a grid with `a` rows and `b` columns, where `a` and `b` are integers such that `a * b >= n`. In this case, we need to draw `a + b` vertical and horizontal segments to form the grid, and then we can draw the remaining segments using these as a guide.

A correct implementation would be to find the arrangement of squares that minimizes the number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler. This can be achieved by iterating over all possible arrangements of squares and calculating the number of segments needed for each arrangement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

min_segments_needed = float('inf')
for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % a == 0:
        b = n // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b - 2) + 2
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)

print(min_segments_needed)
```
However, note that the original problem description does not specify the exact arrangement of squares, so the solution may not be unique. 

For example, when n = 1, the program returns 4, but the correct answer is 2. When n = 4, the program returns 6, but the correct answer is 4. 

The correct program would be:
```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
print(2 * int(math.sqrt(n)) if n == int(math.sqrt(n)) ** 2 else 2 * (int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1) if n < int(math.sqrt(n)) ** 2 + int(math.sqrt(n)) else 2 * int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)
```
