Correctness: **False**

This problem requires determining the minimum number of segments Sofia needs to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw `n` squares. The provided code seems to attempt to find this minimum number by iterating over possible arrangements of squares.

However, upon analyzing the code, we can see that the function `func_1(n)` is not actually being called with the correct number of segments. The line `print(func_1(n))` is calling `func_1(n)` before it's defined, so this will cause a NameError.

Additionally, the function itself seems to be calculating the minimum segments needed based on a formula that doesn't directly relate to the problem description. The formula `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` seems to be related to the number of rows and columns in a grid of squares, but it doesn't account for the fact that Sofia can draw segments using existing segments as guides.

Let's consider the case where `n` is 1. In this case, Sofia needs to draw 2 segments with a ruler without a guide (one vertical and one horizontal) and then 2 segments using the first two as guides. The code should return 2 for this case, but the formula `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` will return a value of 4 for `a = 1`, which is incorrect.

The output hints seem to agree with the code, but they don't provide any examples that would suggest the code is correct. In fact, the hints seem to be describing the code itself rather than the problem it's trying to solve. 

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described, and its output does not match the expected output for all cases.
