Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler without a guide to draw n squares.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly consider the number of segments needed to draw the squares. According to the problem description, Sofia can draw a segment using a previously drawn segment as a guideline if the new segment has the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as the previous segment. However, the program does not take this into account when calculating the minimum number of segments needed.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to consider the arrangement of the squares such that the minimum number of segments need to be drawn. One such arrangement can be achieved by drawing the squares in a grid, with each row and column having the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn.

For example, if Sofia wants to draw n squares, she can arrange them in a grid of size ceil(sqrt(n)) x floor(sqrt(n)), where ceil is the ceiling function and floor is the floor function. In this arrangement, each row and column needs to have one segment drawn with a ruler without a guide, and the remaining segments can be drawn using the previously drawn segments as guidelines.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
def func_1(n):
    return int(2 * (math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)) + math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) - 1))

print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version of the program calculates the minimum number of segments needed to draw n squares by arranging them in a grid of size ceil(sqrt(n)) x floor(sqrt(n)), and then returns this minimum number.
