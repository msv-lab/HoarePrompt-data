You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Here's a brief explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The program calculates the full cycle length, which is the total number of questions asked in a complete cycle of rows.
2. It then calculates the number of full cycles completed and the remaining questions.
3. The minimum and maximum number of questions asked are calculated based on the number of full cycles and the position of the rows.
4. The program also correctly handles the case when Sergei is asked in the remaining questions.

To verify the correctness of the program, I have considered various edge cases, such as:

* When there is only one row (n = 1), the program handles it correctly by setting the full cycle length to m.
* When the number of rows is greater than 1 (n > 1), the program correctly calculates the full cycle length and handles the direction changes.
* When Sergei is in the first or last row, the program correctly calculates the number of times he is asked.
* When Sergei is in an intermediate row, the program correctly calculates the number of times he is asked based on the remaining questions.

After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, k is a non-negative integer, and x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, and `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, and both `min_questions` and `max_questions` equal `k // m`.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 *
    n - 2) >= x)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`. If `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, `min_questions` equals `k // m`, `max_questions` equals `k // m`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, the update formula for `sergei_questions` as provided does not apply due to division by zero, however since `n` equals 1 and `x` is either 0 or `n-1` which is also 0, then `sergei_questions` equals `k // m`. If `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1` but `n` equals 1, then this case is impossible because `n` equals 1, and `x` cannot be other than 0, hence this case does not affect the result.
