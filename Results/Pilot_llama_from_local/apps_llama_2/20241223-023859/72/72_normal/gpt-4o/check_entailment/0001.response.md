Correctness: **True** 

The provided Python program seems to accurately implement the logic described in the problem. It correctly calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1.  It first calculates the full cycle length, which is the number of questions asked in a complete cycle of rows. If there's only one row, the full cycle length is the number of pupils in that row.
2.  It then calculates the number of full cycles and the remaining questions.
3.  For the case where there's more than one row, it calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions by dividing the full cycles by the number of rows in a cycle.
4.  It then calculates the number of questions Sergei was asked, taking into account whether he's in the first or last row.
5.  Finally, it processes the remaining questions and updates the maximum number of questions and Sergei's questions accordingly.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there's only one row or when Sergei is in the first or last row.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided examples also match the expected output.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct and works as intended for all potential cases.
