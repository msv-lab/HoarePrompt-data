Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. The problem description states that the teacher asks pupils in a specific order, and the program should calculate the minimum and maximum number of questions asked to any pupil. However, the program only calculates the number of questions asked to the pupils in the first and last row, and does not correctly account for the pupils in the middle rows.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 1. In this case, the program should simply calculate the number of questions asked to Sergei, which is `k // m` plus 1 if `y` is 0 or `k % m == 0`. However, the program's calculation of `sergei_questions` does not account for this case correctly.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of questions asked to a pupil. The program only increments `max_questions` when the teacher is moving in the positive direction, but it should also increment `max_questions` when the teacher is moving in the negative direction and is asking a pupil that has not been asked before in the current cycle.

Overall, the program does not correctly follow the problem description, and there are several cases where it does not produce the correct output. 

Here is a high-level explanation of why the program fails:

1. **Incorrect calculation of min_questions**: The program calculates `min_questions` as `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, but this is not correct. The minimum number of questions asked to a pupil should be calculated based on the number of full cycles and the position of the pupil in the class.

2. **Incorrect calculation of sergei_questions**: The program calculates `sergei_questions` based on the number of full cycles and the position of Sergei in the class, but it does not correctly account for the case when `n` is 1.

3. **Incorrect calculation of max_questions**: The program calculates `max_questions` by incrementing it only when the teacher is moving in the positive direction, but it should also increment `max_questions` when the teacher is moving in the negative direction and is asking a pupil that has not been asked before in the current cycle.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be rewritten to correctly calculate the minimum and maximum number of questions asked to any pupil, and to correctly handle the case when `n` is 1. The program should also be tested with a variety of inputs to ensure that it produces the correct output in all cases.
