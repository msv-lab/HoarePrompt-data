You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, k is a non-negative integer, and x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x <= n and 1 <= y <= m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, and `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, and both `min_questions` and `max_questions` equal `k // m`.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 *
    n - 2) >= x)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`. If `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, `min_questions` equals `k // m`, `max_questions` equals `k // m`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, the update formula for `sergei_questions` as provided does not apply due to division by zero, however since `n` equals 1 and `x` is either 0 or `n-1` which is also 0, then `sergei_questions` equals `k // m`. If `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1` but `n` equals 1, then this case is impossible because `n` equals 1, and `x` cannot be other than 0, hence this case does not affect the result.
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `x` are non-negative integers, `row` is between 0 and `n-1`, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `max_questions` is updated based on the net movement, `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of encounters with `(x, y)`, and `remaining_questions` is 0.
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
