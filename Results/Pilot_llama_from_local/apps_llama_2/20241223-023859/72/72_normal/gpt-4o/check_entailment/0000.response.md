Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Here's a brief explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The program calculates the full cycle length, which is the total number of questions asked in a complete cycle of rows.
2. It then calculates the number of full cycles completed and the remaining questions.
3. The minimum and maximum number of questions asked are calculated based on the number of full cycles and the position of the rows.
4. The program also correctly handles the case when Sergei is asked in the remaining questions.

To verify the correctness of the program, I have considered various edge cases, such as:

* When there is only one row (n = 1), the program handles it correctly by setting the full cycle length to m.
* When the number of rows is greater than 1 (n > 1), the program correctly calculates the full cycle length and handles the direction changes.
* When Sergei is in the first or last row, the program correctly calculates the number of times he is asked.
* When Sergei is in an intermediate row, the program correctly calculates the number of times he is asked based on the remaining questions.

After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
