Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `row - 3`, `direction` is -1, and if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, and `remaining_questions` is at least 0. If `row` does not equal `n`, then the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `row` being `row + direction`, and `remaining_questions` being at least 1 if `direction` is 1 and at least 0 if `direction` is -1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1.***
