Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, if `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 3`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged except for `max_questions` which is still `max_questions - 1`**
