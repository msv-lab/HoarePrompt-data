The value of `direction` is updated to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `direction` is now -1, `remaining_questions` is at least 0. The other conditions and variables remain the same.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `row` is `row + direction`, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is at least 0**
