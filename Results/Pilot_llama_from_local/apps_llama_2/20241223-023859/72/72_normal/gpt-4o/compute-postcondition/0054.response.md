According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `col` must be less than `m` to execute the loop again. Since `col` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `col` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is increased by 1**
