Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` has been increased by 1 from its previous updated value, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1. If `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is set to `n - 2`, `col` is 0, and `direction` is -1. If `row` is not equal to `n` and `direction` is 1, the state of `row`, `col`, and `direction` remains as it was before the if statement, which means `row` could be any value between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `col` is 0, and `direction` is 1. If `direction` is -1, then if `row` was -1, `row` is 1 and `direction` is 1. If `row + 1` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `col` is 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1; otherwise, `col` is 0. In all cases, `col` is 0 and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0.**
