Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3` and `direction` is -1, with `sergei_questions`, `remaining_questions`, `max_questions` retaining their updated values based on the initial conditions if applicable. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as initially described with `row` being `row + direction`.***
