Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` is between 0 and `n`, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is updated, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; the current value of `direction` is 1, indicating a specific direction, and all other conditions related to `row`, `col`, and the questions variables apply given this direction, with the state of the variables otherwise consistent with the precondition, including the special conditions when `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
