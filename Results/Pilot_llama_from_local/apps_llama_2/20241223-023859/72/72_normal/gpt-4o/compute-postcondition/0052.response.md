Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `row` was -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 2, and `col` remains unchanged. `sergei_questions` could have been increased by 1 if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `row` not being -1.**
