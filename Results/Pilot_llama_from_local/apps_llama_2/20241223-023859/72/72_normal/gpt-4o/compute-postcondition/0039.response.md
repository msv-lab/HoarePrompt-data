Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `direction` equals 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `direction` equals `-1`, `row` is `n - 2`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1. The value of `col` could be either its original value or 0 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. Additionally, `max_questions` could have been increased by 1 and `sergei_questions` could have been increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` does not equal `n` and `direction` is 1, then the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `y` retain their original values, `row` is `row + 1`, `direction` is 1, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1, with `max_questions` could have been increased by 1 and the value of `sergei_questions` could also have been increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `direction` does not equal 1, then if `row` was -1, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is 1, `col` is 0 unless it was `y` before this operation, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `col` is 0. Otherwise, `direction` is not 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is `row + direction`, and if initially `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, otherwise, `col` retains its original value unless it was `y` and `row` was `x` before this operation.**
