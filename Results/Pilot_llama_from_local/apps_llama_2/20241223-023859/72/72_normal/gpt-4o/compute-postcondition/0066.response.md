Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` remains the same. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 3, and if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, then `col` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is not -1, then the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition, with `row` being `row + direction`, `col` increased by 1 if `row + direction` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, `sergei_questions` increased by 1 if `row + direction` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, and `max_questions` decreased by 1 if `row + direction` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`.***
