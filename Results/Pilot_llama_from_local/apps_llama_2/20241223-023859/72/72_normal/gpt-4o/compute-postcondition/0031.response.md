Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `row` equals `n`, then `direction` equals `-1`, `row` is `n - 2`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1. The value of `col` could be either its original value or 0 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. Additionally, `max_questions` could have been increased by 1 and `sergei_questions` could have been increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` does not equal `n`, then the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `direction`, `remaining_questions`, `row`, and `col` retain their original values, with `row` being `row + 1` as stated in the precondition, and `max_questions` could have been increased by 1. The value of `sergei_questions` could also have been increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
