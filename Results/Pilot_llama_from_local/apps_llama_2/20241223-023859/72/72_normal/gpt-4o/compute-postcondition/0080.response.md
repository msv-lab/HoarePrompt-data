Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `max_questions` has been increased by 1 from its previous updated value, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `row` is equal to `n`, then `row` is set to `n - 2`, `col` is 0, and `direction` is -1. If `row` is not equal to `n`, the state of `row`, `col`, and `direction` remains as it was before the if statement, which means `row` could be any value between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `col` is 0, and `direction` is 1.***
