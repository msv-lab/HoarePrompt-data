Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `row` is between 0 and `n`, `col` is 0, `direction` is -1, `max_questions` is updated, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `n`, `m`, and `k` being positive integers, `y` being a non-negative integer, `row` being between 0 and `n`, `col` being 0, `direction` is -1, and `remaining_questions` being greater than 0**
