The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected except for the fact that `col` is increased by 1 as per the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, then the original value of `col` and `sergei_questions` are increased by 1. `max_questions` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, then the original value of `col` and `sergei_questions` are increased by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1**
