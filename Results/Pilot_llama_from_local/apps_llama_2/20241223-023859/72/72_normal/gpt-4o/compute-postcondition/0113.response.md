The value of `direction` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `row` is `row + 1`, if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `row` is `row + 1`, if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is 1**
