Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `row` was -1, then `row` is 1, `direction` is 1. If `row + 1` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `col` is 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1; otherwise, `col` is 0. In all cases, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0.***
