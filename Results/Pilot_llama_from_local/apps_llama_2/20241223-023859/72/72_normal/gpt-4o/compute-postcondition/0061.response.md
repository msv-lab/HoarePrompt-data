Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by a total of 3 from its initial value and `direction` is -1. In all cases, `col` is increased by 1 or 2 depending on the initial values of `row`, `x`, `col`, and `y`, if the new `row` value equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and the increase in `col` is 2, otherwise the increase in `col` is 1.**
