The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `y` are positive integers such that `1 <= x <= n` and `1 <= y <= m`. 

Unfortunately, the provided problem description is incomplete as it does not specify the return value of the function. Therefore, I will provide a general description based on the given parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, where n and m are positive integers, k is a non-negative integer, and x and y are positive integers within the ranges 1 to n and 1 to m, respectively, but the return value is not specified.**
