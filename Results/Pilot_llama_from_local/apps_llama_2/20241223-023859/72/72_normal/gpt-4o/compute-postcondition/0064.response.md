The code only changes the value of `direction` to 1. Other conditions will depend on the new value of `direction`. 
`row` is `row + 1`, `col` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, `x` remains the same, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`. 
The values of `n`, `m`, `k` are unchanged and are still positive integers, and `y` is still a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 1`, `col` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, `x` is the same, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`.**
