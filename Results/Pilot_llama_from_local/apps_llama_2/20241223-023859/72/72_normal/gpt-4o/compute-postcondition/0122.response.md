Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 0, `row` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `direction` is either 1 or -1, `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` plus 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1***
