Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`. If `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, `min_questions` equals `k // m`, `max_questions` equals `k // m`. If `x` is either 0 or `n - 1`, the update formula for `sergei_questions` as provided does not apply due to division by zero, however since `n` equals 1 and `x` is either 0 or `n-1` which is also 0, then `sergei_questions` equals `k // m`. If `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1` but `n` equals 1, then this case is impossible because `n` equals 1, and `x` cannot be other than 0, hence this case does not affect the result.***
