The value of `direction` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is -1, and `col` is 0 unless it was `y` and `row` was `x` before this operation, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is -1 and `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is -1, `col` is 0 unless it was `y` and `row` was `x` before this operation, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the current value of `row` is -1 and `col` is 0**
