The code changes the value of `direction` to 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` is -1, `direction` is 1, if `row + 1` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `col` is 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; otherwise, `col` is 0 and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0**
