The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer, `m` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is still a positive integer, `y` is still a non-negative integer, `col` is still 2, and `remaining_questions` is still greater than 0 but now `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`. The condition that if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
