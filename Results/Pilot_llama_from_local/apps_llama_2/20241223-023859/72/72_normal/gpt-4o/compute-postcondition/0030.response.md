The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The initial value of `row` is `n`, so the new value of `row` is `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` equals `-1`, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `row` is `n - 2`, `col` has a value that could be either its original value or 0 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` could have been increased by 1, `sergei_questions` could have been increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
