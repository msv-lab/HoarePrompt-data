Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 0, if `direction` is 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is `n - 2`, `direction` is -1, and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction` plus 1, otherwise `row` is `row` + 1 and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction` plus 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` after the update, then `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` plus 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `direction` is -1, then if `row` is -1, `row` is 1, `direction` is 1, and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and 0, otherwise `row` is `row` - 1, `direction` is -1, and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction` minus 1. In all cases, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` after the update, then `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` plus 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1 if `direction` is 1 and at least 0 if `direction` is -1.**
