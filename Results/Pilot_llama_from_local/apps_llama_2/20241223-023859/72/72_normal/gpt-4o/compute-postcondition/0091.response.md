Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` could be any value between 0 and `n` (inclusive) or 1 if `row` was -1, `direction` could be 1 or -1, `max_questions` has its updated value, `col` is 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is `sergei_questions + 1`.**
