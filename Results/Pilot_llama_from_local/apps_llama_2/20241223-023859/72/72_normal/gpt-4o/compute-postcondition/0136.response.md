Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 0, if `row` is -1, then `row` is 1, `direction` is 1, and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and 0. If `row` - 1 equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` plus 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 0. If `row` is not -1, then the state remains as it was before the if statement, with `row` being `row` - 1, `direction` being -1, `max_questions` being the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction` minus 1.***
