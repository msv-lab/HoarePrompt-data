Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, initially `direction` equals 1, initially `remaining_questions` is at least 1. The current value of `row` is `n`, `col` has a value that could be either its original value or 0 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, the current value of `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `remaining_questions` retain their original values, and `max_questions` could have been increased by 1, `sergei_questions` could have been increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
