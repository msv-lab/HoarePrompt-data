Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` equals 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current value of `row` is 0, the current value of `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the current value of `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `row`, `remaining_questions`, and `col` retain their original values.**
