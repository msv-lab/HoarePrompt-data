According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_questions`. If `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0, which means it must be at least 1.

State: **`m` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is `m`, `row` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `direction` is either 1 or -1, `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction`, `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1**
