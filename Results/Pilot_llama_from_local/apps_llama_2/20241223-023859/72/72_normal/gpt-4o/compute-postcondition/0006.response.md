The value of `min_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`m` is a positive integer, 
`k` is a non-negative integer, 
`y` is a non-negative integer, 
`x` equals `x - 1`, 
`full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`, 
`full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, 
`remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, 
and `min_questions` equals `full_cycles` which is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `k // m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, and `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `k // m`**
