Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 3`, and if `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` is not -1, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `row` being `row + direction`, and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
