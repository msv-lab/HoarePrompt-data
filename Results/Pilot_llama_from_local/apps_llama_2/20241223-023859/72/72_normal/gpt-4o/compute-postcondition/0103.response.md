According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `col` must be increased by 1, so `col` is 2. Since `m` must be greater than `col` for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0**
