The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected, except that regardless of the condition, `col` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `col` and `sergei_questions` are increased by 1, but since `col` is increased regardless, the net effect on `col` in this case is an increase of 2, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `col` is increased by 2, otherwise `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and the increase in `col` is 2, otherwise the increase in `col` is 1**
