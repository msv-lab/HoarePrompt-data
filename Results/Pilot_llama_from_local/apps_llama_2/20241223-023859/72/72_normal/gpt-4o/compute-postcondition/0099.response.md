The value of `direction` is now set to 1. Other variables are not affected by this change. 
The states of the other variables remain the same as before: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` is `row + direction` which is now `row + 1`, `max_questions` is its previous value minus 1, `col` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. Additionally, if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is `sergei_questions + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` is `row + 1`, `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is its previous value minus 1, `col` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, and if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is `sergei_questions + 1**
