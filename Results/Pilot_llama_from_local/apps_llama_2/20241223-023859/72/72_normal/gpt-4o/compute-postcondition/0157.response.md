The code changes the value of `direction` to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by -1, if `row - 1 + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, but now since direction is assigned -1 so `row` is actually decreased by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1, `row` is decreased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
