Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, `row`, `direction`, `remaining_questions`, and `col` retain their original values.***
