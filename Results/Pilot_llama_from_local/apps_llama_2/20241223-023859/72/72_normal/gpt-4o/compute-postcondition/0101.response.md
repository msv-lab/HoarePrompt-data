Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is its previous value minus 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3`, `direction` is 1, and if `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is `sergei_questions + 1`. Otherwise, the state remains the same as the precondition.***
