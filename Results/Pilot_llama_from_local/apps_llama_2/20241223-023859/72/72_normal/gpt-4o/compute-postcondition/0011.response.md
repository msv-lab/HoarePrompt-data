Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, and `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, and both `min_questions` and `max_questions` equal `k // m`.**
