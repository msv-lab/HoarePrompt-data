The value of `y` is decremented by 1, and since `y` is initially a positive integer, its new value will be a non-negative integer (0 or more). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer (`y` = initial `y` - 1), and `x` is `x - 1`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is `x - 1`.**
