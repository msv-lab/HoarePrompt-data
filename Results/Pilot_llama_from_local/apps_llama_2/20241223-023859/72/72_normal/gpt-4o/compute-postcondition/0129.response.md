Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 0, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `n - 2`, `direction` is -1, and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction` plus 1, if `n - 2` + 1 equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `n - 2` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` plus 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the initial value plus the number of times `n - 2` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise `row` is `row` + 1, and `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction` plus 1, if `row` + 1 equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` plus 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, in both cases `remaining_questions` is at least 1***
