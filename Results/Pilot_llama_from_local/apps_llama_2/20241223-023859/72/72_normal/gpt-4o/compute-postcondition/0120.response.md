Postcondition: **`m` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 0, `row` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive) and currently equals `x`, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `max_questions` is the updated value based on the number of iterations and the final `direction`, `sergei_questions` is the initial value plus the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` and has been incremented since `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `remaining_questions` is at least 1, the current value of `col` is 0 and equals `y`, and the current value of `row` equals `x`.**
