The given code increments `max_questions` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
