To determine the output state, let's analyze the initial state and the given Python code.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `y` is a non-negative integer
- `x` equals `x - 1` (this implies `x` is actually any value since `x - 1` doesn't give us a specific value without knowing the original `x`, but let's keep it as is since it doesn't affect our calculation directly)
- `full_cycle_length` equals `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`

The code is: 
```python
full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
```

Given the code, `full_cycles` is assigned the value of the integer division of `k` by `full_cycle_length`. 

Since `full_cycle_length` depends on `n` and `m`, let's break it down:
- If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m`
- If `n` equals 1, `full_cycle_length = m`

The value of `full_cycles` will thus be `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, or `k // m` if `n = 1`.

The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `y`, and the formula for `x` are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is a positive integer
- `k` is a non-negative integer
- `y` is a non-negative integer
- `x` equals `x - 1`
- `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`
- `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `k // m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`, and `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `k // m`**
