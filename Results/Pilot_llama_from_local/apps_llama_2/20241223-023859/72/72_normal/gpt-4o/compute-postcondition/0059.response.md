The value of `direction` is assigned to -1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected, but the future changes in `row` will be affected by this new value of `direction`. The initial conditions about the increases in `max_questions`, `row`, `col`, and `sergei_questions` are still valid, but now `row` will be decreased by 1 because `direction` is -1. The increase in `col` is still dependent on the condition `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, but now `row + direction` is `row - 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is decreased by 1, `col` is increased by 1 or 2 depending on the initial values of `row`, `x`, `col`, and `y`, if `row - 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and the increase in `col` is 2, otherwise the increase in `col` is 1, `direction` is -1**
