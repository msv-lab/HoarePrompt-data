Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than 1 then the current value of `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, the current value of `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, the current value of `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, the current value of `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, the current value of `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, and the current value of `sergei_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`. If `n` is 1 then the current value of `full_cycle_length` is `m`, the current value of `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, the current value of `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`, the current value of `min_questions` equals `k // m`, the current value of `max_questions` equals `k // m`, and the current value of `sergei_questions` equals `k // m`. There is a variable `x` and its value is either 0 or `n - 1`.**
