The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are updated based on the input. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into five integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, respectively. Therefore, `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values of the five input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, where `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 <= `x` <= `n` and 1 <= `y` <= `m` may not hold true anymore as `x` and `y` can now be any positive integer and `n` and `m` can also be any positive integer**
