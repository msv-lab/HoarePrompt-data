Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1. `direction` is updated based on the conditions: if `direction` is 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is `n - 2`, `direction` is -1, otherwise `row` is `row` + 1; if `direction` is -1, then if `row` is -1, `row` is 1, `direction` is 1, otherwise `row` is `row` - 1. `max_questions` is updated based on the number of iterations and the final `direction`. `remaining_questions` is at least 1 if `direction` is 1 and at least 0 if `direction` is -1.***
