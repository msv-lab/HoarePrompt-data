Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is `max_questions + 1`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is adjusted to `row - 2` (or set to 1 if the adjustment results in a value less than 0), and `direction` is set to -1. If `direction` is -1, then `max_questions` is its previous value minus 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3` (which will be 2), `direction` is 1, and if `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is `sergei_questions + 1`. In all cases, if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` could be `sergei_questions + 1`.**
