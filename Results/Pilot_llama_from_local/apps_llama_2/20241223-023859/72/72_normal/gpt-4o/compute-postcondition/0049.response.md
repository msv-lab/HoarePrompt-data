The value of `row` is updated by adding `direction` to it. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 


Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. `row` is `row + direction`, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `col` is `col` unless `row` equals `n` and `direction` equals 1 and `remaining_questions` is at least 1, then `col` is `col + 1` if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col + 1` equals `y` then `max_questions` could have been increased by 1 but now is `max_questions - 1`. If `direction` equals -1 and `row` equals -1, then `direction` is 1 and `row` is 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1. If `row + direction` equals `x` and `col + 1` equals `y` then `row` is 0, `col` is `col + 1` unless `col` equals `y` or `m`.**
