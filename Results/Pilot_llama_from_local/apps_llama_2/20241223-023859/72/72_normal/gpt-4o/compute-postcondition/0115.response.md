Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`. If `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 2`, `direction` is 1, and if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` is not -1, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
