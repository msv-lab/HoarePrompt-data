The code calculates the value of `max_questions` based on `full_cycles` and `n`. Since `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the value of `max_questions` is calculated as `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. 

Given that `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, we substitute `full_cycles` into the equation for `max_questions`: 

`max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` equals `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`**
