The value of `row` is updated by adding `direction` to it. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `direction` remains the same, `row` is `row + direction`, `remaining_questions` is at least 1 if `direction` is 1 and at least 0 if `direction` is -1.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, `direction` remains the same, `row` is `row + direction`, `remaining_questions` is at least 1 if `direction` is 1 and at least 0 if `direction` is -1**
