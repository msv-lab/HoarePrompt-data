Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, if `row` was -1, then `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is 1, `col` is 0 unless it was `y` before this operation, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `col` is 0. Otherwise, `direction` is not 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is `row + direction`, and if initially `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, otherwise, `col` retains its original value unless it was `y` and `row` was `x` before this operation.***
