Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer. The current value of `row` is -1. If `row + 1` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `col` is 0, `direction` is -1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; otherwise, `col` is 0, `direction` is -1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0.**
