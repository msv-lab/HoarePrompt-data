To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for _ in range(remaining_questions):`. This means the loop will execute as long as there are remaining questions, i.e., `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following state:
- `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers.
- `y` is a non-negative integer.
- `row` is between 0 and `n`.
- `direction` is either 1 or -1 depending on the last boundary it hit.
- `max_questions` is updated based on the number of steps taken downwards minus the number of steps taken upwards.
- `sergei_questions` is increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` throughout the iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_questions` must decrease by 1, since the loop iterates over the range of `remaining_questions`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` is between 0 and `n`, `direction` is either 1 or -1, `max_questions` is updated, `sergei_questions` is increased, and `remaining_questions` must be greater than 0**
