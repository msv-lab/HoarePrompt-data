The value of `full_cycle_length` is calculated based on the values of `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is assigned the value `(2 * n - 2) * m`, otherwise, it is assigned the value `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` is `x - 1`, and `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`.**
