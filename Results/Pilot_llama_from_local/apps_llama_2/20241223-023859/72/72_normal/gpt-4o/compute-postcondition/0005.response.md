The variable `remaining_questions` is assigned the value of `k % full_cycle_length`. The value of `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `remaining_questions` will be the remainder of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length`, which is the remainder of `k` divided by `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise the remainder of `k` divided by `m`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `x` equals `x - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` equals `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1`, otherwise `full_cycles` equals `k // m`, and `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `remaining_questions` equals `k % m`**
