According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and `col`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `col` is 1 and `m` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `col` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `col` should be 2. The values of `m`, `n`, `k`, `y`, `row`, `direction`, `max_questions`, `sergei_questions`, and `remaining_questions` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they remain the same.

State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2**
