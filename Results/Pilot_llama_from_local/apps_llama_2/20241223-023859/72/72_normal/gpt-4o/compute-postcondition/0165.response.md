Postcondition: ***`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `direction` is -1 and `row` is decreased by 3. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 3`. Regardless of the condition, `row` is updated to `row + direction` if `row` is not -1 and `direction` is not 1, or `row` is `n - 3` if `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n`. If at any point `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
