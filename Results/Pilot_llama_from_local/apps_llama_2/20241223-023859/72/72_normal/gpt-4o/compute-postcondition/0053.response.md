Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `direction` equals 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is updated to `row - 3` and `direction` is -1. Otherwise, `row` is `row + 1` if `direction` is 1 and `row` is not `n`. If `direction` does not equal 1, then if `row` was -1, `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 2. In all cases, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` could have been increased by 1. The state of `max_questions` and `remaining_questions` could have been updated based on the initial conditions if applicable. If none of the above conditions are met, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
