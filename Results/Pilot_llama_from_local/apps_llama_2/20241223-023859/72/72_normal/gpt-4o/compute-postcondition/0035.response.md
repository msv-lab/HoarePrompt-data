Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `direction` is not 1, `remaining_questions` is at least 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, initially `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current value of `row` is -1, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, otherwise, the current value of `row` is -1, and `col` retains its original value unless it was `y` and `row` was `x` before this operation, and the current value of `row` equals -1**
