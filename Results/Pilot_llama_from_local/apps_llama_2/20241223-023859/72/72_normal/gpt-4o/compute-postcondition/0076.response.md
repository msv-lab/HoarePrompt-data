The value of `row` is increased by `direction`. Given that `direction` is 1, `row` becomes `row + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `row` is `row + 1` which is between 0 and `n` (but now `row` could be equal to `n` if previously `row` was `n-1`), `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1 from its previous updated value, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0**
