Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `y` is a non-negative integer. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 3 and `direction` is -1. In all cases, `col` is increased by 1 or 2 depending on the initial values of `row`, `x`, `col`, and `y`. If the new `row` value equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and the increase in `col` is 2, otherwise the increase in `col` is 1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `x` remains the same. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 3. If `row + 1` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, then `col` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is not -1, then `row` is updated to `row + direction`. If `row + direction` equals `x` and the original value of `col` equals `y`, then `col` is increased by 1, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition with the specified changes to `row`, `col`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` based on the conditions.**
