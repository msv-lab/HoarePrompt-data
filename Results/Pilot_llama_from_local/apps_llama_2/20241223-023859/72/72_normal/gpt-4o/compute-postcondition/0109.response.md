The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1, `row` is decreased by 3, and if `row - 1 + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1, `row` is decreased by 3, and if `row - 3 + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
