The value of `row` is incremented by `direction`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `m` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1. If the new value of `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by `direction`, if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
