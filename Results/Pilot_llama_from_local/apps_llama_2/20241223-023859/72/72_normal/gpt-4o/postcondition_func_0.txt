The function calculates and prints three values related to the movement of an object within a grid of size n by m, where n and m are positive integers. The movement is determined by the number of steps k, with the object initially at position (x, y), where x and y are positive integers within the ranges 1 to n and 1 to m, respectively. The three calculated values are: max_questions, which represents the maximum number of questions that can be asked; min_questions, which represents the minimum number of questions that can be asked; and sergei_questions, which represents the number of times the object encounters its initial position. The function handles edge cases, such as when n is 1, where the object moves only horizontally, and when x is either 0 or n-1, where the object's movement is affected by the grid boundaries. The function also accounts for the object's direction of movement, which changes when it reaches the grid boundaries. The function prints the calculated values of max_questions, min_questions, and sergei_questions, providing insight into the object's movement and encounters within the grid.
