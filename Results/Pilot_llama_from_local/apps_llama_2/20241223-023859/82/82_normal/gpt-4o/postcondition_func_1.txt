The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns an integer resulting from the floor division of the product of `x` and `y` by the value returned by `func_1(x, y)`. The function's output will be an integer, but it may raise a ZeroDivisionError if `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, which is not explicitly handled in the provided code. The state of the program after the function concludes will be the returned integer value, or an error state if division by zero occurs.
