#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers, typically representing the remainders in the process of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, and `x` is the GCD of the original values of `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the original value of x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers, x and y. It modifies the input values of x and y in the process, with the final value of x being the GCD and y being 0. The function's return value is actually the GCD of the original input integers, not the original value of x as stated in the annotations. This function handles all integer inputs, including edge cases where one or both inputs are 0, and returns the mathematically correct GCD result.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns an integer resulting from the floor division of the product of `x` and `y` by the value returned by `func_1(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are non-negative integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integer parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns an integer resulting from the floor division of the product of `x` and `y` by the value returned by `func_1(x, y)`. The function's output will be an integer, but it may raise a ZeroDivisionError if `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, which is not explicitly handled in the provided code. The state of the program after the function concludes will be the returned integer value, or an error state if division by zero occurs.
