The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` are not changed by the code, but `min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`**
