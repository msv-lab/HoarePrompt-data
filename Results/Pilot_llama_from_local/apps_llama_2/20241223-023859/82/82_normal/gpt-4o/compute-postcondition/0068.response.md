`new_b` is assigned the value `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The value of `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, and `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

We know that the candidate is `k` or `diff // k`. 

If the `candidate` equals `k`, it is 3, 
so `new_b = (b + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3` which simplifies to `new_b = (b + 2) // 3 * 3`.

If the `candidate` equals `diff // k`, it is `diff // 3` where `diff` is greater than or equal to 9 (since the square root of `diff` is greater than or equal to 3), 
so `new_b = (b + diff // 3 - 1) // (diff // 3) * (diff // 3)`.

In any case, `new_b` is a multiple of `candidate` which equals either `k` or `diff // k`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
