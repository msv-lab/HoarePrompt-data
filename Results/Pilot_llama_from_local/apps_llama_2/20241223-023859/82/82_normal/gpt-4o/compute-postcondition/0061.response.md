To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the variables. The code assigns the result of the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` to the variable `current_lcm`. 

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, we need to consider how `current_lcm` is affected by these conditions.

The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` likely calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`, given the context of the variable names. Therefore, `current_lcm` will hold the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
