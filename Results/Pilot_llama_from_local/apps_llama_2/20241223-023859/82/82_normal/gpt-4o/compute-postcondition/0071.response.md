The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`. 
The value of `k` is 3, 
`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, 
`diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, 
`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, 
and `min_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, 
`diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, 
`k` is 3, 
`candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, 
`new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, 
`min_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, 
and `min_k` is either `k` or `diff // k`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_k` is either `k` or `diff // k`**
