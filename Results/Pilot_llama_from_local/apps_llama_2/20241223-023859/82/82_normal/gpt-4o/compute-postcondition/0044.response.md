`current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `func_2` is a function that calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `a` and `b` are still positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` remains conceptually needing adjustment. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` remains conceptually needing adjustment, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`**
