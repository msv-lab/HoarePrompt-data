To determine the output state, we first consider the given initial state: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`. 

The provided Python code snippet calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and assigns this value to a new variable named `diff`.

Given that `diff = abs(a - b)`, and knowing that `a` and `b` are positive integers with `a!= b`, the value of `diff` will be a positive integer representing the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. 

Since `a` and `b` can be any positive integers between `1` and `10^9` (inclusive) and are not equal, the range of possible values for `diff` can be from `1` (in the case where `a` and `b` differ by `1`, e.g., `a = 1` and `b = 2` or vice versa) up to a maximum difference of `10^9 - 1` (in the case where one is `1` and the other is `10^9`).

The initial condition that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b` remains unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify `a` or `b`. It only introduces a new variable `diff` that represents the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` equals `|a - b|`.**
