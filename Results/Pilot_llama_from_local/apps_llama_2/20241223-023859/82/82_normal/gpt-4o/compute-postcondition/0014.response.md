To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions.

The initial state is as follows:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` is 1.
- `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`.
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`.
- `min_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`.
- `min_k` equals 0.

The given code is:
```python
min_k = candidate
```
This code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`.

Given the information provided, `candidate` is not defined in the initial state or in the given code snippet. However, based on the instruction to update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code, we can conclude that the only variable affected is `min_k`, which will now hold the value of `candidate`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the changes and the initial conditions, is as follows:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` is 1.
- `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`.
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`.
- `min_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`.
- `min_k` equals `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`, `min_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`, and `min_k` equals `candidate`.**
