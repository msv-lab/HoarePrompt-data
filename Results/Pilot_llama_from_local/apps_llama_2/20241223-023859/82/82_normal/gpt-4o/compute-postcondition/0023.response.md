According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `k` and `diff`. The loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` equals `diff`, which is greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute again, the next value in the list must be different from the current value. Since the list contains only two values, `k` and `diff // k`, we need to determine which one was processed in the previous iteration.

If `k` was processed in the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `diff // k` must be a valid candidate. However, if `diff // k` was processed in the previous iteration, then for the loop to execute again, `k` must be a valid candidate.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `diff` equals `k`, and `diff` is greater than 0, then `diff // k` equals 1, because `k` equals `diff`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `candidate` must be the other value in the list, which is `diff // k` if `k` was processed, or `k` if `diff // k` was processed. 

However, we do not have information about which candidate was processed. The only thing we know is that after processing `candidate`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`.

However, we can still determine the state for the next iteration. Since the list contains two values, `k` and `diff // k`, and we know that `diff // k` equals 1, then `candidate` can only take two possible values: `k` or 1.

So, if `candidate` was `k` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `candidate` must be `diff // k`, which equals 1. And if `candidate` was `diff // k` (which equals 1) in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `candidate` must be `k`.

But since `k` equals `diff`, which is greater than 0, then after processing `candidate` equals 1, `new_a` equals `a`, `new_b` equals `b`, and `current_lcm` equals `func_2(a, b)`.

However, the problem description does not provide information about the values of `a` and `b` after the previous iteration, only that `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and the fact that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.

Therefore, we can infer the state for the next iteration as follows:

If `candidate` was `k` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `candidate` must be `diff // k`, which equals 1. 

And if `candidate` was `diff // k` (which equals 1) in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `candidate` must be `k`, and since `k` equals `diff`, which is greater than 0, then `diff` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`**
