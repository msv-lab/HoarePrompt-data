To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`.
   - `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
   - `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
   - The function `func_2` is not defined in the problem statement, but based on its usage, it presumably calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` do not change because the code only assigns a new value to `current_lcm` based on the existing values of `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `current_lcm` is assigned the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Given the initial conditions and the code's impact, the output state includes all initial conditions plus the new assignment:

- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3.
- `k` is 3.
- `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, calculated as `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
