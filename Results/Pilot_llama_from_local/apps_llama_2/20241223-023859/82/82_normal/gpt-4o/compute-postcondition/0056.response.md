Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the modified `a` and `b` values for all possible candidates, and `min_k` is the candidate that results in the minimum LCM. If `diff` is not divisible by `k`, then no modifications are made. In all cases, `k` must be less than or equal to the square root of `diff`.***
