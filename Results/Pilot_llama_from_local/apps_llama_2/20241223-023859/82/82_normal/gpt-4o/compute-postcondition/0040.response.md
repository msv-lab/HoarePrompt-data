Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`, `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` equals the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_k` equals `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their previous values.***
