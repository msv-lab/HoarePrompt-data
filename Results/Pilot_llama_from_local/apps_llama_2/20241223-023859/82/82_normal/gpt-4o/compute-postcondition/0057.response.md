According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `diff`. If `k` is less than the square root of `diff`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `diff` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 3. Additionally, since `k` must be less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, `diff` can be any value that has a square root greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and its square root must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3**
