To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the provided information and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1.
- `k` equals `diff`.
- `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
min_k = candidate
```

Impact of the code:
- The code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `min_lcm` are not changed by this operation.

Output State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1.
- `k` equals `diff`.
- `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`.
- `min_k` equals `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`, and `min_k` equals `candidate`.**
