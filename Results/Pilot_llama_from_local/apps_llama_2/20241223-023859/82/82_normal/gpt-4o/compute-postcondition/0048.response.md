According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `candidate`. The loop iterates over a list of two values: `k` and `diff // k`. At the end of the last iteration, we don't know which of these two values was the last one, but we can consider two possibilities: 

1. If `k` was the last value, for the loop to execute again, `diff // k` must not be equal to `k`. Since we know that `diff` is greater than 0 and `k` is a positive integer, we can infer that `diff // k` will be executed only if `diff` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `k` equals `diff // k`, then `k` must be equal to the square root of `diff`, which is not guaranteed. However, we do know that if `diff // k` is executed, then `candidate` equals `diff // k` at the start of the next iteration.

2. If `diff // k` was the last value, for the loop to execute again, this is the last iteration, so there is no next iteration.

Considering both possibilities, if `k` was the last value, then for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `candidate` equals `diff // k`.
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `new_a` equals `(a + diff // k - 1) // diff // k * diff // k`, `new_b` equals `(b + diff // k - 1) // diff // k * diff // k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + diff // k - 1) // diff // k * diff // k, (b + diff // k - 1) // diff // k * diff // k)`, if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `diff // k` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `diff // k`, `candidate` equals `diff // k`**
