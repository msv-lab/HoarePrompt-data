The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` are not changed by this operation. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` remains conceptually needing adjustment, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, and `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`**
