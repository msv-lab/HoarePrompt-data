The value of `new_a` is updated to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial state had `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`. 

Note that `candidate` is not defined in the initial state, so we don't know its value. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`**
