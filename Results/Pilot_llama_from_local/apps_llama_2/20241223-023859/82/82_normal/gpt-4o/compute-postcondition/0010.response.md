The given code calculates `new_b` based on the values of `b` and `candidate`. 

Since `candidate` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed that `candidate` equals `k`. 

The value of `new_b` is calculated as `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, which is the smallest multiple of `k` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` equals 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, and the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]` where `diff // k` equals `diff`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` equals 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, and the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]` where `diff // k` equals `diff`.**
