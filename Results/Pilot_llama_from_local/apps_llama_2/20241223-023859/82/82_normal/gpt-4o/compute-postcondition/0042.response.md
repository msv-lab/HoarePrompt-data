To determine the output state, we must consider the effect of the given code on the variables in the initial state.

Given the code:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```
This line adjusts the value of `new_a` based on `a` and `candidate`. However, the value of `candidate` is not provided in the initial state. 

Considering the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` could conceptually be considered as needing to be incremented or adjusted.
- `new_a` initially equals `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`.

The code only updates the value of `new_a` and does not affect `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, or `new_b` directly.

Therefore, the output state, taking into account the update of `new_a` based on the provided formula and assuming `candidate` is a known or defined value within the context (since its specific value or relation to other variables is not given), is:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` remains as it was, conceptually needing to be incremented or adjusted.
- `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` remains conceptually needing adjustment, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`.**
