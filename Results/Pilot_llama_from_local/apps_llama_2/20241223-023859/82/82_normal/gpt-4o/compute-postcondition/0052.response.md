The code `min_lcm = current_lcm` updates the value of `min_lcm` to be equal to `current_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `new_a` equals `(a + |a - b| // k - 1) // |a - b| // k * |a - b| // k`, `new_b` equals `(b + diff // k - 1) // diff // k * diff // k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`, if `current_lcm` is less than the previous `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals the previous `min_lcm` and `diff // k` is less than `min_k`, then `min_k` equals `diff // k`, `candidate` equals `diff // k`**
