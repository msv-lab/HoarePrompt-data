Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `new_a` equals `(a + |a - b| // k - 1) // |a - b| // k * |a - b| // k`, `new_b` equals `(b + diff // k - 1) // diff // k * diff // k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `diff // k` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `diff // k`, otherwise `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged, `candidate` equals `diff // k`***
