The code `min_k = candidate` assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`, and `min_k` equals `candidate`.**
