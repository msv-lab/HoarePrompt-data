Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`. If `current_lcm` is less than the initial `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals the initial `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than the initial `min_k`), then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `candidate`.***
