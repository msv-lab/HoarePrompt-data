Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.**
