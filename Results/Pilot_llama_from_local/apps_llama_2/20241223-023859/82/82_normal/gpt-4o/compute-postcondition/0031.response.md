Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the modified `a` and `b` values for all possible candidates, and `min_k` is the candidate that results in the minimum LCM, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
