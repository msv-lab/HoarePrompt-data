The value of `current_lcm` is updated to `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, 
`k` equals `diff`, 
`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`**
