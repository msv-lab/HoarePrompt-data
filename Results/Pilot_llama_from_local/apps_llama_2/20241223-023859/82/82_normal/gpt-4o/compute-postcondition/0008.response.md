To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we'll analyze the given for loop statement. The loop iterates over two values: `k` and `diff // k`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers with `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` equals 0.
- The current value of `k` is 1.
- The current value of `diff` is a multiple of `k`, meaning `diff` is divisible by 1.

For the loop to execute, we need to consider the following:
1. The loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`. Since `k` is 1, `diff // k` will always be an integer because `diff` is divisible by `k` (which is 1).
2. Given that `diff` must be greater than 0 and is a result of `|a - b|`, and since `a` and `b` are not equal, `diff` will always have a value greater than 0.
3. Since `k` is 1, `diff // k` will simply be `diff`.

Considering the initial states and the conditions for the loop to execute:
- `a` and `b` being positive integers with `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` not equal to `b` ensures `diff` is greater than 0.
- `diff` being greater than 0 and a multiple of `k` (which is 1) is naturally satisfied because any integer is a multiple of 1.
- The value of `min_lcm` being positive infinity and `min_k` being 0 does not directly impact the loop's execution but sets the stage for what the loop might be calculating or comparing.
- The current value of `k` is 1, which means the loop will iterate over `1` and `diff`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we should ensure:
- `a` and `b` are not equal, making `diff` greater than 0.
- `k` is 1, and `diff` is a multiple of `k`, which is inherently true since `k` is 1.
- The loop candidates are `k` (which is 1) and `diff // k` (which is just `diff` since `k` is 1).

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` equals 0, `k` is 1, and the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]` where `diff // k` equals `diff`**
