Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0. The current value of `k` is 1. `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k` and `new_b` equals `(b + k - 1) // k * k`. The current value of `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`. Initially, `min_lcm` is positive infinity and `min_k` equals 0. After entering the if condition, the current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.**
