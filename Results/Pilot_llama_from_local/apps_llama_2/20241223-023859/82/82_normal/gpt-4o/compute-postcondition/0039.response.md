The value of `min_k` is updated to be equal to the value of `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`, `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, `min_lcm` equals the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and if `min_lcm` equals the current value of `current_lcm`, then the current value of `candidate` is less than the previous value of `min_k`. The value of `min_k` has been updated to `candidate`, and this value is returned at the output state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`, `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, `min_lcm` equals the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_k` equals `candidate`, and if `min_lcm` equals the current value of `current_lcm`, then the current value of `candidate` is less than the previous value of `min_k`**
