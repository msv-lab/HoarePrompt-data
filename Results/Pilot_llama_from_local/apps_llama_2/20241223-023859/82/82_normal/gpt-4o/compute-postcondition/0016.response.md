According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of candidates. The list of candidates is defined as `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `diff` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, there must be another candidate in the list. Since `k` is 1, `diff // k` equals `diff`. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, the candidate must be `diff`. 
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `new_b` equals `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + diff - 1) // diff * diff, (b + diff - 1) // diff * diff)`**
