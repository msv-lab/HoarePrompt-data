Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`, `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, and `current_lcm` equals the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current value of `current_lcm` is either less than `min_lcm`, or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm`, then the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.**
