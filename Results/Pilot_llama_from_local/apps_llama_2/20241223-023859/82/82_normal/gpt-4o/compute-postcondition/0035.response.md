The new variable `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, where `candidate` is not defined in the initial state but is related to `k` and `diff`. However, since `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff` and `k` equals 2, we can infer that `candidate` might be equal to `k`. 

Assuming `candidate` equals `k`, which is 2, `new_b` equals `(b + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2` = `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2`, and `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`, and `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`**
