Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` equals 0, the current value of `k` is 1, and the current value of `diff` is a multiple of `k`, meaning `diff` is divisible by 1**
