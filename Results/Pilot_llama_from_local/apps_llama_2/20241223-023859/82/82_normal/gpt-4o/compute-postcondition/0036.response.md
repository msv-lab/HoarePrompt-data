To solve this task, let's first understand the given initial state and the code that will be executed.

Given:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` is 2.
- `new_a` equals `(a + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2`, which simplifies to `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`.
- `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

Since `func_2` is not defined in the problem, we assume it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers, `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, and `a!= b`.
- `diff = |a - b| > 0`.
- `k = 2`.
- `new_a = (a + 1) // 2 * 2`. This means `new_a` will always be an even number because it's the result of an integer division by 2 (which rounds down) and then multiplied by 2. It effectively rounds `a + 1` down to the nearest even number.
- `new_b = (b + 1) // 2 * 2`. Similar to `new_a`, `new_b` will also be an even number for the same reasons.

After executing the code:
- The value of `current_lcm` will be the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` do not change because they are not reassigned in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `new_a` equals `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` equals `(b + 1) // 2 * 2`, `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, and `current_lcm` equals the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
