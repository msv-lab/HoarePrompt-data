According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `diff`. If `diff` is at least 1, the loop can execute because the range function will have at least one value. Since `diff` equals `|a - b|` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` will always be greater than 0. 

For the loop to execute, `diff` must be greater than 0, and since `k` starts from 1, `diff` must be at least 1 for the loop body to execute at least once. Given that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, this condition is already satisfied. 

Additionally, `k` is now 1, which is the starting point of the loop. The rest of the states (`a`, `b`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`) do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` equals 0, `k` is 1**
