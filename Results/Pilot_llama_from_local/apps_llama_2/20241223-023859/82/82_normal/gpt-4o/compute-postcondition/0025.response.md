To calculate the new state after executing the given code, let's analyze the changes:

1. The code updates the value of `new_b`.
2. `new_b` is now calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which means it's rounded up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.
3. The initial state mentions `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, and `k` equals `diff`. However, the update of `new_b` uses `candidate`, not `k`.
4. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, these conditions remain unchanged.
5. The value of `new_a` was initially `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which remains unchanged by the given code snippet.
6. The value of `current_lcm` was initially `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`, which is not changed by the code snippet.

Given these points, we update `new_b` to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and acknowledge that the other variables retain their initial values or expressions.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + k - 1) // k * k, (b + k - 1) // k * k)`**
