Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff = |a - b|` and its square root is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their original values.***
