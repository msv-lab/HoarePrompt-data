To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` equals 0.
- `k` is 1.
- The loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]` where `diff // k` equals `diff`.

Given code snippet:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

However, the initial state is missing a crucial piece of information regarding the variable `candidate`. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume `candidate` is defined and is equal to `k` as per the loop iteration context.

Now, analyzing the code snippet with the assumption that `candidate` equals `k`:

- `new_a` is assigned the value of `(a + k - 1) // k * k`. This expression essentially rounds up `a` to the nearest multiple of `k`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains largely the same as the initial state, with the addition of `new_a` being defined as the result of the expression `(a + k - 1) // k * k`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` equals 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` equals `(a + k - 1) // k * k`, and the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]` where `diff // k` equals `diff`.**
