Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 1, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `candidate`.***
