To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` equals `diff`.
- `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + diff - 1) // diff * diff`.
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + diff - 1) // diff * diff, (b + diff - 1) // diff * diff)`.

Given Code:
```python
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

Impact of the Code:
- The value of `new_b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- Other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_a`, `current_lcm`) remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the given code.

Output State:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0.
- `k` equals `diff`.
- `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + diff - 1) // diff * diff, (b + diff - 1) // diff * diff)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|` and is greater than 0, `k` equals `diff`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + diff - 1) // diff * diff, (b + diff - 1) // diff * diff)`**
