`min_lcm` is assigned the value of positive infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|`, and `min_lcm` equals positive infinity.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` equals `|a - b|`, and `min_lcm` is positive infinity**
