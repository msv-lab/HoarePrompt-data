The function calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two input integers, x and y. It modifies the input values of x and y in the process, with the final value of x being the GCD and y being 0. The function's return value is actually the GCD of the original input integers, not the original value of x as stated in the annotations. This function handles all integer inputs, including edge cases where one or both inputs are 0, and returns the mathematically correct GCD result.
