#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original value of `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), not the absolute value of the original `a` as the annotations suggest. The return value is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function does not modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. The state of `a` and `b` within the function is modified during execution, but these changes do not affect the variables outside the function. The function handles all positive integer values of `a` and `b` within the specified range (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and returns their GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the floor of the division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, which is a positive integer or zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and returns the floor of the division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, handling cases where `func_1(a, b)` is zero by raising a ZeroDivisionError, since the actual code does not explicitly handle this edge case, but the floor division operator `//` in Python would raise an error in such a scenario. The final state of the program after execution will be the returned result, with no modifications made to the input variables `a` and `b`.
