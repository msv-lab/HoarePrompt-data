You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incomplete and does not fully address the problem description. It only includes two functions to calculate the greatest common divisor (`func_1`) and the least common multiple (`func_2`) of two numbers, but it does not implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`.

A correct solution would require iterating over possible values of `k`, calculating the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and keeping track of the smallest `k` that yields the smallest least common multiple. The provided program does not include this logic.

For example, if the input is `a = 6` and `b = 10`, the program should output `2` because the least common multiple of `6+2` and `10+2` is `8`, which is the smallest possible. However, the given program does not provide this output because it does not implement the necessary logic to find the optimal `k`. 

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
import math

def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x

    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // gcd(x, y)

    smallest_k = 0
    smallest_lcm = float('inf')

    for k in range(max(a, b) + 1):
        new_lcm = lcm(a + k, b + k)
        if new_lcm < smallest_lcm:
            smallest_lcm = new_lcm
            smallest_k = k

    return smallest_k
```
This implementation iterates over possible values of `k`, calculates the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and keeps track of the smallest `k` that yields the smallest least common multiple.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and returns the floor of the division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, handling cases where `func_1(a, b)` is zero by raising a ZeroDivisionError, since the actual code does not explicitly handle this edge case, but the floor division operator `//` in Python would raise an error in such a scenario. The final state of the program after execution will be the returned result, with no modifications made to the input variables `a` and `b`.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
