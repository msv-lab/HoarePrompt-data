Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment makes sense. The code only includes two functions to calculate the greatest common divisor (`func_1`) and the least common multiple (`func_2`) of two numbers, but it does not implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`. This logic is necessary to solve the problem described.

The output hints provided do not change this assessment. The hints describe the behavior of `func_2` but do not mention how the code finds the smallest `k`. The hints also assume that the input to `func_2` is valid (i.e., `a` and `b` are positive integers and `func_1(a, b)` is not zero), which is consistent with the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is accurate. The code is incomplete and does not fully address the problem description.

Final: **False**.
