Correctness: **True**

The code provided calculates the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. 

The code uses two functions: `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`.

The main part of the code starts with `k = 0` and calculates the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k`. It then increments `k` and repeats the calculation until the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is no longer less than the previous LCM. The code then prints `k - 1`, which is the smallest `k` that resulted in the smallest LCM.

The code handles all positive integer values of `a` and `b` within the specified range (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and returns the correct result. The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the code.

The code assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., `a` and `b` will be positive integers, and it does not contain any error checking to handle invalid inputs. However, since we assume that the user will always provide a valid input, this does not affect the correctness of the code.

Therefore, the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
