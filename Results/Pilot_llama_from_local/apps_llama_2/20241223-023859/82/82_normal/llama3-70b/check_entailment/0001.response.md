Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The task is to find the smallest non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. 

However, the program only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and LCM of two numbers, respectively, but does not address the core problem of finding the smallest $k$ that minimizes the LCM of $a+k$ and $b+k$. 

There is no code to explore different values of $k$, calculate the LCM of $a+k$ and $b+k$ for each $k$, and determine the smallest $k$ that yields the minimum LCM. 

For example, given the input `6 10`, the program does not have any mechanism to try different values of $k$, calculate the LCM of $6+k$ and $10+k$, and identify $k=2$ as the smallest $k$ that produces the smallest LCM of `24`. 

To solve this problem correctly, the program needs to iterate through possible values of $k$, calculate the LCM of $a+k$ and $b+k$ for each $k$, and keep track of the smallest $k$ that produces the minimum LCM found so far. 

One possible approach is to start with $k=0$ and increment $k$ until the LCM stops decreasing or a predetermined maximum value of $k$ is reached. 

Given the lack of code addressing the core problem, the provided program is incomplete and incorrect. 

Here is a basic example of what the correct code might look like:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    smallest_k = 0
    smallest_lcm = lcm(a, b)
    
    for k in range(1, min(a, b) + 1):
        new_lcm = lcm(a + k, b + k)
        if new_lcm < smallest_lcm:
            smallest_lcm = new_lcm
            smallest_k = k
            
    return smallest_k

# Read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# Find and print the smallest k
smallest_k = find_smallest_k(a, b)
print(smallest_k)
```
