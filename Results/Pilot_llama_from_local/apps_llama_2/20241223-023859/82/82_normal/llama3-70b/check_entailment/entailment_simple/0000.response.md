Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and it meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's why:

* The program correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`. This is implemented in `func_2(a, b)`.
* The program starts with `k = 0` and increments `k` in a loop, calculating the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` using `func_2(a + k, b + k)`.
* The program keeps track of the minimum LCM found so far in `min_lcm`, and updates it if it finds a smaller LCM.
* The loop breaks when the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is no longer smaller than the minimum LCM found so far. This is because the LCM will either decrease or remain the same as `k` increases, so there's no need to continue the loop once the LCM starts increasing.
* Finally, the program prints the value of `k - 1`, which is the smallest `k` that resulted in the minimum LCM.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1), the LCM will be `a * b`, and the program will correctly calculate this.
* When `a` and `b` have a common factor, the LCM will be smaller than `a * b`, and the program will correctly calculate this.
* When `k = 0` results in the minimum LCM, the program will correctly print `0`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
