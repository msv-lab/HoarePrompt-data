You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incomplete and does not fully address the problem description. It only includes two functions to calculate the greatest common divisor (`func_1`) and the least common multiple (`func_2`) of two numbers, but it does not implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`.

A correct solution would require iterating over possible values of `k`, calculating the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and keeping track of the smallest `k` that yields the smallest least common multiple. The provided program does not include this logic.

For example, if the input is `a = 6` and `b = 10`, the program should output `2` because the least common multiple of `6+2` and `10+2` is `8`, which is the smallest possible. However, the given program does not provide this output because it does not implement the necessary logic to find the optimal `k`. 

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
import math

def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x

    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // gcd(x, y)

    smallest_k = 0
    smallest_lcm = float('inf')

    for k in range(max(a, b) + 1):
        new_lcm = lcm(a + k, b + k)
        if new_lcm < smallest_lcm:
            smallest_lcm = new_lcm
            smallest_k = k

    return smallest_k
```
This implementation iterates over possible values of `k`, calculates the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and keeps track of the smallest `k` that yields the smallest least common multiple.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original value of `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), not the absolute value of the original `a` as the annotations suggest. The return value is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function does not modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. The state of `a` and `b` within the function is modified during execution, but these changes do not affect the variables outside the function. The function handles all positive integer values of `a` and `b` within the specified range (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and returns their GCD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers greater than or equal to 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the floor of the division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, which is a positive integer or zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and returns the floor of the division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, handling cases where `func_1(a, b)` is zero by raising a ZeroDivisionError, since the actual code does not explicitly handle this edge case, but the floor division operator `//` in Python would raise an error in such a scenario. The final state of the program after execution will be the returned result, with no modifications made to the input variables `a` and `b`.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
