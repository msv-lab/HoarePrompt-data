Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incomplete and does not fully address the problem description. It only includes two functions to calculate the greatest common divisor (`func_1`) and the least common multiple (`func_2`) of two numbers, but it does not implement the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k`.

A correct solution would require iterating over possible values of `k`, calculating the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and keeping track of the smallest `k` that yields the smallest least common multiple. The provided program does not include this logic.

For example, if the input is `a = 6` and `b = 10`, the program should output `2` because the least common multiple of `6+2` and `10+2` is `8`, which is the smallest possible. However, the given program does not provide this output because it does not implement the necessary logic to find the optimal `k`. 

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
import math

def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x

    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // gcd(x, y)

    smallest_k = 0
    smallest_lcm = float('inf')

    for k in range(max(a, b) + 1):
        new_lcm = lcm(a + k, b + k)
        if new_lcm < smallest_lcm:
            smallest_lcm = new_lcm
            smallest_k = k

    return smallest_k
```
This implementation iterates over possible values of `k`, calculates the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and keeps track of the smallest `k` that yields the smallest least common multiple.
