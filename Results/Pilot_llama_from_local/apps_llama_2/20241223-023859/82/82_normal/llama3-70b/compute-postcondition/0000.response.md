To calculate the output state, we need to understand what `func_1(a, b)` does, but since its definition is not provided, we will proceed based on the information given.

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers greater than or equal to 1, we are looking at the operation `a * b // func_1(a, b)`. The `//` operator in Python performs floor division, which means it divides the number before it by the number after it and returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result.

Without knowing what `func_1(a, b)` returns, we can't calculate a specific value. However, we can describe the nature of the return value based on the operation:

- `a * b` will be the product of two positive integers, which is also a positive integer.
- `func_1(a, b)`'s return value is unknown but will be used as the divisor in the floor division operation.

Therefore, the return value of the expression will be the floor of the division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, and assuming `func_1(a, b)` also returns a positive integer (given the context of the division operation), the result will be a positive integer or zero, depending on the relative magnitudes of `a * b` and `func_1(a, b)`.

Output State: **The program returns the floor of the division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, which is a positive integer or zero.**
