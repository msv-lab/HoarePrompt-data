The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, the function returns the floor of the division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, where `func_1(a, b)` is a positive integer or zero. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the floor of the division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, both positive integers greater than or equal to 1, and returns the floor of the division of their product by the result of func_1(a, b).**
