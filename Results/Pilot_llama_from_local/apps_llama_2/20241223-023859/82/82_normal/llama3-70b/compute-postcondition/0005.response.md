The code `a, b = b, a % b` assigns the old value of `b` to `a` and the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b` to `b`. 

Given that `a` is the old value of `b` and `b` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, let's denote the old values of `a` and `b` as `old_a` and `old_b` respectively. We have `a = old_b` and `b = old_a % old_b`.

After executing the code, `a` becomes `b` which is `old_a % old_b` and `b` becomes `a % b` which is `old_b % (old_a % old_b)`.

So, the new value of `a` is `old_a % old_b` and the new value of `b` is `old_b % (old_a % old_b)`.

Since both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and given that `a` is the old value of `b` and `b` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, the new values of `a` and `b` are also positive integers.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the old value of `b` divided by the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9.

Output State: **`a` is `old_a % old_b`, `b` is `old_b % (old_a % old_b)`, both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9**
