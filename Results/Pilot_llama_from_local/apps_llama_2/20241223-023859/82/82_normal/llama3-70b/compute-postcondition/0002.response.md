Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both greater than or equal to 1, and returns the floor of the division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, handling cases where `func_1(a, b)` is zero by raising a ZeroDivisionError, since the actual code does not explicitly handle this edge case, but the floor division operator `//` in Python would raise an error in such a scenario. The final state of the program after execution will be the returned result, with no modifications made to the input variables `a` and `b`.**
