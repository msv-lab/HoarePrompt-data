To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is the old value of `b`.
   - `b` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b` and is non-zero.
   - Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= new `a`, new `b` <= 10^9.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The line `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`.
   - The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
   - The new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`.

Given the initial conditions and the nature of the update, we can see that:
- The new `a` is indeed the old `b`, which was previously the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`. However, since `a` now takes the value of the old `b`, and given that the old `b` was a non-zero remainder, the new `a` is also non-zero and a positive integer.
- The new `b` is the remainder of the old `a` (which is now `b`) divided by the old `b` (which is now `a`). This operation essentially continues the process of finding remainders, similar to the steps in the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Given these observations, the conditions that both `a` and `b` are positive integers and 1 <= new `a`, new `b` <= 10^9 still hold because the operation of taking a remainder (with non-zero `b`) will always yield a value less than or equal to the divisor (`b` in this case), ensuring the values stay within the specified bounds.

**Output State**: **`a` is the old value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**
