Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), not the absolute value of the original `a` as the annotations suggest. The return value is the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function does not modify the original values of `a` and `b` outside of the function scope. The state of `a` and `b` within the function is modified during execution, but these changes do not affect the variables outside the function. The function handles all positive integer values of `a` and `b` within the specified range (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) and returns their GCD.**
