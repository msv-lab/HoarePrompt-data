You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for modifying the program state so that the next iteration of the `while` loop can proceed. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the `while` loop statement. If it is a `while True` loop or if the loop can certainly execute one more time, please simply repeat the program state at the end of the previous iteration. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10,  `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3.
```
while i < n:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. `n` being greater than 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4,  `n` must be greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0,  students is 3 less than its initial value.
```
while students >=1 :
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable students.  If students is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, students is 3 less than its initial value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the initial value of students needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and students currently must be greater than 1.
State: **`total` is 0, students is 3 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is the old value of `b`.
   - `b` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b` and is non-zero.
   - Both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= new `a`, new `b` <= 10^9.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The line `a, b = b, a % b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`.
   - The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
   - The new value of `b` becomes the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`.

Given the initial conditions and the nature of the update, we can see that:
- The new `a` is indeed the old `b`, which was previously the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`. However, since `a` now takes the value of the old `b`, and given that the old `b` was a non-zero remainder, the new `a` is also non-zero and a positive integer.
- The new `b` is the remainder of the old `a` (which is now `b`) divided by the old `b` (which is now `a`). This operation essentially continues the process of finding remainders, similar to the steps in the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Given these observations, the conditions that both `a` and `b` are positive integers and 1 <= new `a`, new `b` <= 10^9 still hold because the operation of taking a remainder (with non-zero `b`) will always yield a value less than or equal to the divisor (`b` in this case), ensuring the values stay within the specified bounds.

**Output State**: **`a` is the old value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9.**
```
while b:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
