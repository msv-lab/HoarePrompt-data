Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program starts with 0 stones and then performs the operations. However, the problem description asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations, considering that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

The program does not consider the case where the initial number of stones is more than 0 and the operations are performed in such a way that the minimal possible number of stones is achieved. For example, if the input is 3 and the operations are "--+", the program will output 0, but if Vasya had 1 stone initially, the minimal possible number of stones after the operations would be 1, not 0.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible initial numbers of stones and find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations, while ensuring that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

Here's an example of how the program can be modified to achieve this:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    for initial_stones in range(1, n + 1):
        stones = initial_stones
        valid = True
        for operation in s:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                if stones > 0:
                    stones -= 1
                else:
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            min_stones = min(min_stones, stones)
    print(min_stones)
```

This modified program iterates over all possible initial numbers of stones, performs the operations, and keeps track of the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile while ensuring that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.
