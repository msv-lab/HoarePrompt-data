Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the initialization of the `stones` variable. The problem description states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. However, the program initializes `stones` to 0, which means it assumes the pile is empty at the beginning.

A correct implementation should consider the minimum number of stones required to perform all the operations without the pile being empty before each operation of taking one stone. This can be achieved by maintaining a count of the minimum number of stones required to perform all the '-' operations, and then adding the number of '+' operations to this count.

For example, given the input `3` and `---`, the program outputs `0`, which is correct. However, given the input `2` and `--`, the program outputs `0`, but the correct output should be `2`, because the pile must have had at least 2 stones at the beginning to perform both '-' operations.

To fix this, the program should count the number of '-' operations and initialize the `stones` variable to this count, rather than 0. Then, it can process the string as before, incrementing `stones` for each '+' operation and decrementing it for each '-' operation, ensuring that `stones` does not go below 0. 

The corrected code should look something like this:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = s.count('-')
    stones = min_stones
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones -= 1
    print(max(0, stones))
```
This code correctly implements the problem description for every potential case.
