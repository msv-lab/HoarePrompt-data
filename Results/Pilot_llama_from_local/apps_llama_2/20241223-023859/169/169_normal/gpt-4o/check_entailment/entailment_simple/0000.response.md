Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1.  **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the number of operations (`n`) and the sequence of operations (`s`) from the input.

2.  **Iteration Over Operations**: It then iterates over each operation in the sequence (`s`). For each operation, it increments the `stones` variable if the operation is '+' (add a stone) and decrements it if the operation is '-' (remove a stone). The `max(0, stones - 1)` ensures that the number of stones never goes below 0, which aligns with the problem description where it's stated that "The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile."

3.  **Final Output**: After processing all operations, the program prints the final number of stones.

The key insight is that the program simulates the operations as if they were being performed on a pile of stones, adhering to the rule that you cannot remove a stone if the pile is empty. By initializing `stones` to 0 and not decreasing it below 0, the program effectively finds the minimum number of stones that could be in the pile after these operations, as required by the problem description. 

This approach works because it considers the net effect of all operations, ensuring that the pile is never empty when trying to remove a stone, thus simulating the condition that Vasya can only remove stones if the pile is not empty. The provided examples demonstrate this logic in action, further validating the program's correctness.
