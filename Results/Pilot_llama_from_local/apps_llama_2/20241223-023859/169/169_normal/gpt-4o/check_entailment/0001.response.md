Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it starts with 0 stones in the pile, but it doesn't consider the minimum number of stones required at the beginning to perform the given operations. According to the problem description, the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. The program doesn't account for this condition.

For example, if the input is 3 and the operations are "---", the program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is 3 and the operations are "--+", the program will correctly output 0, but the assumption is that the pile had at least 2 stones at the beginning to perform the two "take" operations.

A correct program should consider the minimum number of stones required at the beginning to perform the given operations. It should iterate over the range of possible initial stone counts, perform the operations, and keep track of the minimum final stone count. 

The given code provided does provide the correct result for the problem given in the prompt as it starts at 0 and only adds or takes away based on the minumum required stones for pile to be non-empty, but for more complex test cases or problem descriptions where initial stone count could be any number above 0, this simple function does not apply.
