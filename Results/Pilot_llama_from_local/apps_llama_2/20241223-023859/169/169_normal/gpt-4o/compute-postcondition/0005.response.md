The code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1. Initially, `stones` is 0, so after the increment, `stones` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

The value of `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is still an input string with at least 1 character, and `operation` remains '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 1 character, `operation` is '+', `stones` is 1**
