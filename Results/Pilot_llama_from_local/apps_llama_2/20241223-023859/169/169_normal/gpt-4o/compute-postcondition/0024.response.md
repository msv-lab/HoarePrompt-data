Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer $n$ and a string $s$ of length $n$ containing '-' and '+' characters, and it calculates the final count of stones after processing the string based on the operations represented by the characters, where '+' increments the stone count and '-' decrements it, ensuring the count does not go below 0. The function then prints this final stone count. The final state of the program after it concludes includes the input integer $n$ and string $s$ being consumed, and the final stone count being printed to the standard output.**
