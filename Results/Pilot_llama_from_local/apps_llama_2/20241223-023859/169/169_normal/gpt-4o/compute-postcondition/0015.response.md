Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters. If the second character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 2 and `operation` is '+'. If the second character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is '-'. If the second character of `s` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is the second character of `s`, except when the second character of `s` is '+' which is already handled, but for any other character that is not '+' or '-', it will follow the rule that `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the second character of `s`. However, a more concise way to express this is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters. If the second character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 2. If the second character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0. For any other character, `stones` is 1 if the operation was '+' before the if statement, and 0 otherwise, and `operation` is the second character of `s`.**
