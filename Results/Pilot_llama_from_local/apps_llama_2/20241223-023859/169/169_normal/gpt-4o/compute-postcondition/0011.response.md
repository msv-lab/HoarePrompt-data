According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` has at least 1 character. Since one character has been processed, for the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 2 characters. The first character of `s` has been processed, so the next character will be the new first character. 

If the new first character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is '+'. If the new first character of `s` is not '+', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the new first character of `s`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, if the second character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is '+'. If the second character of `s` is not '+', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the second character of `s`.**
