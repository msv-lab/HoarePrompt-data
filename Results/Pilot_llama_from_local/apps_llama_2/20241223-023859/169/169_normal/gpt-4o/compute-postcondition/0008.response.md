The code `stones = max(0, stones - 1)` decrements the value of `stones` by 1, but not below 0. Since the initial value of `stones` is 0, the value of `stones` remains 0 after executing this code. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0, the first character in the string `s` has been assigned to `operation` and the current value of `operation` is '-'**
