The code `s = input()` assigns the input string to the variable `s`. The previous value of `n` is still valid, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The input for the string `s` is no longer pending and has been accepted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string**
