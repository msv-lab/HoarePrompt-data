To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters.
2. The conditions for `stones` and `operation` are based on the second character of `s`. If the second character is '+', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is '+'. If the second character is not '+', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the second character of `s`.
3. The given code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1.

Considering these points:

- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code.
- The value of `s` also remains unchanged for the same reason.
- The conditions for `stones` and `operation` were initially dependent on the second character of `s`, but since `stones` is incremented by 1, its new value will be either 1 + 1 = 2 (if the second character of `s` is '+') or 0 + 1 = 1 (if the second character of `s` is not '+').
- The value of `operation` does not change because the code does not modify it; it remains either '+' (if the second character of `s` is '+') or the second character of `s` (if it's not '+').

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code is as follows:

- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters.
- If the second character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 2 and `operation` is '+'.
- If the second character of `s` is not '+', then `stones` is 1 and `operation` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 2 characters, if the second character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 2 and `operation` is '+', else `stones` is 1 and `operation` is the second character of `s`.**
