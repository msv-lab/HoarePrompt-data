To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `stones` depends on the third character of `s`, and `operation` is the third character of `s`.

2. The code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1.

Given that `stones` depends on the third character of `s` (which is also equal to `operation`), after the increment operation, `stones` will be one more than its previous value based on the third character of `s`.

Since the exact dependency of `stones` on the third character of `s` is not specified, we can only conclude that `stones` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, which was determined by `s`'s third character.

The states of `n`, `s`, and `operation` are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character of `s`, and `stones` is the previous value of `stones` (which depended on the third character of `s`) incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character of `s`, and `stones` is `stones + 1`**
