The provided code snippet is a print statement that outputs the value of `stones`. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it only displays the current value of `stones`. 

The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `operation` is the last character of `s`, and `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' in `s`. After executing the print statement, these conditions remain unchanged because the print operation does not modify any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value of `stones` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `operation` is the last character of `s`, `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' in `s`, and the value of `stones` has been returned and printed.**
