Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character of `s`. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is increased by 1. If `operation` is '-', then `stones` is either 0 or decreased by 1 from its initial value depending on its initial state, ensuring `stones` is at least 0. If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then the state of `n`, `s`, `operation`, and `stones` remains as described in the precondition, with no changes made to `stones`.***
