According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again for the second character. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` has at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters and `operation` is the third character of `s`. The value of `stones` is determined by the value of `operation`. If the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is 2. If the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0. For any other character, `stones` is 1 if the operation was '+' before the if statement, and 0 otherwise.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `stones` depends on the third character of `s`, `operation` is the third character of `s`**
