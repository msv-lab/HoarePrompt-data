To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given code and output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over each character `operation` in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if the character is '+' or '-'. If it's '+', it increments `stones` by 1. If it's '-', it decrements `stones` by 1 but ensures `stones` does not go below 0 by using `max(0, stones - 1)`.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

1. `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop as it is not modified within the loop.
2. `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations the loop has executed.
3. `operation` takes the value of the current character being processed in the string `s`.
4. `stones` increases by 1 for each '+' encountered and decreases by 1 for each '-' encountered, but never goes below 0.

Considering these patterns and the loop's behavior, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `n` will still be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as it is not modified by the loop.
- `s` will be the same input string, but the loop will have processed all its characters.
- `operation` will be the last character of `s`, as the loop iterates over each character in `s`.
- `stones` will be the result of incrementing by 1 for each '+' in `s` and decrementing by 1 for each '-' in `s`, without going below 0. Essentially, `stones` will be the net count of '+' operations minus '-' operations, or 0 if this net count is negative.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `operation` is the last character of `s`, and `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' in `s`.**
