## Step 1: Determine the input parameters of the function.
The function accepts input through the standard input, which consists of a positive integer $n$ and a string $s$ of length $n$ containing only '-' and '+' characters.

## Step 2: Understand the constraints on the input parameters.
The integer $n$ is constrained to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the string $s$ is of the same length as $n$, containing only '-' and '+' characters.

## Step 3: Analyze the output of the function based on the given constraints and relationships.
Although the specific output of the function is not provided in the problem statement, we can infer that the function will process the string $s$ based on the operations represented by '-' and '+' characters, likely performing some form of calculation or transformation.

## Step 4: Describe the functionality of the function based on the input parameters and output.
Given the lack of specific details on the output, we focus on what the function accepts: a positive integer $n$ and a string $s$ of the same length containing '-' and '+' characters. The function's purpose appears to be processing this string according to the operations indicated by the characters in $s$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{The function accepts a positive integer $n$ and a string $s$ of length $n$ containing '-' and '+' characters, and it processes the string based on the operations represented by the characters.}$
