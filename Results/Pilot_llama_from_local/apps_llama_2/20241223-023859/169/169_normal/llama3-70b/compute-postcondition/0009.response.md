The function `func` accepts two parameters, an integer `n` and a string `s`. `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (1 <= n <= 100). `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters. 

However, the provided function definition is `def func():` which does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, it seems like the function should be `def func(n, s):` to accept the specified parameters.

After executing the function body, the return value is not explicitly stated in the problem description. Therefore, I will describe the functionality based on the general understanding of the input parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and s, where n is an integer between 1 and 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of '+' and '-' characters, but the return value is not specified in the problem description.**
