The given Python code snippet is `print(0)`. This code prints the value 0 to the console. 

The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The current value of `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, and the current value of `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`. The number of '-' characters in `s` is greater than the number of '+' characters in `s`, meaning `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`.

After executing `print(0)`, the values of `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` do not change because `print(0)` does not modify these variables. 

However, the value 0 is printed to the console and returned to the output. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`, `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, and the value 0 has been printed and returned to the output.**
