The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that the input to the function consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters.

The value of `n` is now an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the string `s` is still of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, but its exact value is not yet determined.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and there is a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters.**
