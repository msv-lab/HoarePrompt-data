Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`. If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, the value 0 has been printed and returned to the output. Otherwise, the value of `n - 2 * minus_count` has been returned and printed.**
