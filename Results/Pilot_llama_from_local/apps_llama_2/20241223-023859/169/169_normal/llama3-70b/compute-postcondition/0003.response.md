The code `plus_count = s.count('+')` assigns the count of '+' characters in string `s` to the variable `plus_count`. 

Given that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, and `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, we can infer that `plus_count` will be equal to `n - minus_count` since the string `s` only consists of '+' and '-' characters.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, and `plus_count` is the number of '+' characters in `s`, which is equal to `n - minus_count`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`.**
