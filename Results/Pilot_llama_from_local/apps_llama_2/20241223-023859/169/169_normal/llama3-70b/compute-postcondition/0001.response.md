The value of `s` is updated to be the input string, but the length of `s` is still `n` because `n` is defined as the length of `s` and `n` remains unchanged. However, since `s` is now an actual input string, we can confirm it consists of '+' and '-' characters and its length is `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is an input string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters.**
