Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The current value of `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, and the current value of `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`. The number of '-' characters in `s` is greater than the number of '+' characters in `s`, meaning `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`.**
