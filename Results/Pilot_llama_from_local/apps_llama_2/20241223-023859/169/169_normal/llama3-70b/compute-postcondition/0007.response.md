The value of `plus_count - minus_count` is printed. Given that `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count` and `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s` and less than or equal to `plus_count`, `plus_count - minus_count` equals `n - minus_count - minus_count` which equals `n - 2 * minus_count`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is still an input string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is still the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is still equal to `n - minus_count`. The value `n - 2 * minus_count` has been returned and printed at the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is an input string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` equals `n - minus_count`, `n - 2 * minus_count` has been returned and printed**
