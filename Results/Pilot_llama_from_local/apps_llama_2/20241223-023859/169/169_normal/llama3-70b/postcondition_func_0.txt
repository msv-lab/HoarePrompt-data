The function calculates and prints the final number of stones in a pile, given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of '+' and '-' characters representing adding or removing stones from the pile. The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. After execution, the program state reflects that it has processed the input string, counted the occurrences of '+' and '-' characters, and printed the resulting number of stones. If the number of '-' characters exceeds the number of '+' characters, the function prints 0, indicating an empty pile; otherwise, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the final number of stones in the pile. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (100), and when the string `s` is entirely composed of either '+' or '-' characters, or any combination thereof. The final state of the program includes the side effect of printing the outcome to the console, and the variables `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` hold the respective input length, input string, and counts of '-' and '+' characters.
