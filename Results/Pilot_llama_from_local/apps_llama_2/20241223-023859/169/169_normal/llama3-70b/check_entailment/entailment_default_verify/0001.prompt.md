You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct based on the provided problem description. The program works by counting the number of '-' and '+' operations. If the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, it prints 0, indicating that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations can be 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the number of '+' operations and '-' operations, which represents the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if all operations are '+', it correctly prints the total number of '+' operations. If all operations are '-', it correctly prints 0. If there is a mix of '+' and '-' operations, it correctly calculates the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations is achieved when the number of '-' operations is maximized and the number of '+' operations is minimized, or vice versa, while ensuring that the pile is never empty before a '-' operation. The program's approach of simply counting the number of '+' and '-' operations and calculating their difference is sufficient to handle this logic and produce the correct output.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints the final number of stones in a pile, given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of '+' and '-' characters representing adding or removing stones from the pile. The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. After execution, the program state reflects that it has processed the input string, counted the occurrences of '+' and '-' characters, and printed the resulting number of stones. If the number of '-' characters exceeds the number of '+' characters, the function prints 0, indicating an empty pile; otherwise, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the final number of stones in the pile. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (100), and when the string `s` is entirely composed of either '+' or '-' characters, or any combination thereof. The final state of the program includes the side effect of printing the outcome to the console, and the variables `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` hold the respective input length, input string, and counts of '-' and '+' characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
