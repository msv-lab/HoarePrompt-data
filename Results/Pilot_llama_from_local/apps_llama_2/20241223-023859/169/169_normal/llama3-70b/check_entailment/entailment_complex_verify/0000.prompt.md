You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. $n$ times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given $n$ operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one positive integer $n$ — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya ($1 \leq n \leq 100$).

The next line contains the string $s$, consisting of $n$ symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on $i$-th operation, $s_i$ is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, $s_i$ is equal to "+" (without quotes).


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these $n$ operations.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
---

Output
0
Input
4
++++

Output
4
Input
2
-+

Output
1
Input
5
++-++

Output
3


-----Note-----

In the first test, if Vasya had $3$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $0$. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is $0$. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than $3$, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).

In the second test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $4$. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making $4$ operations the number of stones in the pile increases on $4$ stones. So, the answer is $4$.

In the third test, if Vasya had $1$ stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $1$. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.

In the fourth test, if Vasya had $0$ stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to $3$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if minus_count > plus_count:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(plus_count - minus_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to handle all the possible cases correctly. It takes the number of operations `n` and the string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' as input. Then, it counts the number of '-' and '+' operations in the string.

The logic of the program is to subtract the number of '-' operations from the number of '+' operations to find the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations. If the result is negative (i.e., there are more '-' operations than '+' operations), it prints 0, because in this case, Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as the number of '-' operations.

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and seems to work correctly for all possible inputs. There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the program that would cause it to produce incorrect results. 

For instance, consider the case where the input is `3` and the string is `---`. In this case, the program correctly outputs `0`, because Vasya must have started with at least 3 stones to be able to remove 3 stones.

Another case is when the input is `4` and the string is `++++`. The program correctly outputs `4`, because Vasya adds 4 stones to the pile, resulting in a total of 4 stones.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected for all the provided examples and possible edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input to the function consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 100) and a string s of length n, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, where '+' represents adding a stone to the pile and '-' represents taking a stone from the pile.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    if (minus_count > plus_count) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(plus_count - minus_count)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`. If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, the value 0 has been printed and returned to the output. Otherwise, the value of `n - 2 * minus_count` has been returned and printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the final number of stones in a pile, given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` consists of '+' and '-' characters representing adding or removing stones from the pile. The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. After execution, the program state reflects that it has processed the input string, counted the occurrences of '+' and '-' characters, and printed the resulting number of stones. If the number of '-' characters exceeds the number of '+' characters, the function prints 0, indicating an empty pile; otherwise, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the final number of stones in the pile. The function handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (100), and when the string `s` is entirely composed of either '+' or '-' characters, or any combination thereof. The final state of the program includes the side effect of printing the outcome to the console, and the variables `n`, `s`, `minus_count`, and `plus_count` hold the respective input length, input string, and counts of '-' and '+' characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
