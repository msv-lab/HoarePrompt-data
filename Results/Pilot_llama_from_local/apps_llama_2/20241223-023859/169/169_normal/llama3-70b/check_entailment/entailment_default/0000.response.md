Correctness: **True**

The code appears to correctly solve the problem as stated. It calculates the number of stones added (represented by '+' characters) and the number of stones removed (represented by '-' characters) and prints the final number of stones in the pile.

The key insight here is that the minimum number of stones in the pile after the operations can be achieved by assuming that Vasya starts with the minimum number of stones necessary to perform the operations without running out of stones. This minimum number of stones is equal to the number of '-' characters if the number of '-' characters exceeds the number of '+' characters. Otherwise, it is 0, since Vasya can start with no stones and add stones as needed.

The code correctly handles this case by printing 0 if the number of '-' characters exceeds the number of '+' characters, and printing the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters otherwise.

All the examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code:

- For the input "3" and "---", the code prints "0", which is correct.
- For the input "4" and "++++", the code prints "4", which is correct.
- For the input "2" and "-+", the code prints "1", which is correct.
- For the input "5" and "++-++", the code prints "3", which is correct.

Overall, the code seems to correctly solve the problem for all possible cases, assuming that the input is valid and does not cause any errors in the program.
