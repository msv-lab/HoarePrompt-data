Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input `n` and `s` as specified in the problem description.
2. It counts the number of '-' and '+' characters in the string `s` using the `count()` method.
3. If the number of '-' characters is greater than the number of '+' characters, it prints 0, which is correct according to the problem description. This is because the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after making these operations is 0, as Vasya cannot take more stones than are available.
4. If the number of '-' characters is not greater than the number of '+' characters, it prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `plus_count - minus_count`. This is also correct, as it represents the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after making these operations.

The program handles all possible cases and follows the problem description. The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program is also reasonable, as specified in the problem statement.

To further explain why this program works:

- The key insight is that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after making these operations is determined by the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
- If there are more '-' characters than '+' characters, it means that Vasya has taken more stones than he has added. In this case, the minimum possible number of stones in the pile is 0, as Vasya cannot take more stones than are available.
- If there are not more '-' characters than '+' characters, it means that Vasya has added at least as many stones as he has taken. In this case, the minimum possible number of stones in the pile is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Overall, the program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
