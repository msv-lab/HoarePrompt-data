Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates and prints the final number of stones in a pile, given an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, consisting of '+' and '-' characters representing adding or removing stones from the pile.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Counting '+' and '-' characters**: The program correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` using the `count` method.

2. **Handling the case where `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`**: When `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, it means that the number of stones removed is more than the number of stones added. In this case, the program correctly prints 0, indicating that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations is 0. This is because Vasya can start with a number of stones equal to the number of '-' operations, and after performing all the operations, the pile will be empty.

3. **Handling the case where `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`**: When `minus_count` is less than or equal to `plus_count`, it means that the number of stones removed is less than or equal to the number of stones added. In this case, the program correctly prints the difference between `plus_count` and `minus_count`, representing the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

The program correctly handles all potential edge cases, including when `n` is at its minimum (1) or maximum (100), and when the string `s` is entirely composed of either '+' or '-' characters, or any combination thereof.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and correctly calculates the final number of stones in a pile after a series of operations.
