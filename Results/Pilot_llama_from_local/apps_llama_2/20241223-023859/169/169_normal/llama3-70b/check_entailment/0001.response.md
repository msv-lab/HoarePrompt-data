Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct based on the provided problem description. The program works by counting the number of '-' and '+' operations. If the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, it prints 0, indicating that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations can be 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the number of '+' operations and '-' operations, which represents the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

The program handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if all operations are '+', it correctly prints the total number of '+' operations. If all operations are '-', it correctly prints 0. If there is a mix of '+' and '-' operations, it correctly calculates the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations.

The program's logic is based on the fact that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after the operations is achieved when the number of '-' operations is maximized and the number of '+' operations is minimized, or vice versa, while ensuring that the pile is never empty before a '-' operation. The program's approach of simply counting the number of '+' and '-' operations and calculating their difference is sufficient to handle this logic and produce the correct output.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
