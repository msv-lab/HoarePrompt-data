Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to handle all the possible cases correctly. It takes the number of operations `n` and the string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' as input. Then, it counts the number of '-' and '+' operations in the string.

The logic of the program is to subtract the number of '-' operations from the number of '+' operations to find the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations. If the result is negative (i.e., there are more '-' operations than '+' operations), it prints 0, because in this case, Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as the number of '-' operations.

The program correctly handles all the provided examples and seems to work correctly for all possible inputs. There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the program that would cause it to produce incorrect results. 

For instance, consider the case where the input is `3` and the string is `---`. In this case, the program correctly outputs `0`, because Vasya must have started with at least 3 stones to be able to remove 3 stones.

Another case is when the input is `4` and the string is `++++`. The program correctly outputs `4`, because Vasya adds 4 stones to the pile, resulting in a total of 4 stones.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected for all the provided examples and possible edge cases.
