Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the logic to determine the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after a series of operations. It correctly counts the occurrences of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`, representing adding and removing stones, respectively.

The logic to print the final number of stones is also correct. If the number of '-' characters (removals) exceeds the number of '+' characters (additions), it prints 0, indicating an empty pile. This is because, as described in the problem, the pile cannot be empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile, so if removals exceed additions, the minimum possible stones left will be 0 (considering the case where the initial number of stones equals the number of removals).

In all other cases, where the number of '+' characters is greater than or equal to the number of '-' characters, it correctly prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, representing the net change in the number of stones and thus the minimum possible number of stones left after the operations.

Given the problem's constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and the nature of the input (a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters), the code handles all potential edge cases correctly, including when `n` is at its minimum or maximum, and when the string `s` is entirely composed of either '+' or '-' characters, or any combination thereof.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code:

- Input: `3`, `---`, Output: `0`
- Input: `4`, ` ++++`, Output: `4`
- Input: `2`, ` -+`, Output: `1`
- Input: `5`, `++-++`, Output: `3`

Each of these examples demonstrates the code's ability to correctly calculate the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after the series of operations, in accordance with the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct for every potential case described in the problem.
