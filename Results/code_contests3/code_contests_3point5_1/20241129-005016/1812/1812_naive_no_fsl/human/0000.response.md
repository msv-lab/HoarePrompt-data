Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch based on the provided problem description. The program first reads the input which consists of the row number and seat letter of Vasya. Then it calculates the total number of rows N and the seat position C.

The program then follows the algorithm described in the problem statement to determine the total time Vasya has to wait. It correctly handles the movement of the flight attendants in rows and the order of serving passengers. The formula used in the program accurately calculates the time based on the row number and seat position of Vasya.

After reviewing the program and the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases and follows the requirements specified in the problem statement.
