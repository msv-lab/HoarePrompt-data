Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly calculates the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch based on the provided problem description. The program first reads the input which consists of the row number and seat letter of Vasya. Then, it calculates the total number of rows to be served before Vasya's row, the position of Vasya within the row, and the movement pattern of the attendants.

The program then uses these values to determine the total time it will take for Vasya to get his lunch. It considers the movement of the attendants, the position of Vasya within the row, and adds up the time taken for each row serving and movement accordingly.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be concluded that the program works correctly for all potential cases and follows the requirements specified in the problem statement.
