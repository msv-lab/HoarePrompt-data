Example Answer:
The value of `N` is extracted from `s`, and the value of `C` is calculated as the ASCII value of the seat character in `s` minus 97. Then, `M` is assigned the result of `(N - 1) bitwise AND 3`. The value of `M` will be a number between 0 and 3 based on the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is represented as `ns`, N is the row number extracted from `s`, C is the ASCII value of the seat character in `s` minus 97, M is a number between 0 and 3.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as `ns`, N is the row number extracted from `s`, C is the ASCII value of the seat character in `s` minus 97, M is a number between 0 and 3**
