Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read a line from the standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The variable `r` is assigned the lambda function with `sys.stdin.readline()` as the default argument. Since no input is provided, the program does not change the initial state of Vasya's seat representation.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f').**
