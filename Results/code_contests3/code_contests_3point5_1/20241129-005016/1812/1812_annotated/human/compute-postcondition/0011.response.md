The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the seat number for Vasya based on the provided constraints. Vasya's seat is represented as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return Vasya's seat number based on the constraints given.
