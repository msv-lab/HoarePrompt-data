Example Answer:
N is assigned the integer value obtained by taking all characters from the start up to the second last character of S. Since S represents the seat in Vasya's row number, the row number is extracted by removing the last character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'). The value of N is the row number obtained from S. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is represented as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'). s is assigned the input value, N is the row number extracted from s.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'). s is assigned the input value, N is the row number extracted from s**
