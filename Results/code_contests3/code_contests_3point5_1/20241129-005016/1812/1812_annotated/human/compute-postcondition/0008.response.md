Example Answer:
Initially, Vasya's seat is represented as `ns`, N is the row number extracted from `s` minus M, C is the ASCII value of the seat character in `s` minus 97, and M is the result of XOR operation with 3. After running the code `N += M`, N is incremented by the value of M. Since M is the result of XOR operation with 3, M can be either 2 or 1. Therefore, the new state is: Vasya's seat is represented as `ns`, N is the row number extracted from `s` minus either 2 or 1, C is the ASCII value of the seat character in `s` minus 97, M is either 2 or 1.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is represented as `ns`, N is the row number extracted from `s` minus either 2 or 1, C is the ASCII value of the seat character in `s` minus 97, M is either 2 or 1**
