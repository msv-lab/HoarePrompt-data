Example Answer:
`M` is assigned the value of `N - 1 & 3`. The value of `N` is a positive integer extracted from the input string, so `N - 1` would be one less than that positive integer. Then the bitwise AND operation with 3 is performed. The result of `N - 1` & 3 can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer extracted from the input string, `C` is the result of the subtraction operation, `M` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer extracted from the input string, `C` is the result of the subtraction operation, `M` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3**
