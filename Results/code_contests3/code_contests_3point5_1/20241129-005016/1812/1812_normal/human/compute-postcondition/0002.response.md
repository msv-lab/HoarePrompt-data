Example Answer:
The variable `N` is assigned the integer value extracted from the input string `S` by slicing the string from the beginning till the second last character. Since the input string consists of a positive integer followed by a character, `N` will hold the positive integer value extracted. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer extracted from the input string.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer extracted from the input string**
