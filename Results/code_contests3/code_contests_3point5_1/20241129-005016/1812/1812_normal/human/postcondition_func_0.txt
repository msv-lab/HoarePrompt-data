The function `func` reads a string input consisting of a positive integer `n` representing the row number and a character `s` representing the seat in the row. It then performs calculations based on these inputs to determine a result without returning any value. The calculations involve operations on `N`, `C`, and `M`, and the final result is printed. The function does not have explicit return statements, and the postconditions do not accurately reflect the behavior of the code.
