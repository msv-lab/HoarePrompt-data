Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of seconds Vasya has to wait until he gets his lunch based on the given row number and seat in the row. The program first extracts the row number and seat character from the input. Then it calculates the position of Vasya relative to the flight attendants' serving pattern. It handles the cases where Vasya's row number is adjusted based on the position within the serving pattern. Finally, it calculates the total number of seconds Vasya needs to wait before getting lunch and prints the result.

The program follows the problem description by correctly implementing the logic of the flight attendants' serving pattern and Vasya's position within that pattern. It accounts for the movement of the attendants every two rows, the order of serving passengers, and the time it takes to serve and move rows. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases and accurately determines the waiting time for Vasya.
