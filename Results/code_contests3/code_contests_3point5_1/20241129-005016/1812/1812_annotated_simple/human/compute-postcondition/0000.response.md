Example Answer:
The lambda function `gets` is defined to read input from `sys.stdin.readline` and strip any leading or trailing whitespaces. The function is not called, so it does not affect the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f').
Output State: **Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f').**
