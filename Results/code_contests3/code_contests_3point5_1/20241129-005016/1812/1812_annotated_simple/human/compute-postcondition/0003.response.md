Example Answer:
`C` is assigned the value of the ASCII value of the last character of `S` (which represents the seat) minus the ASCII value of 'a'. Since 'a' has an ASCII value of 97, and the seat can be any of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f', the possible values of `C` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'); N is the extracted row number from the seat description, C can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
