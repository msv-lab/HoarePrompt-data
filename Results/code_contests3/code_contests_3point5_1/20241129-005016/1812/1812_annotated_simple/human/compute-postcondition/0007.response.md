Example Answer:
The value of `M` is modified by applying the XOR operation with 3. As `M` can be either 1 or 2, after XOR with 3, the new value of `M` will be 2 or 1 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number and s is a character representing the seat in the row; N is the extracted row number from the seat description, C can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; M can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 and M is either 2 or 1.
