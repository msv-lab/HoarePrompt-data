Example Answer:
The value of N is incremented by M. Since N is a positive integer representing the row number and M is either 2 or 1, the new value of N will be the original row number plus 2 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is the new row number, s is the seat character; C can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; M is either 2 or 1.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is the new row number, s is the seat character; C can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; M is either 2 or 1**
