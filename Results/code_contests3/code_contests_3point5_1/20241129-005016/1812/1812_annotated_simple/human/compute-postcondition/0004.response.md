Example Answer: 
M is assigned the value of N - 1 & 3. Since N can be any positive integer between 1 and 10^18, and the bitwise AND operation with 3 will result in a value between 0 and 3, M can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number and s is a character representing the seat in the row; N is the extracted row number from the seat description, C can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; M can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
Output State: **Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number and s is a character representing the seat in the row; N is the extracted row number from the seat description, C can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; M can be 0, 1, 2, or 3**
