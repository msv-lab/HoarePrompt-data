The value of `N` is assigned by converting the string `S` excluding its last character to an integer. Since `S` represents Vasya's seat, the row number is extracted by removing the last character which is the seat character. Therefore, the row number `n` is extracted from Vasya's seat description. 

Output State: **Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'); N is the extracted row number from the seat description.**
