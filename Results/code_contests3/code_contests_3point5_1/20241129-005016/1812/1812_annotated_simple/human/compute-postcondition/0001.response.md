Example Answer: 
The value of `S` is assigned the input from the user. The value of Vasya's seat is unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f').
Output State: **Vasya's seat is described as ns, where n is a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and s is a character representing the seat in the row ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f')**
