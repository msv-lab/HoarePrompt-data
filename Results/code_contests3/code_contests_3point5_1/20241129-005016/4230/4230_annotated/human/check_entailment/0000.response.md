Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem description. It reads the input values, iterates through the sequence of opened doors, and identifies the index where the state changes from one door to the next. This index is then printed as the output.

The program ensures that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors, where k is the smallest index where the change in door location allows for an exit. It correctly handles the scenario where Mr. Black opens doors in a sequence until all doors are open and identifies the correct index for exit.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and can be considered correct.
