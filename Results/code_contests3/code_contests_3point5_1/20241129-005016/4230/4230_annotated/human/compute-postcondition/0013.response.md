According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 2, `i` is 1. Since the loop is moving in reverse order with a step of -1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to 0.
State: **`n` is 2, `c` is a list of integers based on the input, `ans` is 2, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute one more time**
