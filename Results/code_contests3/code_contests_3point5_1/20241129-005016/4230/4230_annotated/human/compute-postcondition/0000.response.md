Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which converts the input string into a list of integers. The sequence of opened doors is represented by this list of integers. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for the sequence of opened doors, the output state will be: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is represented by n integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 200,000, the sequence of opened doors is represented by n integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1**
