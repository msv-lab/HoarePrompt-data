Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the index of the first occurrence where the element at that index is not equal to the element at the next index in list `c`. The initial state is `n` is 2, `c` is a list of integers based on the input. The value of `ans` depends on the specific input provided for list `c`, so it cannot be precisely determined without knowing the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2, `c` is a list of integers based on the input, `ans` is the index of the first occurrence where the element at that index is not equal to the element at the next index in list `c`.
Output State: **`n` is 2, `c` is a list of integers based on the input, `ans` is the index of the first occurrence where the element at that index is not equal to the element at the next index in list `c`**
