Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which converts the input into integers. The values of `n` are either 0 or 1, and the input obtained can vary, so `c` will be a list of integers based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is either 0 or 1; `c` is a list of integers based on the input.
Output State: **`n` is either 0 or 1; `c` is a list of integers based on the input**
