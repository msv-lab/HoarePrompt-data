Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `ans` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is 2, `c` is a list of integers based on the input, `ans` is 2, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
