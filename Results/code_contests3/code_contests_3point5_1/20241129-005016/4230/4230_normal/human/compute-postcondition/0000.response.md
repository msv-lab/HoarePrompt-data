Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input received from `raw_input()`. However, `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, so this code will not run successfully. 
Output State: **Error: raw_input() is not defined in Python 3**
