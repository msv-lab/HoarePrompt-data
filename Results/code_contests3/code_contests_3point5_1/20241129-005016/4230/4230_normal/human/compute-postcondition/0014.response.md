Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is the current value. The condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` must hold true for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the value of `i` + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` must hold true.
Output State: **`ans` is the value of `i` + 1, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` must hold true**
