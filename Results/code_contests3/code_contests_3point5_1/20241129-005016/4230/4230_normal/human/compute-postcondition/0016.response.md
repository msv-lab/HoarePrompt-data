Postcondition: ***`ans` is the value of `i` + 1. For the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` must hold true. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `i` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
