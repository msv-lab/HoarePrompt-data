According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i`, `n`, and the condition `c[i] != c[i + 1]`. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is the value of `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and the condition `c[i] != c[i + 1]` holds true. For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`ans` is the value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and the condition `c[i - 1] != c[i]` must hold true**
