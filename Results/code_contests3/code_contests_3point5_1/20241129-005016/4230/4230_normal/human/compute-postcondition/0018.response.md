Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `ans` which represents the index of the first occurrence where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`. If no such occurrence is found, `ans` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is the index of the first occurrence where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If no such occurrence is found, `ans` remains 0.
Output State: **`ans` is the index of the first occurrence where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If no such occurrence is found, `ans` remains 0**
