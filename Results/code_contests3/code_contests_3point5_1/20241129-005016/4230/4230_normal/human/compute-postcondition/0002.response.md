Example Answer:
The code snippet provided contains an error as `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python. The correct function to use in this case is `input()`. Assuming `map` and `split` functions work as intended, the code is trying to convert the input values to integers and store them in a list `c`. However, due to the error in the initial state being uncertain, it is not possible to determine the exact impact on the program. Therefore, the Output State is uncertain due to the error in the initial state.
Output State: **Uncertain due to the error in the initial state**
