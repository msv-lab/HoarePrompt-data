Postcondition: ***`ans` is the value of `i + 1` where `i` is the index variable. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and the condition `c[i] != c[i + 1]` must hold true. If `c[i] != c[i + 1]`, then `ans` remains the same and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
