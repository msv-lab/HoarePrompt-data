Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the sequence of doors opened by Mr. Black and determines the smallest index k such that he can exit the house after opening the first k doors. The logic of checking if the current door is in a different exit than the next door is sound and ensures that the correct output is generated. The program handles all potential cases where Mr. Black opens the doors in a certain order to allow for an exit from the house.
