Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input, iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order, and checks if the current door is in a different exit than the next door. If the current door is in a different exit than the next door, it updates the answer to be the index of the current door. Finally, it prints the answer which is the smallest integer k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors. 

The logic of the program is correct and it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
