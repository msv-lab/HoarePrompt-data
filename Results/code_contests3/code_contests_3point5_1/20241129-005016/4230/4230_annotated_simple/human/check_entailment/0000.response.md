Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the sequence of opened doors in reverse order, and as soon as it finds a pair of consecutive doors that are located in different exits, it updates the `ans` variable with the index of that door. This index represents the smallest number of doors that need to be opened for Mr. Black to be able to exit the house. The program then prints this value, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all possible cases.
