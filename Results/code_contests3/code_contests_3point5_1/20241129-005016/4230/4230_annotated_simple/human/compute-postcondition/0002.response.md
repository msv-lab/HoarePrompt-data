Example Answer:
The code `c = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it based on spaces, converts each element into an integer, and stores them in the list `c`. The initial state of `n` being the first element of the list is not changed by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is still the first element of the list, `c` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is still the first element of the list, `c` is a list of integers**
