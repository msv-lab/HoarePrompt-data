Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1`, `i` is `n-2`, and the element at index `i` of list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i + 1`. After the execution of the if else block, the value of `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
