Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, and the element at index `i-1` of list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, and the element at index `i-1` of list `c` is not equal to the element at index `i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
