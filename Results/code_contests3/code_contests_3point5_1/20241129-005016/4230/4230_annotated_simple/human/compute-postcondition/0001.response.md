Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `n`. The value of `n` is based on the input, so the new value of `n` will be the first element of the previous `n` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a mapped integer list based on the input, `n` is now the first element of the list.
Output State: **`n` is now the first element of the list**
