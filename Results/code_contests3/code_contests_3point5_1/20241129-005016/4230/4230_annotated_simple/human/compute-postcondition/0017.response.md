Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the value of the last index of `c` + 1 where the element at that index is different from the previous element, `i` is either -1 or 0 depending on the last iteration, and the loop has checked for consecutive elements in the list `c` until finding a pair that is different from each other.**
