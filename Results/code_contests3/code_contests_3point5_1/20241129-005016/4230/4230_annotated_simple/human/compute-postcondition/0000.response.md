Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` takes an input and splits it based on whitespace, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split element to an integer. The previous values of `n` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a mapped integer list based on the input.
Output State: **`n` is a mapped integer list based on the input**
