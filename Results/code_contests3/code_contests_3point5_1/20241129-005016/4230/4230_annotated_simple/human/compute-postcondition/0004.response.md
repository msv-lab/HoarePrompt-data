According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is `n-1`, and `c` is a list of integers.
State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a list of integers, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is `n-1`**
