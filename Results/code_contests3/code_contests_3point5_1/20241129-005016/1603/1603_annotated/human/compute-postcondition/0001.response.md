Example Answer:
The code snippet prints a string consisting of '10' repeated n//2 times, followed by '1' if n is odd. Since n and m are integers, the value of n is between 1 and 1000. If n is even, the string will be '1010...' with n/2 times '10'. If n is odd, the string will be '1010...' with n//2 times '10' followed by '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3 and the string printed by the code snippet depends on the value of n.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^3, the printed string depends on the value of n**
