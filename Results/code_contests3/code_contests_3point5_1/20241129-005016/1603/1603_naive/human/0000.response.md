Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program simply prints '10' repeated n//2 times and adds a '1' if n is odd. This approach does not ensure that the sum of beauties of all segments will be maximized. The way flowers are placed in the exhibition is crucial to maximizing the total beauty, which is not taken into account in the program.

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3
1 3
2 4
2 5
```
The correct output should be "01100" to maximize the total beauty as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output "101010" which does not maximize the total beauty.
