Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `n` and `m` are within the range of 1 to 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000**
