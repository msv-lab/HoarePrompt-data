Example Answer:
The code prints '10' repeated n//2 times, and if n is odd, it appends '1' at the end. 
Assuming n is an even number, the output will be '10' repeated n//2 times. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and the string output is '10' repeated n//2 times.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and the string output is '10' repeated n//2 times**
