Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The description states that Sonya wants to maximize the sum of beauties of all segments by putting roses and lilies in the exhibition. However, the given code simply prints '10' repeated (n // 2) times and adds '1' if n is odd, without considering the segments and their beauty calculations. This means that the code does not actually implement the logic required to maximize the beauty sum as described in the problem.

As per the description, the program should determine the optimal arrangement of roses and lilies in each segment to maximize the beauty sum, which the given code fails to do. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **False**.
