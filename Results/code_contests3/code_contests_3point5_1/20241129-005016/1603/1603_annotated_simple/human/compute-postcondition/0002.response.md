The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for processing and validating segments [l_i, r_i] where each segment is valid with 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The parameters n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^3. The function does not return any specific value but is expected to handle the processing and validation of the segments effectively.
