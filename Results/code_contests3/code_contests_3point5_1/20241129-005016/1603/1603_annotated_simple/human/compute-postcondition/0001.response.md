Example Answer:
The code prints '10' repeated n//2 times and appends '1' if n is an odd number. Since n is between 1 and 1000, the output will be a string consisting of '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd.
Output State: **Output is a string consisting of '10' repeated n//2 times followed by '1' if n is odd**
