Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous value of `pb` is 0, and `i` can be either '0' or '1'. Therefore, if `i` is '1', then `pb` will become 1, otherwise it will remain 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1**
