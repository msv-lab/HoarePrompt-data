Example Answer:
`pb` is assigned the value 0. The value of `pb` is now 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 0**
