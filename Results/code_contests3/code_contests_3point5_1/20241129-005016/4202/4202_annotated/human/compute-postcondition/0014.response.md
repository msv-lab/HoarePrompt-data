Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the value of `i` is '1'. The previous state of `pb` is unknown, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'**
