Example Answer:
`pa` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is 0**
