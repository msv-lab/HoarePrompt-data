According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the input string should still have characters remaining after the last iteration. Therefore, the next character in the input string will be processed in the next iteration.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1**
