Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The previous values of `pa` and `i` are unknown, but `i` is either '0' or '1' since it is a string of 0s and 1s. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'**
