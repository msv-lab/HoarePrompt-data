Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The value of `i` can be either '0' or '1'. If `i` is '1', then `pa` will increase by 1. The length of `a` and `b` is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings of 0s and 1s with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'**
