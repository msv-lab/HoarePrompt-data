Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the number of '1's in the input strings `a` and `b`, then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This matches the requirements of the problem description, as it checks if it is possible to turn string `a` into string `b` based on the count of '1's in each string. The program does not perform any other operations outside of what is specified in the problem description.
