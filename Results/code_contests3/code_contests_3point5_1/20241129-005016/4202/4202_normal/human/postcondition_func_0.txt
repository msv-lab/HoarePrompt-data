The function `func` takes no parameters and operates by processing two strings `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function then counts the number of '1's in each string, compares the counts, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
