Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two input strings `a` and `b` and calculates the number of '1's in each string. Then it compares the counts and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the count of '1's in `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it accurately determines if it is possible to turn string `a` into string `b` based on the number of '1's in each string. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints confirm this behavior.
