Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1'. The previous values of `pa`, `a`, and `b` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1'**
