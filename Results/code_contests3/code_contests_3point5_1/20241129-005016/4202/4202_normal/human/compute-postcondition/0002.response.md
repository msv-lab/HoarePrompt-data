Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the input `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `i` is provided by the user, so it can be any string. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1'.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1'**
