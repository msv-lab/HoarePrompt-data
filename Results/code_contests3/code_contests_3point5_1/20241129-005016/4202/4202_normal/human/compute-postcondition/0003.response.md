According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the user input. If there is more input available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are 01-strings, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more input available.
State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1', there is more input available for the next iteration**
