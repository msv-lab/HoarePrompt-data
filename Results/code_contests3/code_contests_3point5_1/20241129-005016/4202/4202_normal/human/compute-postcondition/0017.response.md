The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates solely with the constraints mentioned. The function processes two strings `a` and `b`, where both are 01-strings containing only "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The function then performs a specific operation on these strings and returns a certain output.
