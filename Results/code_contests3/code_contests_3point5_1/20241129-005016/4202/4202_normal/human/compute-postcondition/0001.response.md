According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input provided by the user. Since raw_input() reads user input until the Enter key is pressed, the loop will execute as long as the user provides some input. Before the loop starts, `a`, `b`, and `pa` do not directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` is the input provided by the user.
State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is the input provided by the user**
