Example Answer:
The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the input `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is 0 and the input `i` represents the number of '1's in the user inputs. Therefore, if the input `i` is '1', `pb` will be incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is the total count of '1's in the user inputs, `pb` is 1**
