According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the user input. Since the loop is based on the user input, the adjustment needed is that the raw input should not be empty, i.e., it should have at least 1 character. 
State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is the total count of '1's in the user inputs, `pb` is 0, the raw input is not empty**
