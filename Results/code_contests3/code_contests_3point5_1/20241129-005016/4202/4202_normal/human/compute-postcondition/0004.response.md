Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input `i` is '1'. The initial state of `pa` is unknown, so after execution, `pa` will be incremented by 1 if the user input `i` is '1'. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1', there is more input available for the next iteration.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings, `pa` is incremented by 1 if the user input is '1', there is more input available for the next iteration**
