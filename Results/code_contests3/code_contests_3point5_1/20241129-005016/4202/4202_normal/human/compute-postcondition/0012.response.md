Example Answer:
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The value of `i` is not specified, but `pb` is initially 1. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` will become 2. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is the total count of '1's in the user inputs, `pb` is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is the total count of '1's in the user inputs, `pb` is either 1 or 2**
