Example Answer: 
`pa` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is 0.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are 01-strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `pa` is 0**
