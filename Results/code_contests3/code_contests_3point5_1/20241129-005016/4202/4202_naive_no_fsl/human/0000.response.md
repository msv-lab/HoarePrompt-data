Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the parity of both strings 'a' and 'b' by counting the number of '1's in each string. It then compares the number of '1's in 'a' and 'b' and prints "YES" if the number of '1's in 'a' is greater than or equal to the number of '1's in 'b', otherwise it prints "NO". This logic aligns with the problem description provided. 

The program handles all potential cases where the transformation of 'a' to 'b' is possible or not based on the defined operations. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
