Example Answer: 
`pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '1'. The value of `i` is not given, but if `i` is '1', then `pb` increases by 1. The total number of '1' characters in the input string is stored in `pa`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1' and there are still characters left in the input string.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1' and there are still characters left in the input string**
