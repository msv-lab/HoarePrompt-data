According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string. If there are still characters left in the input string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are strings, `pa` is the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be characters left in the input string.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1' and there are still characters left in the input string**
