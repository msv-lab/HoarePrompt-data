According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string. If there are more characters left in the input string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1', `i` is the first character of the input string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters in the input string.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is the total number of '1' characters in the input string, `pb` is increased by 1 if `i` is '1', `i` is the second character of the input string**
