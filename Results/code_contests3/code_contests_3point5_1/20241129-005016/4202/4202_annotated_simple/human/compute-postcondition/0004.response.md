Example Answer:
`pa` is incremented by 1 if the next character in the input string is '1'. The current value of `pa` is unknown, but it will increase by 1 if `i` is '1'. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character in the input string is '1', `i` is the next character in the input string.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character in the input string is '1', `i` is the next character in the input string**
