Functionality: **The function `func` reads input strings and counts the occurrences of '1' characters in each string. It then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not have any parameters and does not return anything.**
