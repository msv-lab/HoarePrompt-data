According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input. So the loop will execute if the input is not empty. Before the loop starts, `pa` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the input being a non-empty string, and for the first iteration, `i` is the first character in the input string.
State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting of only "0" and "1" characters, with lengths between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character in the input string**
