The function `func` reads input values `n` and `t`, where `n` represents the number of time values Luba has to spend on work each day, and `t` represents the total number of days. It then reads a list of time values for each day and calculates the total time Luba has spent on work for `t` days by subtracting each day's time from 86400. The function prints the total number of days `i` that have been processed.
