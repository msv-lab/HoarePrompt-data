Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of days Luba can finish reading the book. The program only subtracts the time spent on work from 86400 for each day, but it does not keep track of the cumulative time spent. Additionally, it does not consider the scenario where Luba may have free time to read after finishing work on a particular day. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
