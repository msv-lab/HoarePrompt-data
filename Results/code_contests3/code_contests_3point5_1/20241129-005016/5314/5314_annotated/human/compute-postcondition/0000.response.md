Example Answer:
n and t are assigned the values extracted by splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers using the map function. The values of n and t are constrained as mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **n and t are integers satisfying the given constraints**
