Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]), where `i` is initially 2. The previous values of `t` and `a[i]` are known, so after execution, `t` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `t` is updated based on the calculation mentioned**
