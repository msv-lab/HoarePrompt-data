Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the value 0. The states of `n`, `t`, and `a` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 0**
