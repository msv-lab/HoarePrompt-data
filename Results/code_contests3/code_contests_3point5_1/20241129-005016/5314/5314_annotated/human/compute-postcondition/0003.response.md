According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer satisfying the given constraints. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
