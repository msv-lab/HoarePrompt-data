Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of the list returned by `raw_input().split()`. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings**
