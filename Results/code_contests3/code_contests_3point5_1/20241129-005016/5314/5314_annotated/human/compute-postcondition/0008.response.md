Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i]).
Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 - int(a[i])**
