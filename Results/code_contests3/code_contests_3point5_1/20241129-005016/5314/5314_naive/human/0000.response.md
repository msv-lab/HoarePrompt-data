Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where Luba finishes reading the book in the middle of a day. For example, if the input is:
```
2 5
86400 86395
```
The correct output should be 1, as Luba finishes reading on the first day. However, the program will output 2 as it only considers the time spent on each day and does not account for the possibility of finishing reading within a day.
