Example Answer:
The value of `t` is decremented by the result of the expression `86400 - int(a[i])`. The loop continues as long as `t` remains greater than 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
