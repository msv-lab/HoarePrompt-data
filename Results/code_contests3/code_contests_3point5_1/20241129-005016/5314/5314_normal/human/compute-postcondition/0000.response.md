Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values returned by `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input and splits it, `int` converts the split values to integers, and `list` creates a list of those integers. Since we don't have information about the input values, the output state is: `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input**
