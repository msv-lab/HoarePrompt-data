Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of strings obtained by splitting the input based on whitespace. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings**
