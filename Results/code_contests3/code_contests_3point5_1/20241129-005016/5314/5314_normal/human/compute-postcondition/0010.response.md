Example Answer:
`t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i]), where `a[i]` is an element from the list of strings `a` converted to an integer. The loop will execute again only if `t` is greater than 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is increased by 1, `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i]).
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is increased by 1, `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i])**
