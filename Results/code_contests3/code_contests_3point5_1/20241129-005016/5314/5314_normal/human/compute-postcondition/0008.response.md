Example Answer:
`i` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute again if `t` is greater than 1. `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i]).
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute again `t` is greater than 1, `t` is decreased by 86400 - int(a[i])**.
