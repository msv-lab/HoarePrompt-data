`i` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are assigned integer values based on user input, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 0**
