Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values for `n` and `t`, then reads a list of integers `a` representing the time Luba has to spend working each day.
- It iterates through the elements of `a` subtracting each element from `86400` from `t` until `t` becomes less than 0.
- Finally, it prints the value of `i`, which represents how many elements of `a` were subtracted from `t`.
- The code correctly follows the problem description by determining the minimum number of days Luba can finish reading the book based on the given time constraints.
- Since the code iterates through each day's work time and subtracts it from the total time required to read the book `t`, it accurately determines the minimum day when Luba finishes reading.
- Additionally, the loop will ensure that all days are considered, and the output will be the correct day number for Luba to finish reading the book.
