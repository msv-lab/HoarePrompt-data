The function `func` reads inputs for `n` and `t`, then reads a list of integers `a`. It iterates through the elements of `a` subtracting each element from `86400` from `t` until `t` becomes less than 0. Finally, it prints the value of `i`, which represents how many elements of `a` were subtracted from `t`. The function does not have a specified return value. However, a potential edge case to consider is what happens if the loop finishes and `t` is still greater than 0.
