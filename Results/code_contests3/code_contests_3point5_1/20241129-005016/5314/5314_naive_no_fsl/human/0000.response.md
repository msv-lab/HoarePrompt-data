Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It simply subtracts the time Luba spends on work each day from 86400 (total seconds in a day) until the reading time becomes zero. This is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

A counterexample is when the input is:
```
2 2
86400 86398
```
The expected output is 2, but the program will output 1 because it does not consider the remaining time from the previous day.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
