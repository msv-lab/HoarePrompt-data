Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The main issue is that the program does not consider the case where Luba finishes reading the book before the given number of days. It only focuses on subtracting the time spent working each day from the total time needed to read the book.

The correct approach should involve keeping track of the total time spent reading and comparing it with the time needed to finish the book. Additionally, the program should also consider the case where Luba finishes reading before the given number of days.
