**Precondition:**
- n is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- t is a positive integer representing the time required to read the book (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6).
- ai is a non-negative integer representing the time Luba has to spend working during the i-th day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400).
- The answer for the minimum day when Luba finishes reading doesn't exceed n.
