Example Answer:
The `raw_input().split()` function takes an input and splits it based on spaces, creating a list of strings. The variable `a` is assigned this list of strings. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input**
