According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` is greater than 0**
