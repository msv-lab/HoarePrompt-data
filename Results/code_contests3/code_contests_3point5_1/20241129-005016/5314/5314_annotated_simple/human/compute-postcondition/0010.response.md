Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated by subtracting 86400 minus the integer value of `a[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since the loop needs to execute one more time, `t` should be greater than 0. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is updated based on the calculation `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `t` is greater than 0**
