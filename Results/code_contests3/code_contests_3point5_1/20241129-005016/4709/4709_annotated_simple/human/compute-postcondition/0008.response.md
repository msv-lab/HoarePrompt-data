According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the integer values of `A` and `B`. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, the loop will not execute as the range will be empty. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the integer value of `A` should be different from the integer value of `B`. Additionally, `ans` should be set to 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.

State: **`l` contains the elements of the 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `A` is the top-left element, `B` is the element to the right of `A`, `ans` is initialized to 0, `int(A)` is not equal to `int(B)`. If the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1.**
