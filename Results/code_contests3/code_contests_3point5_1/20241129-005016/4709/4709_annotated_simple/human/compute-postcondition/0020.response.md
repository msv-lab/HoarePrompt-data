Postcondition: ***`l` contains the elements of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. New values for `A` and `B` are based on the grid elements. `ans` is increased by 2. `C` is a list of strings converted from integers `i` where `C[0]` is not equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is not equal to `C[3]`. For the loop to execute one more time `A` must be less than `B`. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
