Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of the element at index 1 in list `l`, where `l` contains the elements of the 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. Since `A` is the top-left element of the grid, the element at index 1 is the element to the right of `A`. Therefore, `B` is the element to the right of `A` in the grid.
Output State: **`l` contains the elements of the 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `A` is the top-left element, `B` is the element to the right of `A`**
