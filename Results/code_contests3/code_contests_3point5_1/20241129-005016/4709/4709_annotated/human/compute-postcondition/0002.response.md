Example Answer:
The variable `A` is assigned the value of the first list in `l`, which contains the letters of the first row of the grid. Since the initial state of `l` is a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of the corresponding row of the grid, after execution, `A` will contain the letters of the first row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of the corresponding row of the grid, `A` contains the letters of the first row of the grid**
