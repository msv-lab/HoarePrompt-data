Example Answer:
The variable `l` is assigned the result of `a.split()`, where `a` is a 3x3 square grid of lowercase English letters. The `split()` function splits the string `a` into a list of strings based on whitespace. Therefore, `l` will be a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of the corresponding row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of the corresponding row of the grid**
