Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of the second list in `l`, so `B` now contains the letters of the second row of the grid. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of the corresponding row of the grid, `A` contains the letters of the first row of the grid, `B` contains the letters of the second row of the grid.
Output State: **`l` is a list of 3 lists, each containing the letters of the corresponding row of the grid, `A` contains the letters of the first row of the grid, `B` contains the letters of the second row of the grid**
