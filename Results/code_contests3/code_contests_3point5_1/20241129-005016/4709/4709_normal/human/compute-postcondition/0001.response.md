Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the result of splitting the string `a` into a list based on whitespace. Since the initial state consists of 3 rows of lowercase English letters, `a` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: Input consists of 3 rows of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`.
Output State: **Input consists of 3 rows of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`**
