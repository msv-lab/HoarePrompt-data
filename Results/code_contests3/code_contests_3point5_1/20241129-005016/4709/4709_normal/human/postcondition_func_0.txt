The function `func` reads input consisting of 3 rows of lowercase English letters, extracts values A and B, and compares them. If A equals B, it sets the variable `ans` to 1. Then, it iterates over the range from A to B, converts each number in the range to a list of digits, and increments `ans` by 1 for numbers where the first and fifth digits are equal and the second and fourth digits are equal. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
