Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of `n` and `k` are integers and satisfy the condition 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18**
