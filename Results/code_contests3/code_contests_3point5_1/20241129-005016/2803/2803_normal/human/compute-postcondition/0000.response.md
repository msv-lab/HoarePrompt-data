Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values extracted from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Given that n and k are positive integers and 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18, the values assigned to n and k will fall within this range after extraction. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18**
