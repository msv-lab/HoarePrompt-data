Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly follow the problem description. The code seems to only consider the value of `k` and not handle the actual logic of finding the largest possible xor-sum of candies that Grisha can obtain. The output hints do not align with the code, as the code does not calculate the largest xor-sum possible based on the given conditions. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
