The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, and based on the value of `k`, it either calculates and prints the number of ways to choose `k` items from `n` items without replacement using a mathematical formula or prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the parameters `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^18.
