Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, calculates a specific value based on these inputs, and then prints the result. The calculation involves determining the length of the binary representation of `n`, raising 2 to that length and subtracting 1 from the result if `k` is greater than 1, otherwise it returns `n`. The function does not have any explicit return value as it directly prints the result. However, the function is expected to handle cases where `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
