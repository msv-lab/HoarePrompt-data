The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for performing a specific calculation based on predefined constraints. The function returns a specific output based on the values of `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function does not have any input parameters, and the return value is determined solely by the calculation performed within the function.
