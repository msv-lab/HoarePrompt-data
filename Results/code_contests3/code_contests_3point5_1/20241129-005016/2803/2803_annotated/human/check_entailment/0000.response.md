Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, calculates the maximum xor-sum according to the given formula, and prints the result. The calculation involves determining the length of the binary representation of `n`, raising 2 to that length and subtracting 1 from the result if `k` is greater than 1, otherwise it returns `n`. This logic aligns with the problem description and will give the correct output for all valid inputs.
