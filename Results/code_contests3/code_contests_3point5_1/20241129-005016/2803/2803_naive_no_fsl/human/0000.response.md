Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the largest possible xor-sum that Grisha can obtain given the constraints of taking no more than k candies from the bag. The logic used in the program is based on bitwise XOR operations and finding the maximum xor-sum based on the number of candies and the limit k. The program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for each case described in the problem statement.
