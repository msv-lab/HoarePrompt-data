    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing all '9's with '1's for each row in the dataset. `input` is assigned the function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the function `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `T` is the total number of rows in the dataset, `row` is empty, `nRow` is not empty, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is 8
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a dataset consisting of rows with characters from '1' to '9', replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and outputs the updated dataset. It does not take any parameters and does not return any value.
