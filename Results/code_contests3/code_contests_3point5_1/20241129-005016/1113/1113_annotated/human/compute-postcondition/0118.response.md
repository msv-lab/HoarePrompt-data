According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains either '11' or '110', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, and `i` is 10. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be not equal to '9'.
State: **`nRow` contains either '11' or '110', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, and `i` is not equal to '9' for the loop to execute one more time**
