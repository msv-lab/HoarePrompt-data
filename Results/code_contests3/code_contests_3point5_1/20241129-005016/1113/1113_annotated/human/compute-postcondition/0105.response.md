According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated to the next number in the range, which is 9 in this case.
State: **`nRow` is a string containing '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9**
