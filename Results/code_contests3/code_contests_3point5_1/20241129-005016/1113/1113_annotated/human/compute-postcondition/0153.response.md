Postcondition: ***`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty after the loop executes, `row` is not empty and contains the user input after stripping. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.***
