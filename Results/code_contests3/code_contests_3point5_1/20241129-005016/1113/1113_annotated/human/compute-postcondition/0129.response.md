According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, `i` needs to be between 0 and 8 for the loop to execute. 
State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty**
