According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` are all 10. `nRow` is a string with an additional '1' if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is 20 and `i` and `row` remain unchanged. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions:
1. If `i` is less than '9', `nRow` should remain as 20 and `i` should be incremented by 1.
2. If `i` is '9', `nRow` should be updated to have an additional '1' and `i` should be reset to 0. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` are all 10. `nRow` is a string with an additional '1'. `i` is 0, `row` remains unchanged**
