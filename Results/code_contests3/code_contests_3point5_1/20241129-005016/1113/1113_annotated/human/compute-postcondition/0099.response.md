According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is either '11' or '19', `row` is not empty, and if `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '11' if the condition is met, otherwise `nRow` is set to '19'. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`nRow` is '11' or '19', `row` is not empty, if `i` is '10', `nRow` is set to '11' if the condition is met, otherwise `nRow` is set to '19'**
