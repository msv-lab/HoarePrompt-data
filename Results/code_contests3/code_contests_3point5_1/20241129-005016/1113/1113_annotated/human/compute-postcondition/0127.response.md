Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The values of `res`, `nRow`, `t`, and `i` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is between 0 and 8.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is between 0 and 8**
