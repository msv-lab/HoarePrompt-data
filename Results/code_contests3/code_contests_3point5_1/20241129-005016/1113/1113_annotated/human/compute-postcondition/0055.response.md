According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10 and `row` is a string. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `row`.
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `nRow`, `i` is 10, `row` is a string, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than the length of `row`**
