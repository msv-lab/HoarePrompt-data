Postcondition: ***`nRow` contains either '111' or '1101', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, and `i` is not equal to '9' for the loop to execute one more time if `i` is '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` contains either '11' or '110', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow + i`, and `i` is not equal to '9' for the loop to execute one more time.***
