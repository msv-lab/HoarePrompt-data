Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, where `i` is between 0 and 8. The value of `nRow` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`**
