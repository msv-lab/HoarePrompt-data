Postcondition: ***`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow`, `i` are initialized as specified. If `i` is equal to '9', then `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow` are updated with the concatenated string and `i` remains the same. Otherwise, `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row` are initialized as specified, and `nRow` is updated based on the last iteration.***
