Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. Since no changes were made to `nRow`, the value of `res` will now contain two instances of `nRow`. The value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', `row` is not empty, `res` contains two instances of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` contains a string where every occurrence of '9' in `row` has been replaced by '1', `row` is not empty, `res` contains two instances of `nRow`, `i` is not equal to '9'**
