According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is '9', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is '1', `row` is not empty, and `i` is '9'. Since `i` is '9' at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time `nRow` must be '1'.
State: **`nRow` is '1', `row` is not empty, if `i` is '9'**
