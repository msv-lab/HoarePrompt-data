`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`input` is assigned the function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the function `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9 for the loop to execute, `row` is assigned the stripped input value, `nRow` is an empty string**.
