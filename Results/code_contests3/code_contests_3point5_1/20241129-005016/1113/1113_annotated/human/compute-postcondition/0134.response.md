Postcondition: ***`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty. If `i` equals '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.***
