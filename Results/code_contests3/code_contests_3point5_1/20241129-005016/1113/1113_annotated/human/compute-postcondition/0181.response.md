Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing all '9's with '1's for each row and the new row is appended, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty after the loop executes, `row` contains the user input after stripping. The loop iterates through each character in `row`, if the character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`, otherwise the character itself is appended. The loop continues until all characters in `row` have been processed.**
