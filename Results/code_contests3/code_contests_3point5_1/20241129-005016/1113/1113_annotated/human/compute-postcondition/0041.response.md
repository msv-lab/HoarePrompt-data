Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so if `nRow` was initially 'abc', it will become 'abc1'. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow` is updated with the concatenated string, `i` remains the same.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow` is updated with the concatenated string, `i` remains the same**
