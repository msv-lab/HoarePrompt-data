Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with '1'. As `nRow` was '11' or '19' initially, after concatenation it becomes '111' or '191'. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '111' or '191', `row` is not empty, if `i` is '10', `nRow` is set to '11' if the condition is met, otherwise `nRow` is set to '19'.
Output State: **`nRow` is '111' or '191', `row` is not empty, if `i` is '10', `nRow` is set to '11' if the condition is met, otherwise `nRow` is set to '19'**
