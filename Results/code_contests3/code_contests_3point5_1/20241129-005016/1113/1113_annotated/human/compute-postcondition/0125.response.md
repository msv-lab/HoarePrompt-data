According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row. So for the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **After the loop executes, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, for the loop to execute one more time `t` is increased by 1**
