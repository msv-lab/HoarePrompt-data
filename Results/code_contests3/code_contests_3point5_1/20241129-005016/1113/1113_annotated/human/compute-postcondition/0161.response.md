Postcondition: ***`res` contains the updated values of `nRow`, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `nRow` is not empty after the loop executes, `row` is not empty and contains the user input after stripping, `i` is between 0 and 8. If `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
