Example Answer: 
`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes the string '11'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` are all 10, `nRow` is the string '11', `i` is 0, `row` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T` are all 10, `nRow` is the string '11', `i` is 0, `row` remains unchanged**
