According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be less than 9.
State: **After appending `nRow` to `res`, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than 9**
