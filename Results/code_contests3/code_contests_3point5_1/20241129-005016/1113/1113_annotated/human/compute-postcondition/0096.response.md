Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is concatenated with '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '11', `row` is not empty, if `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is '11', `row` is not empty, if `i` is '9'**
