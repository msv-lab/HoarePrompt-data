According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty for the loop to execute.
State: **`nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
