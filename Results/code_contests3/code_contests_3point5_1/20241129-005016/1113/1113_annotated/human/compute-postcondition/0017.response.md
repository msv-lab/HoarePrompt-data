According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is assigned the stripped input value with `row` not empty, `i` is the first character in `row`. If `i` was not '9', then `nRow` was the concatenation of characters in `row`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` should still have more characters, and the loop should continue with the next character in `row`.
State: **`input` is assigned the function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the function `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `row` is assigned the stripped input value with `row` not empty, `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the concatenation of characters in `row`, for the loop to execute the next time `i` is the next character in `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
