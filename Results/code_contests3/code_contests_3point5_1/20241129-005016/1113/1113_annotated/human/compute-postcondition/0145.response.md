According to the code, the loop executes 9 times for each value of `i` from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8. If `i` equals '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty. If `i` equals '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`.**
