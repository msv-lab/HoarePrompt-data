Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its existing value. The value of `nRow` is not specified in the initial state, so it is assumed to be an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be '1' added to its previous value. 
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow` is an updated string with '1', `t` are all assigned specific functions or values.**
