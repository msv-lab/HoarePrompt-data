Postcondition: ***`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row and the new row is appended, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty after the loop executes, `row` contains the user input after stripping. For each iteration, if `i` is equal to '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `i` is appended to `nRow`. The loop executes until `i` reaches the next value within the range of 0 to 8.***
