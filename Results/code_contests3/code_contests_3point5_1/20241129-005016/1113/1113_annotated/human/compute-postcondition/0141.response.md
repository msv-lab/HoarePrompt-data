Example Answer: 
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`, which is between 0 and 8. The updated values of `nRow` now contain the original rows with the value of `i` added at the end. The variable `t` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8 (updated if necessary), `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8 (updated if necessary), `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty**
