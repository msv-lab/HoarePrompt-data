Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned the function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the function `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 9, `row` is assigned the stripped input value with `row` not empty, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the concatenation of characters in `row` followed by '1' if `i` is not '9', and `i` is not equal to '9'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the concatenation of characters in `row` and `i` as long as `i` is not '9', and `i` is the next character in `nRow`. After the if else block executes, `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' at the end if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is the concatenation of characters in `row` followed by the next character in `row` if it is not '9', and `i` becomes the next character in `nRow`.***
