Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, and the previous value of `nRow` and `i` are known. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `nRow` will be the sum of the previous value of `nRow` and `i`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row` are initialized as specified, `nRow` is updated based on the last iteration**
