Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, where `i` is '10'. If the condition is met, `nRow` is set to '1110', otherwise, `nRow` is set to '1910'. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '1110' or '1910', `row` is not empty, `i` is '10'.
Output State: **`nRow` is either '1110' or '1910', `row` is not empty, `i` is '10'**
