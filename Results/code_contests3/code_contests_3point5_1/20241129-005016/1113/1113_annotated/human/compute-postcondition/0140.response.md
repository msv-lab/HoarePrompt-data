Example Answer:
The code appends '1' to the end of the `nRow` string. This means each row in `nRow` has '1' added to it. The value of `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, so it will reflect the changes accordingly. The value of `t` is increased by 1, and the value of `i` remains between 0 and 8. The row is not empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty**
