Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `nRow` will be the current value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, the value of `i` is not equal to '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is the value of `i`, `row` is not empty, the value of `i` is not equal to '9'**
