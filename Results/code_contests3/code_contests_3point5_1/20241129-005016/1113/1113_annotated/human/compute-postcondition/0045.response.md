Example Answer:
The list `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow`, `i` are initialized as specified, and `nRow` now contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'.
Output State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow`, `i` are initialized as specified, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'**
