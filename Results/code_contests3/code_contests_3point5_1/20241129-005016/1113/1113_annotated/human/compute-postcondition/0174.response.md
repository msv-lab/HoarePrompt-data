Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row and the new row is appended, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty after the loop executes, `row` contains the user input after stripping, `i` is the next value within the range of 0 to 8. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the next value within the range of 0 to 8.**
