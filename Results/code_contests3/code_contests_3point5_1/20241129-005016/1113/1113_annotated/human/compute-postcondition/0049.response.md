According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `row` string. Since `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, it is essential that `row` is not an empty string for the loop to execute. In addition, the loop will execute a tenth time, so `i` should be adjusted such that it is equal to 10. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `nRow`, `i` are initialized as specified, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 10, `row` is not an empty string**
