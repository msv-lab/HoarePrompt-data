According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is a string, `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `i` should be incremented by 1. If `i` was equal to '9' in the previous iteration, then `nRow` should now contain '1'. If `i` was not equal to '9', then `nRow` should now contain '9'.

State: **`nRow` contains '1' (if `i` was equal to '9' in the previous iteration, otherwise '9'), `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 10 for the loop to execute one more time**
