Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the stripped input value. The variable `nRow` containing '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9' is not affected. The variable `res` is also unaffected. The value of `i` is 9 and remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string containing '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9', `row` is the stripped input value, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9.
Output State: **`nRow` is a string containing '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9', `row` is the stripped input value, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9**
