Postcondition: ***`input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow`, `i` are initialized as specified. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will contain the string '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will contain the value of `i` and be concatenated with '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` should still have elements to iterate over and `i` should be updated based on the last iteration.***
