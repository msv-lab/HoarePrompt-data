Example Answer:
The input is stripped and stored in the variable `row`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than 9. No other variables are affected in this code snippet.
Output State: **After appending `nRow` to `res`, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than 9, `row` contains the stripped input.**
