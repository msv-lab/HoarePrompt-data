Example Answer: 
`nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The values of `res`, `t`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is an empty string.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is an empty string**
