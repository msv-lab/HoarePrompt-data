Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is a string containing '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`.
Output State: **`nRow` is a string containing '1's and the values of `i` that were not '9', `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`**
