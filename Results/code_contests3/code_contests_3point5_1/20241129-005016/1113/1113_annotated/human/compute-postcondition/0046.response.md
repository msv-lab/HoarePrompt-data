According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times as the range is specified as 9. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `input`, `write`, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `row`, `nRow`, `i` are initialized as specified, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1.
