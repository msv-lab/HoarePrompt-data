Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing all '9's with '1's for each row in the dataset. `input` is assigned the function `io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`, `write` is assigned the function `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `T` is the total number of rows in the dataset, `row` is empty, `nRow` is not empty, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is 8**
