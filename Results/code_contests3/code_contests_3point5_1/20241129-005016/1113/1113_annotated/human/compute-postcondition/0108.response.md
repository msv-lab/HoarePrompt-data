According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, and `i` is 9. 
State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `row` is not empty, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is 9 for the loop to execute**
