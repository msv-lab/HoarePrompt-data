Postcondition: ***`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row and the new row is appended, `t` is increased by the total number of rows in the dataset, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty after the loop executes, `row` contains the user input after stripping, for the loop to execute one more time the next value of `i` must be within the range of 0 to 8. If `i` is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
