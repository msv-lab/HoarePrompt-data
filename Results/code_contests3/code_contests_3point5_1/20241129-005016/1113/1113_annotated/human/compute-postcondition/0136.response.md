Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to the end of the string. The previous values of the variables are `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty, `nRow` is updated by adding '1'.
Output State: **`res` contains the updated values of `nRow` after replacing '9's with '1's for each row, `t` is increased by 1, `i` is between 0 and 8, `nRow` is not empty, row is not empty, `nRow` is updated by adding '1'**
