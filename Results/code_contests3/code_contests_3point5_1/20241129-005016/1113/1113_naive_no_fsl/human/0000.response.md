Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the sudoku puzzle, which does not guarantee that the resulting puzzle will be an anti-sudoku. The program does not handle the requirements of having each row, column, and 3x3 block containing at least two equal elements. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not provide a valid solution for the problem described.
