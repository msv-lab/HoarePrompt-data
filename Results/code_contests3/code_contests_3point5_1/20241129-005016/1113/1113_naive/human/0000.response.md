Correctness: **False**

The given program simply replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row of the sudoku puzzle. This does not guarantee that the resulting sudoku will be an anti-sudoku.

To create an anti-sudoku, there needs to be at least two equal elements in each row, column, and 3x3 block. The current program does not ensure this condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for creating an anti-sudoku.
