Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' to the end of the string stored in `nRow`. Since the initial state mentions that `nRow` already contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and appending nRow, after this operation, `nRow` will have an additional '1' added to the end. Therefore, the Output State is: maxint contains the value float('inf'), write is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, res contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and nRow, T is greater than 0, t is 1, row contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, nRow contains the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's and an additional '1' added at the end, i is the next character in the input row, nRow is updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **maxint contains the value float('inf'), write is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, res contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and nRow, T is greater than 0, t is 1, row contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, nRow contains the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's and an additional '1' added at the end, i is the next character in the input row, nRow is updated based on the conditions**
