Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, all variables retain their initial values with the exceptions that `nRow` will contain the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended at the end, otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`.***
