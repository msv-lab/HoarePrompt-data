Example Answer:
`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `maxint`, `write`, and `res` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'); `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout; `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'); `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout; `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer**
