Output State: **After the execution, all variables retain their initial values except for `nRow` which will contain the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended at the end, otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be more characters left in `row`.**
