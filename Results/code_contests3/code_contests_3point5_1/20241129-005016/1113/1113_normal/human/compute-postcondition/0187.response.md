Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a 9x9 grid representing the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle, replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and outputs the modified grid. The function does not explicitly return a value but prints the modified grid. Therefore, the functionality is to transform the input sudoku solution by replacing '9's with '1's in each row and display the modified grid.**
