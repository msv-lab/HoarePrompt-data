Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces and starts with '9', `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`, `res` now contains `nRow`, `nRow` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `row` starts with '9', `i` is the first character in `row`, and the value of `i` is '9`***
