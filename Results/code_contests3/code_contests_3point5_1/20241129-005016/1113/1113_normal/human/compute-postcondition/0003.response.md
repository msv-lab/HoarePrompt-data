Example Answer:
The `write` variable is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Standard output has been redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object using the `atexit.register()` function; `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`.
