Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '11' and `res` appends `nRow`. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is the concatenation of its previous value and the next element in `row`.***
