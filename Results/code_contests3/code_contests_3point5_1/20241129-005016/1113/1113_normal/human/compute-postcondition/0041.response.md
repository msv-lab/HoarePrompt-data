Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding '1' at the end. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so after execution, `nRow` will have an additional '1' at the end. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character to be processed in row, `row` is updated to remove the character that was just processed, `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i` with an additional '1' at the end.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character to be processed in row, `row` is updated to remove the character that was just processed, `nRow` is updated with an additional '1' at the end**
