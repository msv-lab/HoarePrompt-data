According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' is appended at the end of `nRow`, otherwise, `i` is appended. So for the loop to execute one more time, there should be more characters left in `row`.
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, all variables retain their initial values with the exceptions that `nRow` will contain the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will have '1' appended at the end, otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be more characters left in `row`.**
