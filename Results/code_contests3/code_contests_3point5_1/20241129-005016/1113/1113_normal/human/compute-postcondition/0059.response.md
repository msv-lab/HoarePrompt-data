According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters left in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`, and if `i` is equal to '9', '1' is appended at the end of `nRow`; otherwise, `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **All variables retain their initial values except for `nRow`, which will contain the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' will be appended at the end of `nRow`; otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be more characters left in `row` after the current iteration.**
