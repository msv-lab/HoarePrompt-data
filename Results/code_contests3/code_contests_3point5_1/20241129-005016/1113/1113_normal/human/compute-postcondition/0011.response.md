According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `row` variable to iterate over. Therefore, the `row` variable must not be empty for the loop to execute. Additionally, the loop starts with `i` being 0, so `i` should be set to 0. 

State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is an empty string**
