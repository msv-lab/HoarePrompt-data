Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list. The value of `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the string `row`. The initial state of `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. Therefore, after the code execution, the `res` list will contain `nRow`.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the string `row`**
