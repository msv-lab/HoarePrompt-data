Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character to be processed in `row`, `row` is updated to remove the character that was just processed, and `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i` with an additional '1' at the end. 
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the next character to be processed in `row`, `row` is updated to remove the character that was just processed, `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i` with an additional '1' at the end, and `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`.**
