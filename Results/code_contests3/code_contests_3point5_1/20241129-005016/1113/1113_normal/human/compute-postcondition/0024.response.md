Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is either '11' if `i == '9' or the string value of `i` if `i` is not equal to '9', and for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have more elements to iterate over and adjust `nRow` accordingly. In the if part, `nRow` remains unchanged. In the else part, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
