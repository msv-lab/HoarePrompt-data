Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty. `nRow` is either '11' if `i == '9` or the string value of `i` if `i` is not equal to '9'. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have more elements to iterate over. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11', otherwise, `nRow` takes the value of `i`.***
