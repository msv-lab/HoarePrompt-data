According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the input string `row`. Before the loop starts, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, so it ensures that the loop will execute. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string**
