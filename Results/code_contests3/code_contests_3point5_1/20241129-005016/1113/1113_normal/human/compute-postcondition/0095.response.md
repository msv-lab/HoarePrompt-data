According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be assigned the next element in `row`. 
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, `nRow` is '1', `res.append(nRow)` for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is equal to the next element in `row`**
