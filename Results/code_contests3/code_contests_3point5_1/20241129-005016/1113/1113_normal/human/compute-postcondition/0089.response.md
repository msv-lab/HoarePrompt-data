According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `row` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not an empty string. 
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, `nRow` is an empty string, `res.append(nRow)` for the loop to execute the first time**
