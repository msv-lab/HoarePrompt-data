Example Answer:
The standard output has been redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object using the `atexit.register()` function with a lambda function that writes the contents of `sys.stdout` to the standard output. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: The standard output has been redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object using the `atexit.register()` function.
Output State: **The standard output has been redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object using the `atexit.register()` function.**
