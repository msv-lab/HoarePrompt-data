Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the next character in the input string after the previous iteration. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` contains the string formed by appending '1' to the previous value of `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
