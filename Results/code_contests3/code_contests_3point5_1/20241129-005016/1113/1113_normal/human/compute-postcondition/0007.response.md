According to the code, the loop can execute if the input integer `T` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` is an empty list. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `T` needs to be greater than 0 and `t` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0**
