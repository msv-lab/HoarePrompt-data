Postcondition: ***maxint is assigned the value float('inf'), write is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, res contains nRow, T is greater than 0, t is 0, i is the last character processed in row, row is assigned the remaining characters in the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, nRow is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the string row. If i is '9', nRow is appended with '1'. If i is not equal to '9', nRow is appended with the value of i. `nRow` has an additional '1' at the end.***
