According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If there are still characters left in the `row`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as follows:
* maxint contains the value float('inf')
* write is assigned the write function from sys.stdout
* res contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and nRow is appended to res
* T is greater than 0
* t is 1
* row contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty
* nRow contains the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's
* i is the first character in the input row
* nRow is an empty string

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
* Check if there are more characters left in the `row` for iteration
* Update the value of `i` to the next character in `row`
* Update the value of `nRow` based on the conditions provided

State: **maxint contains the value float('inf'), write is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, res contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and nRow is appended to res, T is greater than 0, t is 1, row contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, nRow contains the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's, i is the next character in the input row, nRow is updated based on the conditions**
