Example Answer:
Initially, `nRow` is assigned the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', '1' will be appended at the end of `nRow`; otherwise, `nRow` will be appended with the value of `i`. The loop will execute one more time if there are more characters left in `row` after the current iteration.

Output State: **`nRow` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string `row` and appends '1' if `i` is '9' or appends the value of `i` otherwise. The loop will execute one more time if there are more characters left in `row` after the current iteration.**
