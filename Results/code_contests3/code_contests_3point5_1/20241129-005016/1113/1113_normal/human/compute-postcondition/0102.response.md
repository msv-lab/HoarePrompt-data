Postcondition: ***`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, next element in `row` is available to iterate over. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains the input string concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
