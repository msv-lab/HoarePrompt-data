According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than 9, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that `i` becomes 10.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string and `nRow` is appended to `res`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` contains the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and it is not empty, `nRow` contains the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 10**
