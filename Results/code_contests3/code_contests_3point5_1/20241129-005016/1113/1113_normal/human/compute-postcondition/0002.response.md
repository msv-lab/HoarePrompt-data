Example Answer:
The `input` function is reassigned to read input from an `io.BytesIO()` object created using `os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline`. The standard output redirection is not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet, so the output state remains the same.
Output State: **The standard output has been redirected to an `io.BytesIO()` object using the `atexit.register()` function.**
