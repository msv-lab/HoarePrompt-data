Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is either '1' if `i == '9'` or the string value of `i` if `i` is not equal to '9', for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have more elements to iterate over, `nRow` is updated by concatenating the value of `i`.**
