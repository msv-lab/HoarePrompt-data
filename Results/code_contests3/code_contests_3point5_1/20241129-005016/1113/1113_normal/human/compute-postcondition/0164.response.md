According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 10.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value float('inf'), `write` is assigned the write function from sys.stdout, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `row` contains the input string after stripping and is not empty, `nRow` contains the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is 10, `res` is appended with `nRow`**
