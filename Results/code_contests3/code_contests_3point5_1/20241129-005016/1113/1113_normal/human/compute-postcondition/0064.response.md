Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the `res` list. `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string `row`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`.
Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` contains the input string after stripping whitespaces, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input string initially assigned to `row`**
