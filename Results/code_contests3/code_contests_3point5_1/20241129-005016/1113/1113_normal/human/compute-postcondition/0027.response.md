According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 9.
State: **`maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the write function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and is not empty, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the string `row`**
