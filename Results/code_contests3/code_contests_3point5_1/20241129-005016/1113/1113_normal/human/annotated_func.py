#State of the program right berfore the function call: ** Each test case consists of a 9x9 grid where each cell contains a number from 1 to 9. The input grid represents the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxint` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, `write` is assigned the `write` function from `sys.stdout`, `res` contains the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each input string for all `T` iterations, `T` is greater than 0
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a 9x9 grid representing the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle, replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and outputs the modified grid. The function does not explicitly return a value but prints the modified grid. Therefore, the functionality is to transform the input sudoku solution by replacing '9's with '1's in each row and display the modified grid.
