Correctness: **False**

The code provided reads a 9x9 grid representing the correct solution of a sudoku puzzle, replaces all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row, and outputs the modified grid. However, the code only replaces '9's with '1's in each row, but does not change any other elements to make it an anti-sudoku. The anti-sudoku should have each row, column, and 3x3 block containing at least two equal elements, which the code does not address. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
