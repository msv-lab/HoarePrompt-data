According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, `row` contains the last input string with at least one character, `nRow` is an empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` contains '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is the value of `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and if the next character in `row` is '9', then `nRow` should contain '1'.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `row` contains the last input string with at least one character, `nRow` is either '1' or the value of the next character in `row`**
