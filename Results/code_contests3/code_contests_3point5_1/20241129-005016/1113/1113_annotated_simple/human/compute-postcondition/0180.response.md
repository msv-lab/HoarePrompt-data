Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i+1` and '1' if `i` is '9' or contains the concatenated value of `i+1` + '1' + `i` if `i` is not '9', `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character index of `row`, and `row` contains the input string after stripping. After the execution of the if else block, the values of the variables are updated based on the conditions met during the execution of the if else block.***
