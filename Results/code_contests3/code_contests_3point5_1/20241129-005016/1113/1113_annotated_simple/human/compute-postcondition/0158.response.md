According to the code, the loop can execute again if the `row` is not an empty string. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the updated character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` contains the updated string after adding '1' at the end. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `row` should not be an empty string. If `i` equals '9', the updated character should not be added to `nRow`. Otherwise, the updated character `i` should be concatenated with `nRow`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the updated character of `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` contains the updated string after adding '1' at the end**
