Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 9` if i is not equal to '9', otherwise `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended for each '9' encountered in the input string `row`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is either '9' or 10 based on the condition, `row` is the input string, `nRow` contains the updated value after appending either '1' or `i` depending on the condition, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, `nRow` is appended with '1'.**
