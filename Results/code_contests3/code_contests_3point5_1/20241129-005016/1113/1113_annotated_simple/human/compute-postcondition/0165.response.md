Example Answer:
The input string is stripped of any leading or trailing whitespaces and assigned to variable `row`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings and the new `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` contains the updated string after replacing all '9's with '1's**
