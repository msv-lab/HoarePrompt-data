Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`. The value of `i` is based on the elements in `row`, and `row` has at least two elements. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by replacing '9' with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is further updated by appending the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', and now `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', and now `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`**
