Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string and stored in the variable `row`. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is from 0 to 8, `row` is a string**
