Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is updated with '1', for the loop to execute `row` is not an empty string. When the if condition (i == '9') is true, then the program state is such that i is equal to '9'**
