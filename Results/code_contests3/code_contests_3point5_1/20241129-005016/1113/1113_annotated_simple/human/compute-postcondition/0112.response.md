Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i`. Given the initial state, `nRow` already has a value based on replacing '9' with '1' in `row`, and `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`. Since the value of `i` is not equal to '9', the new value of `nRow` will include the updated value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', the value of `i` is not equal to '9', and `nRow` is further updated by appending the value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', the value of `i` is not equal to '9', and `nRow` is further updated by appending the value of `i`**
