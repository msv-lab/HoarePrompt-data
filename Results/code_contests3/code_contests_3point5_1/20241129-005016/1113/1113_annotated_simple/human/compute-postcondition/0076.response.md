According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must not be an empty string.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `row` is not an empty string**
