Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the first character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If the character at index `i` in `row` is '9', `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is equal to the value of `i`.***
