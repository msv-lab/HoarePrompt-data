According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`, which should not be an empty string for the loop to continue. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is either '11' if i == '9' or `nRow` appended with the value of `i` if i is not equal to '9'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `row` variable must not be an empty string.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is either '11' if i == '9' or `nRow` appended with the value of `i` if i is not equal to '9', for the loop to execute `row` is not an empty string**.
