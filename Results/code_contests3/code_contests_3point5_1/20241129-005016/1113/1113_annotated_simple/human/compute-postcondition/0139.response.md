According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `row` contains the last input string with at least one character. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is '9', then `nRow` should be either '1' or the value of the next character in `row` concatenated with '1'.
- If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` should be either '1' or the value of the next character in `row', and `nRow` should be incremented by `i`.
- `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`.
- `row` should be updated to remove the character that was processed in the current iteration.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the updated input string after removing the character processed in the current iteration.**
