Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended with the character '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but `nRow` must have at least one character since the loop is executing. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` with '1' appended to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a string input from the user with at least one character, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters left in the `row` string after the current character being iterated**
