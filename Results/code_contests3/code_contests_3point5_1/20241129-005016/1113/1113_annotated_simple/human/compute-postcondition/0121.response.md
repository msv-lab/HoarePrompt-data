Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` has an added '1' at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
