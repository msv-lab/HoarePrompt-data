According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `row`. If there are more characters in `row` to iterate over, the loop will execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment the index `i` to the next character in `row`.
- Update `nRow` based on the character at the new index in `row`:
    - If the character at index `i` is '9', concatenate '1' to the original value of `nRow`.
    - If the character at index `i` is not '9', increment `nRow` by the value of `i`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i` for the loop to execute another time**
