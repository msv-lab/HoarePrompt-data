Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `res` has appended `nRow`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is not an empty string. If the character `i` in `row` is '9', `nRow` contains the updated string after adding '1' at the end. If the character `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`***
