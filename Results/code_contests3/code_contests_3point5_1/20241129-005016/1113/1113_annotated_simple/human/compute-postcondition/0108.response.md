According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `nRow` should be updated with the appended value of `nRow` after replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in `row`.
- `row` should have at least one element for the loop to execute.
- Since the loop is iterating over elements in `row`, `i` should be updated accordingly based on the elements in `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1'**
