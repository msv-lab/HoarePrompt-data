According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `T`, `i`, and `row`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the first character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string. If the character at index `i` in `row` is '9', `nRow` is '1', otherwise, `nRow` is equal to the value of `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` remains 0, `i` is increased to the next character index in `row`, and the character at this new index determines the value of `nRow`.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`**
