According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 9, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i` or the sum of its current value and `i` depending on whether `i` is equal to '9' or not. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9.
