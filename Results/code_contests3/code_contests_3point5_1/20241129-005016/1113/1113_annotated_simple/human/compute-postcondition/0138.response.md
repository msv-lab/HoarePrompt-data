Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `row` contains the last input string with at least one character. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is either '1' or the value of the next character in `row' concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is either '1' or the value of the next character in `row', and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
