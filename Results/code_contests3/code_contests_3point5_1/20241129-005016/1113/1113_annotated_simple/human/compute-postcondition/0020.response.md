Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
