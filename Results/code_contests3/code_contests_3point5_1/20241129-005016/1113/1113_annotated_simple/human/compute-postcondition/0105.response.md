According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1, so it becomes 10.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 10, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is the input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'**
