Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 9` if i is not equal to '9', otherwise `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a string input from the user with at least one character, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters left in the `row` string after the current character being iterated, `nRow` is appended with '1' if i is not equal to '9'. If i is equal to '9', `nRow` is increased by 9.***
