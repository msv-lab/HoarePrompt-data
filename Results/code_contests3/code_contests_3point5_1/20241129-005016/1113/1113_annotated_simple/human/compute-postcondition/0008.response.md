According to the code, the loop will always execute 9 times because the range is fixed from 0 to 8. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` which starts at 0 and goes up to 8 for each iteration.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is from 0 to 8**
