According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the loop range. The loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range [0, 9). Before the loop starts, `row` must not be empty for the loop to execute. So, the states need to be adjusted to `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` contains the updated value after appending either '1' or `i` depending on the condition.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` contains the updated value after appending either '1' or `i` depending on the condition, for the loop to execute**
