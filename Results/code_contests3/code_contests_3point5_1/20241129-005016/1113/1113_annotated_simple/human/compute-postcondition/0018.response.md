Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to it. Since the previous value of `nRow` is not provided, the new value of `nRow` will be the original value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`, and `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`, `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'**
