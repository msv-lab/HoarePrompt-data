Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated with the value of `i1` or the sum of its current value and `i`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i1` or the sum of its current value and `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i1` or the sum of its current value and `i`**
