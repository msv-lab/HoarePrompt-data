According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the loop range. In this case, the loop range is fixed at 9 iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than the loop range which is 9.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 9, `row` is an empty string, `nRow` contains the updated input string after replacing all '9's with '1's in the input string and `res` has appended `nRow`.**
