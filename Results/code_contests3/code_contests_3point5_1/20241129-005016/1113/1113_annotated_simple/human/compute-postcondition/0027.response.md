According to the code, the loop can execute 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 8, `row` is not an empty string. Since the loop is about to execute the 10th time, `i` will become 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is not an empty string**.
