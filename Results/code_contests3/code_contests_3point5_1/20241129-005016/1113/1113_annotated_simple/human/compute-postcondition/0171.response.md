Example Answer:
`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, so if `nRow` was empty, it will now contain the character at index `i` in `row`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character index of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, and the character at index `i` in `row` is not '9'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `nRow` contains the concatenated value of `i`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character index of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty, and the character at index `i` in `row` is not '9'**
