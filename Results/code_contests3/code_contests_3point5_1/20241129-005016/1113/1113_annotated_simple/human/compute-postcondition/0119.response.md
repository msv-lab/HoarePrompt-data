Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its existing value. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` with '1' added to it. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `nRow` is updated based on the new `i`, `nRow` has an added '1' at the end**
