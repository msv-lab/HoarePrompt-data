Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` contains the updated input string after removing the character processed in the current iteration. If `i` is '9', `nRow` contains the updated input string after appending '1' at the end. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated by adding the next character `i`.***
