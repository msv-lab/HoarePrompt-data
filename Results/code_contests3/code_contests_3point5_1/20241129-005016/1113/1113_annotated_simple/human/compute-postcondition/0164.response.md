According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings and the new `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the last character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` contains the updated string after replacing all '9's with '1's. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9, so `i` will be incremented by 1 making it 3.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings and the new `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` contains the updated string after replacing all '9's with '1's**
