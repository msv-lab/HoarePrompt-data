According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the input string `row`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `row` is not empty. Before the loop starts, `nRow` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `row` is not empty. Additionally, since `i` is used as the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to reflect the first iteration of the loop. 
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character index of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
