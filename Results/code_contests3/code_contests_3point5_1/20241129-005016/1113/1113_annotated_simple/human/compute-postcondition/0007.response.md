According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity and `res` is an empty list do not affect the loop execution directly. 
So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `T` is greater than 0 and `t` is 0.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0**
