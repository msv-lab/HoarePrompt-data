Example Answer:
The variable `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The value of `nRow` is already updated with the input string where all occurrences of '9' are replaced by '1'. The other variables `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is the input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is the input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'**
