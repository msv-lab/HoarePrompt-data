Example Answer:
`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, and the character at this index determines the value of `nRow`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is incremented by `i` for the loop to execute another time. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`**
