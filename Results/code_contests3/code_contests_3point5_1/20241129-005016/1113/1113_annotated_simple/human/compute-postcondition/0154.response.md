According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `row` and `i`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `res` has appended `nRow`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the character `i` in `row` must be '9' so that `nRow` can contain the updated string after adding '1' at the end. Therefore, for the next iteration, `nRow` should have the updated string after replacing '9' with '1' in the current `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the updated character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` contains the updated string after adding '1' at the end, for the loop to execute the next time `row` is not an empty string**
