Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is not an empty string, `nRow` is updated with the value of `i1` or the sum of its current value and `i1`. The program will update the necessary variables and continue accordingly based on the condition of `i` being equal to '9' or not.***
