Example Answer:
`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. Since the initial value of `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', and the value of `i` is '9', the updated `nRow` will be the original `nRow` with an additional '1' at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` with an additional '1' at the end.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least one element, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1', `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` with an additional '1' at the end**
