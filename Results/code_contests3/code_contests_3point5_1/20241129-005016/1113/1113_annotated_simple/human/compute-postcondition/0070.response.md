According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is 0 which indicates the loop is starting from the beginning of the string. Before the loop starts, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string. So for the loop to be executed, `row` should not be an empty string.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is updated with the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute `row` is not an empty string**
