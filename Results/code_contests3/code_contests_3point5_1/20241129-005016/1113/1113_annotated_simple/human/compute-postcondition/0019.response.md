Example Answer:
The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The initial states of the variables are known - `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, and the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is the index of the next character in `row`, `row` is not an empty string, the character at the new index in `row` determines the value of `nRow`, `nRow` is incremented by `i`**
