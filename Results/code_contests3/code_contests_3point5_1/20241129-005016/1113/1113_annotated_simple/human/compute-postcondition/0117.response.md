Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is updated with the appended value of `nRow`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `i` is updated based on the elements in `row`, `row` has at least two elements, `nRow` is updated based on `row` replacing '9' with '1'. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is the original value of `nRow` with an additional '1' at the end. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is further updated by appending the value of `i`. Additionally, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is appended with another '1'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`.***
