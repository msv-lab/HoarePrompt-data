According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is not an empty string, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is iterating over `row`, so it should be adjusted to the first character of `row`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `res` has appended `nRow`, this indicates that the loop has not executed yet. Therefore, `nRow` should be equal to the first character of `row` for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `res` has appended `nRow`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is not an empty string**.
