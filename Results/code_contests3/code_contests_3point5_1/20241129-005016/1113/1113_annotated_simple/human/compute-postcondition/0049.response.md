According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is 10 which does not directly affect the loop execution. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 9` if i is not equal to '9', otherwise `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended for each '9' encountered in the input string `row`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 10, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` contains the updated `nRow` after appending it, for the loop to execute `row` is not empty**
