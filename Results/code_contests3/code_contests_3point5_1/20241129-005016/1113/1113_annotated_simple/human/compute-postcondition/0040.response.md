According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters left in the `row` string after the current character being iterated. At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 9` if i is not equal to '9', otherwise `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a string input with at least one character. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters left in the `row` string after the current character being iterated, and the loop should not reach the end of the string.
State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 9` if i is not equal to '9', otherwise `res` is a list containing `nRow` with '1' appended, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a string input from the user with at least one character, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more characters left in the `row` string after the current character being iterated**
