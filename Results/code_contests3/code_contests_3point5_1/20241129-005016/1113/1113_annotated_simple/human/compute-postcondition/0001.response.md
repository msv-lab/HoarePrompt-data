Example Answer:
The code snippet registers a lambda function to be executed at exit, which writes the output to the standard output. The initial state consists of t test cases, each represented by a 9x9 grid. The code snippet does not directly affect the test cases or the grid. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **The input consists of t test cases, where each test case is a 9x9 grid represented as a list of 9 strings, each string containing 9 characters from '1' to '9'.**
