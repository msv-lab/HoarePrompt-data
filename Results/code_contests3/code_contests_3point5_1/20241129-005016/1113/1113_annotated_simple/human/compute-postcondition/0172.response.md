Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `nRow` either contains '1' if the character at index `i` in `row` is '9', or it contains the concatenated value of `i` if the character at index `i` in `row` is not '9', `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the first character index of `row`, and `row` contains the input string after stripping. For the loop to execute, `row` is not empty.***
