Example Answer:
`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `nRow` contains the string obtained after replacing all '9's with '1's in `row`, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the last character index of `row`, and `row` contains the input string after stripping. If `row` is empty, `nRow` remains an empty string.
