Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in the input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 2, `i` is the updated character of `row`, `row` contains the input string after stripping, `nRow` contains the updated string after adding '1' at the end, for the loop to execute the next time `row` is not an empty string. If `i` equals '9', the updated character is not added to `nRow`. Otherwise, the updated character `i` is concatenated with `nRow`.***
