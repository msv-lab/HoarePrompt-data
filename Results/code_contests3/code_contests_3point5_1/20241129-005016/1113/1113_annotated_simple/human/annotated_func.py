#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of t test cases, where each test case is a 9x9 grid represented as a list of 9 strings, each string containing 9 characters from '1' to '9'.**
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline

    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):

            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains all the modified rows after replacing '9' with '1' in all input strings, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is `T - 1`, `i` is 9, `row` is the last input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing all '9's with '1's in the last input string and appending any other characters as is.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes t test cases, each represented as a 9x9 grid, by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in each row and outputting the modified grids. The function redirects the standard output to a buffer and writes the modified grids to the output.
