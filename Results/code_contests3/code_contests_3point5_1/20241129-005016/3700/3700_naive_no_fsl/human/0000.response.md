Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem description. The program is not even related to the problem description, as it defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but does not implement the logic to find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do Attack before winning.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
