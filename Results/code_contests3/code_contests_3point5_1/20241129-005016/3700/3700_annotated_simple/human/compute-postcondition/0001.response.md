Example Answer:
The list comprehension calculates the sum of all the elements in the input list after converting them to integers. The `H` and `N` values are assigned from the input split by space. The variables `s` will hold the sum of the values in the list. 
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. `H_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9; `H` and `N` are assigned values from the input split by space. `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input split by space**
