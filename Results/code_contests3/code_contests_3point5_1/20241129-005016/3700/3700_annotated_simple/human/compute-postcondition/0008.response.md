Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads two integers `H` and `N` from the input, then calculates the sum `s` of integers also read from the input. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and it handles the mentioned constraints accurately.**
