The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b, calculates c = a + b, and returns the value of c. If c is greater than or equal to mod, it updates c to its remainder when divided by mod. If c is less than mod, c remains unchanged. The function does not handle cases where mod is not defined or is 0.
