Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not address the problem description given. The functions defined in the program do not solve the problem of determining the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an attack before winning when she can use a special move at most K times.

The first function `func_1` seems to be a generic modular addition operation, which is not relevant to the problem description.

The second function `func_2` reads input values and checks if the sum of the input values is greater than or equal to a given value `H`, which is not related to the problem at hand.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect as it does not implement the solution to the problem description.
