Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The program provided does not address the problem description at all. It defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` that do not relate to the problem statement. The program is supposed to find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an attack before winning, but the given code does not perform any such calculations. Additionally, the functions do not take any inputs or produce any outputs as required by the problem description. Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not solve the given problem.
