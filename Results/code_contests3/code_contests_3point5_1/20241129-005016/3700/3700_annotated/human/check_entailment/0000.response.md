Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not calculate the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. The functions described in the code do not address this specific problem. Additionally, the annotations do not provide clarity on how the code is supposed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description.
