#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. If `c` is the sum of `a` and `b, and `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, there is no change in the initial state of the variables.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of 'c', which is the sum of 'a' and 'b'. If 'c' is greater than or equal to 'mod', then the if block is executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` as `c` and returns the value of `c`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is adjusted by subtracting `mod`. The function does not handle the case when `mod` is not defined or if `a` and `b` are not integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **N and K are integers such that 1 <= N <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= K <= 2 * 10^5. H_i (1 <= i <= N) are integers such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.**
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` and `N` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is the sum of `H` and `N`. If the sum of `H` and `N` is greater than or equal to `H`, then the program prints 'Yes'. If the sum `s` is less than `H`, then the program prints 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input values for heights `H` and `N`, calculates the sum `s` of the heights, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function determines if a tower can be built by stacking exactly `K` blocks with the given heights, but the parameter `K` is missing from the code and annotations.
