The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the sum of `a` and `b` as `c` and returns the value of `c`. If the sum of `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is adjusted by subtracting `mod`. The function does not handle the case when `mod` is not defined or if `a` and `b` are not integers.
