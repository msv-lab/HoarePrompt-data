The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the maximum possible height of a tower that can be built by stacking exactly K blocks. The function uses N blocks with heights H_i (1 <= i <= N) and follows the constraints specified in the precondition. The return value is the maximum possible height of the tower that can be built with the given blocks. 

Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the maximum possible height of a tower that can be built by stacking exactly K blocks using the given N blocks with specified heights, while adhering to the constraints specified in the precondition.**
