Example Answer:
The code calculates the sum of a list created by converting each input value to an integer. The values of `H` and `N` are based on user input, and the sum of these values is stored in variable `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` and `N` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is the sum of `H` and `N`.
Output State: **`H` and `N` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is the sum of `H` and `N`**
