Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input values for heights `H` and `N`, calculates the sum `s` of the heights, and then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function determines if a tower can be built by stacking exactly `K` blocks with the given heights, but the parameter `K` is missing from the code and annotations.**
