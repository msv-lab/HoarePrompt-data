Example Answer:
`H` and `N` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input().split()`. The values of `H` and `N` depend on the input provided. Since the initial state does not provide any specific values, the output state will reflect that `H` and `N` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`H` and `N` are assigned values based on user input**
