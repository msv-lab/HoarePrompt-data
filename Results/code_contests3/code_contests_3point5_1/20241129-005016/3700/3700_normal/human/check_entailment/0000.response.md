Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: 
The code provided does not seem to follow the problem description for every potential case. The program should find the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack (not counting Special Move) before winning when she can use Special Move at most K times. However, the code provided does not implement this logic. It reads the input values of `N` and `K`, but it does not perform any calculations to determine the minimum number of times Fennec needs to do an Attack. Additionally, the output does not provide the expected result based on the problem description.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
