Example Answer:
The `s` variable is assigned the sum of the integers obtained by splitting the input. As per the initial state, `N` and `K` are non-negative integers. Therefore, the sum `s` is calculated based on the input values. 
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers, `H_i` are positive integers, `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input split.**
