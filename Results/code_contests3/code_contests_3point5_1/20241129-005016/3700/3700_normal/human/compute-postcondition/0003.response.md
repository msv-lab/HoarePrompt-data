Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'Yes' to the console. The variables `N`, `K`, `H_i`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are non-negative integers, `H_i` are positive integers, `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input split. The sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are non-negative integers, `H_i` are positive integers, `s` is the sum of integers obtained from the input split. The sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H`**.
