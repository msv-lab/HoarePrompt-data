The function `func_2` reads two non-negative integers `H` and `N`, where `H` is a positive integer and `N` is a non-negative integer. It then calculates the sum of a list of integers based on user input. If the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value.
