The function `func` reads two positive integers as input: Stepan's integer and m, where Stepan's integer has a length between 2 and 200,000 digits inclusive, and m is an integer from 2 to 10^8. It calculates the number of digits in Stepan's integer, performs a series of operations on the integer, and prints the final result. The function does not return any specific output, only processes the input data according to the constraints.
