Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers. If `a` is not divisible by 10, `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `h` remain the same, and `ans` is updated to the minimum between the previous `ans` and the result of `a % b`. If `a` is divisible by 10, `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer, and the new value of `a` is calculated based on the previous values.***
