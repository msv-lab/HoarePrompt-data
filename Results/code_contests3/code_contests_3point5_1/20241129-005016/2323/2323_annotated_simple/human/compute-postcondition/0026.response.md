According to the given code, the loop can execute based on the variables `c` and `h`. If `c` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration, considering the conditions mentioned in the code:
- If a % 10 != 0, then:
    - Update `a` by removing the last digit if a % 10 != 0
    - `b` remains the same
    - Decrement `c` by 1
    - Set `copya` to 0
    - Calculate `ans` as the minimum value between the remainder of updated `a` divided by `b`
    - Update `a` by adding 10 to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` to the previous value of `a`

- If a % 10 == 0, then:
    - Update `a` by adding 10 to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` to the previous value of `a`
    - `b` remains the same
    - Decrement `c` by 1
    - Set `copya` to 0
    - Calculate `ans` as the remainder of `a` divided by `b`
    - Ensure the last digit of `a` is 0
    - `h` is 0

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers.**
