Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers. If a % 10 != 0, then a is updated by removing the last digit, b remains the same, c is decremented by 1, copya is set to 0, ans is the minimum value between the remainder of updated a divided by b, the loop executes as long as c is greater than 0, h is a non-zero digit, a is updated by adding 10 to the power of c multiplied by h to the previous value of a. If a % 10 == 0, then a is updated by adding 10 to the power of c multiplied by h to the previous value of a, b remains the same, c is decremented by 1, copya is set to 0, ans is the remainder of a divided by b, the loop executes as long as c is greater than 0, the last digit of a is 0, h is 0.***
