Example Answer:
`copya` is assigned the value of itself divided by 10 using the floor division operator. Since `copya` is a non-zero value further divisible by 10, after execution, `copya` will have a new value that is 10 times smaller than its previous value but still a non-zero value divisible by 10. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a non-zero value further divisible by 10**
