According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is truthy, which means it is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same value as `a`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be changed to a value that is not equal to 0.
State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is a non-zero value**
