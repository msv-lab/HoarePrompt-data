Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is the input integer provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer**
