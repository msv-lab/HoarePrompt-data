Example Answer: 
`c` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The values of `a`, `b`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is a smaller non-zero value further divisible by 10.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is a smaller non-zero value further divisible by 10**
