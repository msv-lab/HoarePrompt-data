Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `h` are integers. If `a` is not divisible by 10, `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `h` remain unchanged, and `ans` is updated to the minimum between the previous `ans` and the result of `a % b`. If `a` is divisible by 10, `a` is updated to `a // 10`, and `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`.***
