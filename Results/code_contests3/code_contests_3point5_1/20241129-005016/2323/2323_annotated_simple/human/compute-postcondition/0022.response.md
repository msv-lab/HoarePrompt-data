Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` which is 0. The value of `a` is the input integer provided by the user and the last digit is 0. Therefore, after execution, `h` is 0. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0. The last digit of `a` is 0, `h` is 0**
