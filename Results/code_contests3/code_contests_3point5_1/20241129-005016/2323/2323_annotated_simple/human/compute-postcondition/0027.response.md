Example Answer: 
`h` is assigned the value of the remainder of `a` divided by 10. The value of `a` is an integer, so `h` will be the last digit of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
