Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`, where `c` and `h` are integers. The value of `a` is updated based on the previous value of `a`, `c`, and `h`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer, and the new value of `a` is calculated based on the previous values.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer, and the new value of `a` is calculated based on the previous values**
