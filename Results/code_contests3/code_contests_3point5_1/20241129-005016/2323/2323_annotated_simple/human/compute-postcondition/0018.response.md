The value of `a` is updated to be the integer division of `a` by 10. This means that the last digit of `a` is removed. The value of `c` should also be decremented by 1 as we are removing a digit from `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is updated after removing the last digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is a non-zero digit**
