Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` obtained by taking `a % 10`. Since the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will be a non-zero digit. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, and `h` is a non-zero digit.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the input integer `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is a non-zero digit**
