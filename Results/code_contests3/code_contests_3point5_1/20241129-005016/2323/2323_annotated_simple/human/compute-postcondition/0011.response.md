Example Answer: 
`copya` is assigned the value of `copya` divided by 10. Since `copya` is a non-zero value further divisible by 10, after execution, `copya` will have a new value that is a smaller number than the original `copya`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a smaller non-zero value further divisible by 10.
Output State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a smaller non-zero value further divisible by 10**
