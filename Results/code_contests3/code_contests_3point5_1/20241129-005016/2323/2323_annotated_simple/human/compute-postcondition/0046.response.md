The function `func` accepts no parameters. The function is responsible for handling the input data of Stepan's integer and m, where Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits inclusive, and m is an integer where 2 <= m <= 10^8. The function processes the input data and does not return any specific output, as the description only specifies the input constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to process the input data of Stepan's integer and m within the specified constraints.
