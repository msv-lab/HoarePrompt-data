Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `h` are integers. The loop will execute at least once if the number of digits in `a` is greater than 0. If `a` is not divisible by 10, `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `h` will remain the same, and `ans` will be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the result of `a % b`. If `a` is divisible by 10, `a` will be updated to `a // 10`, and `h` will be assigned the value of `a % 10`. The loop will continue until `c` becomes 0. Finally, the value of `ans` will be printed.**
