According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero. 
At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is a non-zero value divided by 10.
For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value that is further divisible by 10.
State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a non-zero value further divisible by 10**
