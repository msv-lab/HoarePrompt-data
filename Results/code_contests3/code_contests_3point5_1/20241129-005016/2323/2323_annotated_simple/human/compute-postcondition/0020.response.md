Example Answer:
`ans` is updated as the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The variables `a` and `b` are involved in this operation, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is updated after removing the last digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the remainder of updated `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is a non-zero digit, `a` is updated as 10 to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` added to the previous value of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is updated after removing the last digit, `b` is an input integer, `c` is decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the remainder of updated `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is a non-zero digit, `a` is updated as 10 to the power of `c` multiplied by `h` added to the previous value of `a`**
