Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of `a` modulo 10. If `a` is 22, then `h` would be 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer**
