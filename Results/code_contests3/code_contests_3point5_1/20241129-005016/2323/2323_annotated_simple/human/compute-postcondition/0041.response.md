Example Answer:
If `a` is divisible by 10, then `a` is updated to be `a // 10` which is the integer division of `a` by 10. If `a` is not divisible by 10, then no changes occur. 
If `a` is divisible by 10, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which is the remainder of `a` divided by 10.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` remain the same if `a` is not divisible by 10. If `a` is divisible by 10, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`.**
