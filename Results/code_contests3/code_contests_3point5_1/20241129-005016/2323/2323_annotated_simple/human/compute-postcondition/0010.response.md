According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, the given states are: `a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is a non-zero value further divisible by 10.

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `copya` should be a non-zero value that is further divisible by 10.

State: **`a` is the input integer provided by the user, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a non-zero value further divisible by 10**
