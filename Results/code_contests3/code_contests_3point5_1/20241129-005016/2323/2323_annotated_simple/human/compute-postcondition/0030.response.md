Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between the current value of `ans` and the result of `a % b`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, and `h` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `h` remain the same, `ans` is updated to the minimum between the previous `ans` and the result of `a % b`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `h` remain the same, `ans` is updated to the minimum between the previous `ans` and the result of `a % b`**
