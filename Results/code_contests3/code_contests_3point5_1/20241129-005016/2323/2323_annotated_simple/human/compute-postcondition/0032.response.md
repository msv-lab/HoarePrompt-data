Example Answer:
`a` is divided by 10 using floor division and the result is assigned back to `a`. The value of `a` is an integer, so after execution, `a` will be the integer part of the division result. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans` are integers, `h` is an integer**
