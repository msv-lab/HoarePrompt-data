Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the last digit of the positive integer `a` by taking the remainder of `a` divided by 10. Since the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will store the value of the last digit. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `h` stores the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` stores the last digit of `a`**
