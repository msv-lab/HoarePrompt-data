According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `copya` is a positive integer equal to `a`. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be adjusted to a value that is not equal to 0.
State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0**
