Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is 1. After execution, `c` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10**
