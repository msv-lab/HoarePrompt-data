According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10. Since `copya` must not be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again, it needs to be adjusted to `copya is a positive integer not equal to 0`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0**
