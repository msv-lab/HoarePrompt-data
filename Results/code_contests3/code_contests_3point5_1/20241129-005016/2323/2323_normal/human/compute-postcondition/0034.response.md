Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `h` stores the last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `a` is an integer after dividing by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is decremented by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 1, `h` stores the last digit of `a`, `a` is assigned the value `10`. If `a % 10 == 0`, then `a` is an integer obtained by appending the last digit of `a` to the left side, `b` is an input integer, `c` is one less than the previous value of `c`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `h` stores the last digit of `a`, `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10.***
