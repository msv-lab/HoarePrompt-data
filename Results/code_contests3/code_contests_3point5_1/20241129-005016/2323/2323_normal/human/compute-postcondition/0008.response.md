Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Since `copya` was a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 100, after the operation, `copya` will be a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10**
