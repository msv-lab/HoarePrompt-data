Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` stores the last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is updated based on the calculation above, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` stores the last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 == 0`, `a` is updated to a new number based on the values of `c` and `h`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the updated number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` is the new last digit of `a`.***
