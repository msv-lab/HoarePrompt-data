Example Answer: 
`copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since it is a positive integer, dividing by 10 will decrease the value by one decimal place. Therefore, after execution, the value of `copya` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 updated after division by 10**
