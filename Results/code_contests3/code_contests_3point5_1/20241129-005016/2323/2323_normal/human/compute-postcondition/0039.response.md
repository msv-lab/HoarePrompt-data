Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The loop will continue as long as `c` is greater than 1. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is the result of floor division of a by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is one less than the previous value of `c`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the new minimum value, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `h` stores the last digit of `a`.**
