According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `c` and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be greater than 1 and `i` needs to be 2. The rest of the states remain the same as mentioned in the given state description.
State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is one less than the previous value of `c`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `h` stores the last digit of `a`.**
