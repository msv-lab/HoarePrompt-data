According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `c`. If `c` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `c` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
