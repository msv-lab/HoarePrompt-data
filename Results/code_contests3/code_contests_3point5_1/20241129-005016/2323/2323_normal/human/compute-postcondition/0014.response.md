Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. `a` is a positive integer, `b` is the input integer, so the value of `ans` will be the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`**
