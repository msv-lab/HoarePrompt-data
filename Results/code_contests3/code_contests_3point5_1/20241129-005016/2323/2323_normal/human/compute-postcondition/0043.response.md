Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are integers. If `a` % 10 != 0, then `a` is updated to the result of floor division of a by 10, `b` remains an input integer, `c` is one less than the previous value of `c`, `copya` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to the new minimum value, for the loop to execute `c` must be greater than 1, `i` is set to 2, `h` stores the last digit of `a`. If `a` % 10 == 0, then `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, `b` remains an input integer, `c` is one less than the previous value of `c`, `copya` remains 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of the previous value of `a` divided by `b`, `c` must be greater than 1, `i` is set to 2, `h` stores the last digit of the previous value of `a`.***
