Example Answer:
The last digit of `a` is calculated by finding the remainder of `a` divided by 10, and it is stored in `h`. The value of `a` is not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `h` stores the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `h` stores the last digit of `a`**
