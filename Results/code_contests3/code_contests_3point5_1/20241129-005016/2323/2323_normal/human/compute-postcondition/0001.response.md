Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer**
