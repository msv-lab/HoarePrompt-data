According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` should be adjusted to a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 100. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Output State: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is a positive integer not equal to 0 divided by 100**
