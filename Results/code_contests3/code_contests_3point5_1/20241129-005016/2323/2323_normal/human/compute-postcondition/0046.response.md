The function `func` accepts two positive integer parameters: Stepan's integer and m. Stepan's integer is a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and m is a positive integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive). The function does not return any value, as the output requirements are not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept Stepan's integer and m as input parameters within the specified constraints.
