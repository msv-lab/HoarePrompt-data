Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` obtained by modulo division by 10. The value of `a` is an integer, so `h` will be an integer containing the last digit of `a`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer containing the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer containing the last digit of `a`**
