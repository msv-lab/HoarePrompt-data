Example Answer:
`a` is divided by 10 using the floor division operator `//`. The value of `a` changes accordingly. The value of `h` will also change as it contains the last digit of `a`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer containing the last digit of the new value of `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer containing the last digit of the new value of `a`**
