Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` after performing the modulo operation with 10. The value of `a` is an integer, so `h` will be an integer representing the last digit of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer representing the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer representing the last digit of `a`**
