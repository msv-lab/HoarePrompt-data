Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, which means the last digit of `copya` is removed. If `copya` was initially 123, after executing `copya //= 10`, `copya` becomes 12. Since `copya` is updated and not equal to 0, the loop will execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` should not be equal to 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` should not be equal to 0**
