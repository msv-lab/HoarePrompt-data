Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` should not be equal to 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` should not be equal to 0**
