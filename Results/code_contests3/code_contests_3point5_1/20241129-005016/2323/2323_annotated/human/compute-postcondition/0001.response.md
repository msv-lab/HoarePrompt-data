Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is not mentioned in the code snippet, so the output state is: the value of `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **The value of `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer**
