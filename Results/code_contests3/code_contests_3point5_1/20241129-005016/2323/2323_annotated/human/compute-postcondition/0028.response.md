Example Answer: 
The value of `a` is divided by 10 using the `//=` operator, which effectively removes the last digit of `a`. Since `h` is the last digit of `a`, after execution, `h` will be updated to the new last digit of `a`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the new last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`h` is the new last digit of `a`**
