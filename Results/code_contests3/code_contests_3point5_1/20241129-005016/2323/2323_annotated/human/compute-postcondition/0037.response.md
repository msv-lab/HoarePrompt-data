Example Answer:
`a` is updated to the result of `a` divided by 10 using integer division. The value of `a` changes accordingly, and `h` remains the same as it represents the last digit of the updated `a`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, `c` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, `h` is an integer representing the last digit of the updated `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is an integer representing the last digit of the updated `a`**
