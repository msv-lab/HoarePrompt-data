Example Answer:
The value of `c` is initialized to 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is initialized to 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is initialized to 0**
