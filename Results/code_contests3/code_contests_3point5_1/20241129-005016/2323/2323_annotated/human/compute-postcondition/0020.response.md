Example Answer:
`ans` is reassigned the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `i`, and `h` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the result of dividing the original `a` by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is decreased by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.
Output State: **`a` is the result of dividing the original `a` by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is decreased by 1, `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`**
