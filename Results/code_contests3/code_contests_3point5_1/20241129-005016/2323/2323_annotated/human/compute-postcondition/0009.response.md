Example Answer:
`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` should not be equal to 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10, for the loop to execute again `copya` should not be equal to 0**
