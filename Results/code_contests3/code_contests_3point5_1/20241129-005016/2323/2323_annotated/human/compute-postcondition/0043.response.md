Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is updated based on the value of `c` and `h`, where `b`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged. `c` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. `h` represents the last digit of the updated `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. If `a % 10 == 0`, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`, and `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged.***
