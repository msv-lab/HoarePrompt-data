Example Answer:
`h` is assigned the value of the last digit of `a` obtained by performing `a % 10`. The value of `a` is based on user input, so the value of `h` depends on the input provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `c` is greater than 0, `h` is the last digit of `a`**
