Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `h` is the new last digit of `a`. If `a % 10 == 0`, the value of `a` is updated to `a // 10` and modified with the added expression based on the last digit. In both cases, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unaffected. For the loop to execute, `c` should be greater than 0, and the state remains consistent for the next iteration.***
