Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers. If `a % 10 != 0`, `a` is updated to the result of dividing the original `a` by 10, `b` remains the same, `c` is decreased by 1, `copya` remains 0, `ans` is updated, `i` remains 0, for the loop to execute `c` should be greater than 0, `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`. If `a % 10 == 0`, `a` is updated to its value divided by 10, `b` remains the same, `c` is decreased by 1, `copya` remains 0, `ans` is the remainder of the updated `a` divided by `b`, `i` remains 0, for the loop to execute `c` should be greater than 0, and `h` is the last digit of the updated `a`.***
