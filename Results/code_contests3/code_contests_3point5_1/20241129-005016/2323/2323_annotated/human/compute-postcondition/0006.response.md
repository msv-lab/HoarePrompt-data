Example Answer:
The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10**
