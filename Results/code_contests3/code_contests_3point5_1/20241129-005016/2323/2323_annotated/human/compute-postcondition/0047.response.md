Functionality: **The function takes two positive integers as input: Stepan's very big positive integer `a` and an integer `b` representing the divisor. It calculates the number of digits in `a` and then iterates over each digit to find the minimum remainder when `a` is shifted. The final output is the minimum remainder calculated during the process.**
