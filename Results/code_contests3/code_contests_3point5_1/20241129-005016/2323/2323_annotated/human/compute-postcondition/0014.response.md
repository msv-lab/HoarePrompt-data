Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `a` modulo `b`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are based on user input, so `ans` will be the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The variables `c` and `copya` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`**
