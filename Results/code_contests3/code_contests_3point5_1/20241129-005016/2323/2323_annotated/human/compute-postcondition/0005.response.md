Example Answer:
`copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10. The value of `copya` is changed based on the initial value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is initialized to 0, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10.
Output State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is initialized to 0, `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10**
