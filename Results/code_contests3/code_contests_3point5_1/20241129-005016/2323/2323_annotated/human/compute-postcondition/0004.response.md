According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` evaluates to True, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is initialized to 0, `copya` is a copy of `a`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `a` needs to be such that it evaluates to True. This means `a` should not be 0 or an empty value.

State: **`a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is initialized to 0, `copya` is a copy of `a` and for the loop to execute the first time, `a` should evaluate to True**
