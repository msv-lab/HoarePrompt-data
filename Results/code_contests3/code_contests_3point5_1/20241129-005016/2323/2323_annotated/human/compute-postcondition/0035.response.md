According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `c` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` should still be greater than 0.
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i` are all integers, for the loop to execute again `c` should be greater than 0**
