#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input consists of two positive integers, the first integer represents Stepan's very big positive integer and the second integer represents the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros. The second integer m is such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = 0
    copya = a
    while copya:
        copya //= 10
        
        c += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0
    ans = a % b
    for i in range(c):
        if a % 10 != 0:
            h = a % 10
            a //= 10
            a = 10 ** c * h + a
            ans = min(ans, a % b)
        else:
            h = a % 10
            a //= 10
            a = 10 ** c * h + a
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are all integers. The final values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, and `h` depend on the initial values of `a` and `b`, and the operations performed within the loop. The loop will execute for each digit in `a` as long as `c` is greater than 0. The final values of these variables will be determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `a` will be modified based on the digits of the original `a`, `b` will remain the same, `c` will be decreased to 0, `copya` will remain 0, `ans` will be updated based on the minimum remainder calculated, and `h` will represent the last digit of the final updated `a`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two positive integers as input: Stepan's very big positive integer `a` and an integer `b` representing the divisor. It calculates the number of digits in `a` and then iterates over each digit to find the minimum remainder when `a` is shifted. The final output is the minimum remainder calculated during the process.
