You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Stepan has a very big positive integer.

Let's consider all cyclic shifts of Stepan's integer (if we look at his integer like at a string) which are also integers (i.e. they do not have leading zeros). Let's call such shifts as good shifts. For example, for the integer 10203 the good shifts are the integer itself 10203 and integers 20310 and 31020.

Stepan wants to know the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts. Your task is to determine the minimum remainder of the division by m.

Input

The first line contains the integer which Stepan has. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200 000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros.

The second line contains the integer m (2 ≤ m ≤ 108) — the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer.

Output

Print the minimum remainder which Stepan can get if he divides all good shifts of his integer by the given number m.

Note

In the first example all good shifts of the integer 521 (good shifts are equal to 521, 215 and 152) has same remainder 2 when dividing by 3.

In the second example there are only two good shifts: the Stepan's integer itself and the shift by one position to the right. The integer itself is 1001 and the remainder after dividing it by 5 equals 1. The shift by one position to the right equals to 1100 and the remainder after dividing it by 5 equals 0, which is the minimum possible remainder.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: The input consists of two positive integers, the first integer represents Stepan's very big positive integer and the second integer represents the number by which Stepan divides good shifts of his integer. The length of Stepan's integer is between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive. It is guaranteed that Stepan's integer does not contain leading zeros. The second integer m is such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = 0
    copya = a
    while copya:
        copya //= 10
        
        c += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is assigned based on user input, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0
    ans = a % b
    for i in range(c):
        if a % 10 != 0:
            h = a % 10
            a //= 10
            a = 10 ** c * h + a
            ans = min(ans, a % b)
        else:
            h = a % 10
            a //= 10
            a = 10 ** c * h + a
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, `h` are all integers. The final values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `copya`, `ans`, `i`, and `h` depend on the initial values of `a` and `b`, and the operations performed within the loop. The loop will execute for each digit in `a` as long as `c` is greater than 0. The final values of these variables will be determined by the last iteration of the loop, where `a` will be modified based on the digits of the original `a`, `b` will remain the same, `c` will be decreased to 0, `copya` will remain 0, `ans` will be updated based on the minimum remainder calculated, and `h` will represent the last digit of the final updated `a`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two positive integers as input: Stepan's very big positive integer `a` and an integer `b` representing the divisor. It calculates the number of digits in `a` and then iterates over each digit to find the minimum remainder when `a` is shifted. The final output is the minimum remainder calculated during the process.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
