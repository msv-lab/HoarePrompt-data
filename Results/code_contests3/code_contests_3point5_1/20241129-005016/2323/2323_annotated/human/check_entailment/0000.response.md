Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two positive integers as input, calculates the number of digits in the integer, and then iterates over each digit to find the minimum remainder when the integer is shifted. The final output is the minimum remainder calculated during the process.

The implementation ensures that all good shifts of the integer are considered, as it goes through each digit and performs the necessary calculations. The program correctly identifies the minimum remainder of the division by the given number among all good shifts, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
