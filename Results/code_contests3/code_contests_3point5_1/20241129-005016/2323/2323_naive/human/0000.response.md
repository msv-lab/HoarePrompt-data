Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the minimum remainder of the division by the given number m among all good shifts of Stepan's integer. It iterates through all possible good shifts and finds the minimum remainder. The logic of shifting the integer and updating the remainder is implemented correctly. The program handles the case where the integer has leading zeros and ensures that all good shifts are considered. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
