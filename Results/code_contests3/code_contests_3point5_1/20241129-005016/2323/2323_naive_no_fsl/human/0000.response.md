Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for Stepan's integer and the number by which he wants to divide the good shifts.
2. The program calculates the minimum remainder of the division for all good shifts of Stepan's integer.
3. The program correctly handles the shifting of the integer to find all good shifts.
4. The program uses a loop to iterate through all possible shifts and updates the minimum remainder accordingly.
5. The program outputs the minimum remainder as required by the problem description.
6. The logic and implementation of the program align with the problem description and the provided examples.
