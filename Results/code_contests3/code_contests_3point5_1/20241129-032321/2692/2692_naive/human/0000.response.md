Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the ticket number is a lucky number. The program only checks if the sum of the digits in the first half equals the sum of the digits in the second half, but it does not check if the ticket number itself is a lucky number. For example, if the ticket number is "4444", the program would output "YES" even though "4444" is not a lucky number.
