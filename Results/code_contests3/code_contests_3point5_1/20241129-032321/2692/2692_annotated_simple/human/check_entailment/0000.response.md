Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully implement the problem description. 
1. The program does not check whether the ticket number is a lucky number (contains only 4s and 7s).
2. The program does not check if the ticket number length is even as required by the problem description.
3. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`.
4. The program does not handle the case where the sum of the first half of the ticket number digits is not equal to the sum of the second half. The program should output "NO" in this case according to the problem description.

Overall, the program does not fully implement the requirements of the problem description.
