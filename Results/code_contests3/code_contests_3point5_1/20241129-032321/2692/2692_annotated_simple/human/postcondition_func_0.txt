The function reads an even integer `n` from the input, along with a list of integers represented by `digits`. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the `digits` array is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, the function's behavior is unspecified. If the sums are not equal, it prints 'NO'.
