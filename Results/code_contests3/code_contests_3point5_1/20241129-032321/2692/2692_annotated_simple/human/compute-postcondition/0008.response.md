Postcondition: ***n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50. The digits array contains the integer values of the characters in the input string. If the sum of the first half of the digits array is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits array, the function's behavior is unspecified. If the sum of the first half of digits is not equal to the sum of the second half of digits, 'NO' is printed.***
