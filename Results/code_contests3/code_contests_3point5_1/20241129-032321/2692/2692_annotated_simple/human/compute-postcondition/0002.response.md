Example Answer:
The program reads a string input and maps each character to an integer using the `map` function. However, the function `raw_input()` is outdated and should be replaced with `input()` in Python 3. Since the input is a string, the resulting `digits` variable will be a map object containing the integer values of the characters in the input string.
Output State: **n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a map object containing the integer values of the characters in the input string**
