Correctness: **True**

The program reads an even integer `n` representing the length of a ticket number and a list of integers `digits` representing the ticket number. It then checks if the sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half of digits. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which states that a ticket is lucky if it is a lucky number and the sum of the digits in the first half equals the sum of the digits in the second half. The program also correctly handles the input constraints mentioned in the problem description.
