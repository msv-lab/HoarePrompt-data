Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an even integer `n` representing the length of a ticket number and a list of integers `digits` representing the ticket number. It then checks if the sum of the first half of digits is equal to the sum of the second half of digits. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program assumes the ticket number has a valid length of `n` and does not handle cases where `n` is odd or outside the range of 2 to 50.**
