Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the ticket number needs to be checked if it is a lucky number. The program only checks if the sum of digits in the first half equals the sum of digits in the second half of the ticket number. Additionally, the program does not check if the ticket number is a lucky number (contains only 4 and 7).

For example, if the input is:
```
4
1234
```
The program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks the sum of digits in the first half equals the sum of digits in the second half, but it does not consider the requirement of the ticket number being a lucky number.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
