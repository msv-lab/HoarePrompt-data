Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each character in the stripped input. Since the input is expected to be a string of digits, the `map(int, ...)` function will convert each character to an integer. As a result, `digits` will be a list of integers representing each digit in the input string. The value of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers extracted from the input string.
Output State: **n is a positive even integer such that 2 <= n <= 50; digits is a list of integers extracted from the input string**
