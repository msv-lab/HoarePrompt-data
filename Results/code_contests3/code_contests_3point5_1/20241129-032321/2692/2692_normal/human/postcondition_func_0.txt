The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a sequence of integers of length `n` from the user. It then compares whether the sum of the first half of the sequence is equal to the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly but relies on user input for `n` and the sequence of integers.
