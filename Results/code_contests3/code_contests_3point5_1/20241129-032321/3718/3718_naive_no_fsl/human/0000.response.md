Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum detection radius for the radar based on the input provided. It calculates the distance between the two cities, checks the different scenarios of the cities and flatland rings positions, and calculates the minimum radius accordingly. The formula used to calculate the minimum radius is also correct based on the problem description. The output is formatted correctly to have up to 6 decimal places. Overall, the program seems to be handling all potential cases correctly as per the problem description.
