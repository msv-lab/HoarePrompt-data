Correctness: **True**

The program calculates the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) correctly using the formula sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2). This is exactly what is required in the problem description to calculate the distance between the city and the flatland ring. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
