Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, representing the coordinates of two points. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points using the formula sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2). The function ensures that the coordinates of the points are within the range -10^4 and 10^4.**
