Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given their coordinates. This function is used to calculate the distance between the city and the flatland ring in the problem description. Since the program accurately calculates the distance between two points, it correctly implements the key functionality required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
