#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **x1, y1, x2, y2 are integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| <= 10^4.**
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of two points and calculates the Euclidean distance between them using the distance formula. The function returns the calculated Euclidean distance. No edge cases or missing functionality observed in the provided code.
