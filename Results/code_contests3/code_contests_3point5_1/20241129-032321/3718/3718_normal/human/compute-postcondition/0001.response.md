The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: x1, y1, x2, y2, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints -10^4 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 10^4 and x1 != x2 or y1 != y2. After executing the function body, the program returns the Euclidean distance between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing two points in a 2D plane and calculate and return the Euclidean distance between these two points. 
Functionality: **The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, y2 representing two points in a 2D plane and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points.**
