Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for the city and the flatland ring.
- The `func_1` function correctly calculates the Euclidean distance between the two points using the distance formula.
- The code then calculates the minimum detection radius `r` based on the conditions provided in the problem description.
- The output is formatted to display the value of `r` with 6 decimal places.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including when the sum of the radii is less than the distance between the two points, and when the absolute difference of the radii is greater than the distance between the two points.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
