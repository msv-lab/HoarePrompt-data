Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the described algorithm for sorting the ravioli stacks. It iterates through the input array and checks if there is a height difference of 2 or more between adjacent stacks. If a difference is found, it sets the flag to False and breaks out of the loop. Then, it removes the tallest stack and continues the process until all stacks are removed. Finally, it outputs "YES" if the flag is True, indicating that the array can be sorted using the described procedure, and "NO" otherwise.

The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and correctly determines whether the input array can be sorted using the algorithm.
