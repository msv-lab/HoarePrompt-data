The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` and an array `ai` containing `n` positive integers. It then iterates through the array elements, checking if there exists a pair with an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair is found, it sets `flag` to False; otherwise, it remains True. The function does not return any specific value but prints 'YES' if flag is True and 'NO' if flag is False.
