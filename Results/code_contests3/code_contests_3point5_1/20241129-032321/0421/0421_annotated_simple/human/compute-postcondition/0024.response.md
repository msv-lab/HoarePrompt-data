Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean set to True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is an integer initialized to 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
