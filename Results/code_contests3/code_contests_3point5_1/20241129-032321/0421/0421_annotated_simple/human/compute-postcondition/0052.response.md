Example Answer:
Initially, `nums` is a non-empty list with elements removed based on certain conditions. If there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, `flag` is False; otherwise, `flag` remains True. Based on the value of `flag`, either 'NO' or 'YES' will be printed. After executing the code, the output will be either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.
Output State: **Either 'NO' or 'YES' will be printed based on the value of `flag`**
