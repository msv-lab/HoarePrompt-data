According to the code, the loop can execute if both `flag` and `nums` are True. Right before the loop, `flag` is True. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `nums` must also be True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is True**
