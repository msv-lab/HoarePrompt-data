Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
