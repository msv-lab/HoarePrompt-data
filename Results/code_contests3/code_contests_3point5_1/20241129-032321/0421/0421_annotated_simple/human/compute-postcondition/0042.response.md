Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables `nums` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 2.
Output State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 2**
