Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts user input. The value of `n` is now whatever the user inputs. The array `ai` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the array ai contains n positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the array ai contains n positive integers**
