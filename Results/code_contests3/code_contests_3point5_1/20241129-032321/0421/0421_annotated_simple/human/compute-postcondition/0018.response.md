Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. This action does not affect the value of `flag`. Since `nums` still has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum, the condition for `flag` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, otherwise `flag` remains True.
Output State: **`flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, otherwise `flag` remains True**
