According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `len(nums)` is greater than or equal to 2. Since the loop is iterating over `len(nums) - 1`, it requires at least 2 elements in the `nums` list to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
