Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
