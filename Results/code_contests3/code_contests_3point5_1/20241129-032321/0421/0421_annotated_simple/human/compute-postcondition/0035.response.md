According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True if there are no pairs of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, and `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition of `flag` being True needs to be maintained and `nums` should not be empty.
State: **`flag` is True if there are no pairs of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more; `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty**
