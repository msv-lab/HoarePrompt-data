According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `nums` is not empty. The loop will iterate from 0 to len(nums)-2. Since `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, we need to ensure that `flag` remains True for the loop to execute. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` will be 0.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute**
