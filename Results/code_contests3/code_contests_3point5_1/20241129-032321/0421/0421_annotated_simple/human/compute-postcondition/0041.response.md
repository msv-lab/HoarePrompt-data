According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, and `i` is an integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than the length of `nums` minus 2.
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 2**
