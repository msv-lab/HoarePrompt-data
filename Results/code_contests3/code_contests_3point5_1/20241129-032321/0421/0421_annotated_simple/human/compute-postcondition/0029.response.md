According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the `nums` list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, no changes occur. 
To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition for the loop to execute again should be checked based on the updated `i`.
State: **`flag` is a boolean set to True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is an integer incremented by 1**.
