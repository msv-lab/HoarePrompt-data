According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty.
State: **`flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty**
