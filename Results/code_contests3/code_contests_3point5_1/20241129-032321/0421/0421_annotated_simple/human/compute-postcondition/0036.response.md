According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the length of `nums` is at least 2. The loop will iterate over the indices of `nums` up to the second to last element. Before the loop starts, `flag` is True ensures that the loop will execute. So, for the loop to execute, `flag` needs to be True and `nums` should not be empty, and `i` should be 0.
State: **`flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, for the loop to execute `nums` should not be empty, `i` is 0**
