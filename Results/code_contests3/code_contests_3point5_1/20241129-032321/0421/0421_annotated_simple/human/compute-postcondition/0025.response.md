According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the `nums` list minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list, and `i` is an integer. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`flag` is a boolean set to True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is an integer incremented by 1**
