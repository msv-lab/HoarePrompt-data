Example Answer:
`nums` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input obtained from `raw_input().split()`. Since we are not provided with the actual input values, the specific values of `nums` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `flag` is True.
Output State: **`flag` is True**
