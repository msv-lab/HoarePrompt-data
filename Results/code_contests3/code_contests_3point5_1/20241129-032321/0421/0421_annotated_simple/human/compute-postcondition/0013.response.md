According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `nums[i]`, and `nums[i + 1]`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must be greater than or equal to 2**
