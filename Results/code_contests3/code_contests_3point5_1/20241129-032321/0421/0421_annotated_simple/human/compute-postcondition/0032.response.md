Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean set to True or False, `nums` is a non-empty list, `i` is an integer incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop is exited. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
