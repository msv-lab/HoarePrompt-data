According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums`, `i`, and `flag`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` must be less than 2.
State: **`flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time the absolute difference between `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` must be less than 2**
