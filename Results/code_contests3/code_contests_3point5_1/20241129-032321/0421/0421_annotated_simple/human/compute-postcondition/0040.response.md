Postcondition: ***`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
