According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`flag` is a boolean, `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, `i` is an integer less than the length of `nums` minus 1**
