Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum element from the list `nums`. Since `nums` is a non-empty list with the maximum element removed, the new list `nums` will have one less element than before. The state of the variable `flag` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`flag` is False if there exists a pair of elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, `nums` is a non-empty list with one less element**
