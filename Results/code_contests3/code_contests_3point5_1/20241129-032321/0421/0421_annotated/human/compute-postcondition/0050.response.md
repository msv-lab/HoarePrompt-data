Example Answer:
The maximum value is removed from the list `nums`. The variable `i` is updated to `len(nums) - 2`. The flag remains the same based on the elements in the updated `nums` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100 except for the maximum value which has been removed, `flag` is True if all elements in `nums` are within a difference of 1, and flag is False if there is an absolute difference of 2 or more between any two elements in `nums`, `nums` is a list with the maximum value removed, `i` is updated to `len(nums) - 2`.
Output State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100 except for the maximum value which has been removed, `flag` is True if all elements in `nums` are within a difference of 1, and flag is False if there is an absolute difference of 2 or more between any two elements in `nums`, `nums` is a list with the maximum value removed, `i` is updated to `len(nums) - 2`**
