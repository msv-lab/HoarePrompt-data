Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` as the size of an array and a list of `n` positive integers. It then iterates through the list to check if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements is less than 2. If this condition holds for all elements, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. However, the annotation mentions the removal of the maximum value from the list, which is missing in the code implementation.**
