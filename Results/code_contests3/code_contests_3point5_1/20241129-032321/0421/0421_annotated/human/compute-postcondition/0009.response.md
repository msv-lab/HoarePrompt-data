According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `nums` must not be empty and `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums - 1`.
State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty, nums is not empty, i is less than len(nums) - 1**
