Example Answer: 
The map function is used to convert each element in the input array to an integer. Since the input is taken using raw_input(), the values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the output state is: n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, and nums is a map object of integers after conversion.
Output State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, nums is a map object of integers after conversion**
