According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map object of integers after conversion. Since `flag` is already True, the only condition to be met for the loop to execute one more time is that `nums` should not be empty.
State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty**
