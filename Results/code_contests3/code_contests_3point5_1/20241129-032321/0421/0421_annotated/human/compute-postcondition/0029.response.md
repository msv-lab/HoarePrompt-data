According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100 except for the maximum value which has been removed, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is less than the length of `nums`, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2**.
