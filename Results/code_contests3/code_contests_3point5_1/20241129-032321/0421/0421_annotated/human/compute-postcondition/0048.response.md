Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of `n` positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100 except for the maximum value which has been removed, `flag` is True if all elements in `nums` are within a difference of 1, and flag is False if there is an absolute difference of 2 or more between any two elements in `nums`, `nums` is a list with the maximum value removed, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` must be less than 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop is exited.***
