Example Answer:
`flag` is assigned the value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True.
Output State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True**
