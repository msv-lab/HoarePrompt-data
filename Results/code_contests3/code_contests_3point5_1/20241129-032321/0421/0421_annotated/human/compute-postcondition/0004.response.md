According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If nums has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that nums is not empty. 
State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty**
