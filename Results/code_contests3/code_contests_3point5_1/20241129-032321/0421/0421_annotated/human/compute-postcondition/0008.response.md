Postcondition: ***n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, flag is False, nums is empty, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
