Postcondition: ***n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is either True or False, nums is not empty, i is less than len(nums) - 2. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2, flag is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
