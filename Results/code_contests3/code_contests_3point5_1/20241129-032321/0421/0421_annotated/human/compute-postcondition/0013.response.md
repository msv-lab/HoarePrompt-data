According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must still not be empty, and `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1` after incrementing by 1.
State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100, flag is True, for the loop to execute the first time nums is not empty, nums is not empty, i is less than len(nums) - 1, for the loop to execute one more time nums is not empty, i is less than len(nums) - 2**
