According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions are as follows: `n` is a string representing the size of the array, `ai` is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100 except for the maximum value which has been removed, `flag` is True if all elements in nums are within a difference of 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the `flag` needs to remain True and `nums` should not be empty.

State: **n is a string representing the size of the array, ai is a list of n positive integers each ranging from 1 to 100 except for the maximum value which has been removed, flag is True if all elements in nums are within a difference of 1 and for the loop to execute again, flag needs to be True and nums should not be empty**
