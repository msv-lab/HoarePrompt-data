Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully implement the algorithm described in the problem description. It checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the input array is less than 2, and based on that, it outputs "YES" or "NO". However, it does not actually simulate the process of sorting ravioli stacks as described in the problem.

Additionally, the program is missing the part where it should actually perform the ravioli sorting algorithm with the described rules, such as removing the tallest stack, shifting stacks, and handling cases where ravioli slides from a taller stack to a shorter one.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
