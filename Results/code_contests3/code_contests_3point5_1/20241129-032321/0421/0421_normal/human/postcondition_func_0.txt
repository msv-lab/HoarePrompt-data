The `func` function implicitly accepts a positive integer `n` representing the size of an array and a list `ai` of `n` positive integers representing the height of a stack of ravioli. The function then reads input, processes the heights of the ravioli stacks, and determines whether the absolute difference between adjacent elements is less than 2. If the condition holds for all elements, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
