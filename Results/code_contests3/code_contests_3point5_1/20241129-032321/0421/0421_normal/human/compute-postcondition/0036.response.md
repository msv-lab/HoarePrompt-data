According to the code, the loop can execute if `nums` is not empty. Since the maximum element has been removed, `nums` should have at least one element left to satisfy the condition. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer and `ai` being a list of positive integers does not directly impact the loop execution. The flag being True also does not affect the loop execution condition. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `nums` is not empty and `i` starts from 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute again `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
