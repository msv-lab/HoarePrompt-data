According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is not greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. Since no changes occurred in the flag, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
