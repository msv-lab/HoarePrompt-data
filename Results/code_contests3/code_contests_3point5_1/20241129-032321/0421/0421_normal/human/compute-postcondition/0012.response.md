Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1. If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) is greater or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the initial state.***
