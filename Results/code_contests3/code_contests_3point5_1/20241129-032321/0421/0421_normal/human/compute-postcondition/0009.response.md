According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nums` is not empty. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `nums` must still not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1, If abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) is greater or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
