Example Answer:
The code removes the maximum element in `nums`. Since there are no conditions that check for adjacent elements with an absolute difference of at least 2, the maximum element is removed unconditionally. Therefore, after execution, the maximum element in `nums` is removed regardless of the initial values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True. The maximum element in `nums` has been removed.**
