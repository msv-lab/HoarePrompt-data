According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1. Therefore, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2**
