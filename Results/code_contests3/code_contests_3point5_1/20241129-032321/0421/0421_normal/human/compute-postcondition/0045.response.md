According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nums` and `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` should still not be empty, and `i` should be less than the length of `nums` - 1. Since `i` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again `i` should be incremented by 1 making it 2. Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute a second time `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2**
