According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `nums` is not empty. The loop will iterate over the range of length of `nums` - 1. So, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
