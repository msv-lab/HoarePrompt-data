According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `nums`, `i`, and `flag`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` - 1 and `flag` is not False, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, the maximum element in `nums` has been removed, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 0. 
To execute the loop one more time, the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2` must not be met, and `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute again `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1**
