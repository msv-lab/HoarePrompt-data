Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, `nums` is not empty, `i` is the last index of `nums - 1` and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` for the last iteration is less than 2, then `flag` remains True. Otherwise, `flag` becomes False.
