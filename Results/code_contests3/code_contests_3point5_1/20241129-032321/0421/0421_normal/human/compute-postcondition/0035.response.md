According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, and `flag` is True. However, the maximum element in `nums` has been removed. To execute the loop one more time, `nums` should not be empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute again `nums` should not be empty**
