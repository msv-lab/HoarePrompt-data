According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the maximum element in `nums` is removed if there are no adjacent elements with an absolute difference of at least 2, so the adjustment needed is that `nums` has at least 2 elements and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
