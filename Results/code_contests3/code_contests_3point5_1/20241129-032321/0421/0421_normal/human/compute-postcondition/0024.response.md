Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False. Otherwise, no changes occur and the loop continues as normal.***
