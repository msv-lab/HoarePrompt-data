Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute a second time `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[i + 1] is greater than or equal to 2, then `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is False, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute a second time `nums` is not empty, and `i` is 2. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
