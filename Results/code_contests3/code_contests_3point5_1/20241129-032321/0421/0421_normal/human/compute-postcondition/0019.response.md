According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. If `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, and `nums` is not empty. If there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of at least 2, then `flag` is False. Otherwise, `flag` remains True, and the maximum element in `nums` is removed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the maximum element in `nums` must be removed, and if there are no adjacent elements with an absolute difference of at least 2 in `nums`, the `flag` should remain True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is True, the maximum element in `nums` is removed if there are no adjacent elements with an absolute difference of at least 2**
