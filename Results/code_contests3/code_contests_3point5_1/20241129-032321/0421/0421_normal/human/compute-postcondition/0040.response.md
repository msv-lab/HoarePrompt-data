Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ai` is a list of positive integers, `flag` is either True or False, maximum element in `nums` has been removed, for the loop to execute again `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` becomes False and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
