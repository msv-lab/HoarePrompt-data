Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `i`, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers with length n where each element is either 0 or 1, `comps` is a list of n elements where `comps[i]` is equal to 0 for some index i and `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is 1, `j` is assigned the value of `i`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers with length n where each element is either 0 or 1, `comps` is a list of n elements where `comps[i]` is equal to 0 for some index i and `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, `col` is 1, `j` is assigned the value of `i`**
