Output State: **n is a positive integer, p is a list of integers with length n, b is a list of integers with length n, comps is a list of n elements where each element is assigned the value of col, i is incremented by 2, j is assigned the value of p[i+1], comps[p[j-1]] is equal to 0, comps[j] is equal to col, for the loop to execute again j satisfies the condition comps[p[j]] == 0, j is updated to the value stored at index p[j].**
