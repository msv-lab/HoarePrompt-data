Example Answer: 
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is updated based on the previous value of `j` and `p`, and the length of `comps` is n. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements where for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, `j` is updated to a new value based on the previous value of `j` and `p`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements where for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is non-zero, `j` is updated to a new value based on the previous value of `j` and `p`**
