Example Answer:
A list named `comps` is created with n elements, each initialized to 0. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequences `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length n where each element in `p` is between 0 and n-1, each element in `b` is either 0 or 1, and a new list `comps` is created with n elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequences `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length n where each element in `p` is between 0 and n-1, each element in `b` is either 0 or 1, and a new list `comps` is created with n elements initialized to 0**
