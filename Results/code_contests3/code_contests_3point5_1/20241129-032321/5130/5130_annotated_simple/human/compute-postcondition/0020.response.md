Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers with length n where each element is either 0 or 1, `comps` is a list of n elements initialized to 0, `col` is 0. If `comps[i]` is 0, then all elements of `comps` have been assigned the value of `col` and `j` is the last valid index based on the values in list `p`.***
