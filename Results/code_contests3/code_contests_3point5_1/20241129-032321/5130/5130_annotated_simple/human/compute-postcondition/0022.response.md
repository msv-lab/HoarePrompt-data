Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n where each element is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers with length n where each element is either 0 or 1, `comps` is a list of n elements initialized to 0, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is the last valid index based on the values in list `p`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than n**.
