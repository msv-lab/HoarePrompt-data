According to the code, the loop will execute n times as it iterates through the range of n. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, each element in `p` is between 0 and n-1, `b` is a list of integers with length n where each element is either 0 or 1, `comps` is a list of n elements initialized to 0, `col` is 0**
