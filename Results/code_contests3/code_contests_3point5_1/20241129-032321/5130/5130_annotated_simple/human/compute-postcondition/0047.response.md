Example Answer:
The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `p[j]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0, and `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**
