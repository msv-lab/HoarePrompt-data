Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, however, the previous state of `col` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements where comps[j] is assigned the value of `col` based on the updated value of `j`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements where comps[j] is assigned the value of `col` based on the updated value of `j`**
