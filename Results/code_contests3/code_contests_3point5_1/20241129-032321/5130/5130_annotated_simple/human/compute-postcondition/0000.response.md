Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The sequences `p` and `b` are lists with lengths based on the value of `n`, where each element in `p` is between 1 and `n`, and each element in `b` is either 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequences `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length n, where each element in `p` is between 1 and n, and each element in `b` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, the sequences `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length n, where each element in `p` is between 1 and n, and each element in `b` is either 0 or 1.**
