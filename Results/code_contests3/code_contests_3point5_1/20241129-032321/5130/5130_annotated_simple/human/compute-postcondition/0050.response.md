Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements where each element is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated based on previous values of `j` and `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, `i` is incremented by 1. If comps[i] == 0, then all elements in the comps list are assigned the value of col, i is incremented by n, j is assigned the value of p[i], and the loop terminates when comps[p[j]] does not equal 0.***
