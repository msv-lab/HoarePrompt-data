The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it utilizes the variables `n`, `p`, and `b`, which have the specified constraints mentioned above. After executing the function body, the function returns nothing explicitly. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with the predefined variables `n`, `p`, and `b` according to the specified constraints without explicitly returning any value.
