Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`. The value of `j` and `col` are dependent on the previous calculations, but we know `comps` is a list of n elements where each element is assigned the value of `col`. Therefore, after this code execution, `comps[j]` will be updated to the new value of `col`. 
Output State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`**
