Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements where each element is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to a new value based on the previous value of `j` and `p` until the loop condition is no longer satisfied, and `i` must be less than n for the loop to execute one more time.***
