Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length n, `comps` is a list of n elements, for the loop to execute again there exists a valid index `j` such that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated based on the values in list `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
