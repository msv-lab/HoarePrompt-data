Example Answer: 
`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, where `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The loop will execute again only if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j] and the loop will execute again only if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0.
Output State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j] and the loop will execute again only if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0**
