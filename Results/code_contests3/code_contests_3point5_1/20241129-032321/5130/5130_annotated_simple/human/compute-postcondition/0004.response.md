Example Answer:
`col` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, the sequences `p` and `b` are lists of integers with length n where each element in `p` is between 0 and n-1, each element in `b` is either 0 or 1, a new list `comps` is created with n elements initialized to 0, and `col` is 0.
