Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements. 

The program first constructs a graph where each skewer is represented as a node and the connections between skewers are represented by the permutation `p`. It then calculates the number of unique connected components in the graph using the `comps` list.

If there is only one connected component in the graph (`col == 1`), it means that each skewer already visits each of the 2n placements in some number of seconds, so no changes are needed. Otherwise, if there are multiple connected components, the program checks if reversing any skewer is necessary by checking if `sum(b)` is non-zero. If it is, then at least one skewer needs to be reversed to ensure each skewer visits each placement.

Therefore, the program correctly determines the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed to satisfy Pavel's requirements for every potential case.
