Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the given permutation p and sequence b in order for every skewer to visit each of the 2n placements. 
The program calculates the connected components using the given permutation p and then checks if the number of connected components is equal to 1 and if the sum of the sequence b is equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it returns 0, otherwise it returns the number of connected components plus 1 if the sum of sequence b is 0.
The program handles all potential cases and correctly determines the minimum number of elements that need to be changed for the desired outcome.
