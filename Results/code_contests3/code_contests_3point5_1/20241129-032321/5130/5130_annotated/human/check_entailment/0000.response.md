Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed in the given permutation p and sequence b so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. It does so by calculating the number of components in the permutation and checking if all elements in the sequence b are zeros. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
