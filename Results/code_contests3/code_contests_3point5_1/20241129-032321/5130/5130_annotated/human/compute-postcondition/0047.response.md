Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `p[j]` determines the next value of `j`. The loop will execute again only if `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again, and `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`.
Output State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again, `j` is updated based on the value of `p[j]`**
