Example Answer:
The code creates a list `comps` of size `n` filled with 0s. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the output state will be:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces; `comps` is a list of 0s of size `n`**
