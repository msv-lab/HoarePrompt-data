Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a list comprehension that subtracts 1 from each element after converting it to an integer. The values of the elements in the list depend on the input provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1**
