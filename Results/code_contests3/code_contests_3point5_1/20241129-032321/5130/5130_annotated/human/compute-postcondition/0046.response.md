According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `comps[p[j]]`. If `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` needs to be adjusted to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0**
