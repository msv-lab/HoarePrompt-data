Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, where `p` is an array. The value of `j` is dependent on the value of `p[j]` at the current state. Therefore, the Output State is: comps[j] is assigned the value col and for the loop to execute again comps[p[j]] is equal to 0, `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j]`.
Output State: **comps[j] is assigned the value col and for the loop to execute again comps[p[j]] is equal to 0, `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j]`.**
