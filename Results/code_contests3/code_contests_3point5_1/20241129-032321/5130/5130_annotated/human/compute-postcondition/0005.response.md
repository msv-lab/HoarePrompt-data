According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `comps` is a list of 0s of size `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `comps` is a list of 0s of size `n`, `col` is 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `comps` is a list of 0s of size `n`, `col` is 0, `i` is 0**
