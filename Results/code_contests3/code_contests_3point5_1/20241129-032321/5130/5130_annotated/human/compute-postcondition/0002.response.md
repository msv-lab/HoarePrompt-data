Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by spaces to integers. The input is taken using `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input by spaces. Each element is then converted to an integer using `int`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**
