Example Answer:
`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, but the previous values of `col` and `j` are unknown. The condition `comps[p[j]]` should be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again is not met. Therefore, the Output State is: `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, the loop does not execute again as `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`, the loop does not execute again as `comps[p[j]]` is not equal to 0**
