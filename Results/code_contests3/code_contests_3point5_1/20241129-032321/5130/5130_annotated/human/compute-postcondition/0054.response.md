Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values, calculates the components based on the input data, and prints either 0 or the total number of components based on conditions. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **

Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
1. The code initializes `comps` list but does not handle the case where `n` is 0.
2. There is a potential issue with the print statement as it might not function as intended due to operator precedence.
