Example Answer:
`j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, where `p` is a list. The value of `j` is used as an index to access `p`, so `p[j]` should be 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The new value of `j` depends on the value of `p[j]` which is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: For the loop to execute the first time, comps[p[j]] needs to be 0, `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j]`.
Output State: **For the loop to execute the first time, comps[p[j]] needs to be 0, `j` is assigned a new value based on `p[j]**.
