Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `comps` is updated such that the 0th element is 1 and the 4th element is 1, `col` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is updated to a new value based on the index value of `p[j]`, `j` is less than the length of list `p`, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col`**.
