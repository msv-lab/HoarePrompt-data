Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `comps` is updated such that the 0th element is 1 and all other elements that were accessed through the loop have been updated to 1, `col` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is a value that eventually leads to a cycle based on the values of `p`, `comps[i]` is updated to `col`**
