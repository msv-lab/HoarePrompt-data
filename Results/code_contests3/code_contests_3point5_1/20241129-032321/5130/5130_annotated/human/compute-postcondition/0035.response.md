Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers where each element is input integer - 1, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `comps` is updated such that the 0th element is 1 and all other elements that were accessed through the loop have been updated to 1. `col` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is a value that eventually leads to a cycle based on the values of `p`. If `comps[i] == 0`, then the state is modified such that `comps[0]` is 0, `col` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `comps[i]` is updated to `col`, and all elements in `comps` except the 0th element are set to 1.***
