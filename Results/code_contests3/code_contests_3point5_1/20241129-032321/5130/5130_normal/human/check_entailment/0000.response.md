Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `p`, and `b`.
- It processes the input to assign group numbers to elements based on the specified conditions.
- It then calculates the total number of unique group numbers assigned and prints the result accordingly.
- The condition to print 0 if the total number of unique group numbers assigned is 1 (col == 1) or if the sum of elements in `b` is 0 is correctly implemented.
- The code handles the scenario where every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements as required by Pavel's plan.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality and confirm that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
