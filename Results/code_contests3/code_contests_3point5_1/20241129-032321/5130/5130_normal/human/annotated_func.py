#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: 
- n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- p is a sequence of integers with length n such that each element pi is an integer and 1 ≤ pi ≤ n.
- b is a sequence of zeros and ones with length n.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    p = [(int(v) - 1) for v in raw_input().split()]
    b = map(int, raw_input().split())
    comps = [(0) for i in xrange(n)]
    col = 0
    for i in xrange(n):
        if comps[i] == 0:
            col += 1
            comps[i] = col
            j = i
            while comps[p[j]] == 0:
                j = p[j]
                comps[j] = col
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: At the end of the loop, `n` is an integer within the specified range, `p` is a sequence of integers with length `n` where each value is decremented by 1, `b` is a sequence of integers with length `n` based on user input, `comps` is a list of `n` integers where each value represents the group number of the corresponding element, `col` is the total number of unique group numbers assigned, `i` is `n` after the loop finishes executing.
    print(0 if col == 1 else col) + (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `p`, and `b`, processes them to assign group numbers to elements based on specified conditions, and prints the result. If the total number of unique group numbers assigned is 1 (col == 1) or the sum of elements in `b` is 0, it prints 0, otherwise it prints the total number of unique group numbers plus 1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
