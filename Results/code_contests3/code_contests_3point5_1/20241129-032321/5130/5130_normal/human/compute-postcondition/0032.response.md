Output State: **`n` is an integer within the specified range, `i` is 1, `p` is a sequence of integers with length `n` where each value is decremented by 1, `b` is a sequence of integers with length `n` based on user input, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros with the value at index 0 updated to 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the value at index 1 in the sequence `p`, for the loop to execute again `p[j]` must be adjusted such that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, `j` is updated to the value at index 1 in the sequence `p`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is now assigned the value at index `p[j]`.**
