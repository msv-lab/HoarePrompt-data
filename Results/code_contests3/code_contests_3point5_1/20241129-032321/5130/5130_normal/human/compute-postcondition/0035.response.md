Postcondition: ***'n' is an integer within the specified range, 'i' is 1, 'p' is a sequence of integers with length 'n' where each value is decremented by 1, 'b' is a sequence of integers with length 'n' based on user input, 'comps' is a list of 'n' zeros with the value at index 0 updated to 1, 'col' is incremented by 1, 'j' is updated to the value at index 1 in the sequence 'p', 'comps[j]' is updated to 'col' for all values of 'j' in the sequence 'p', 'comps[i]' is updated to 'col', 'j' is updated to the value at index 1 in the sequence 'p' after the loop finishes executing.***
