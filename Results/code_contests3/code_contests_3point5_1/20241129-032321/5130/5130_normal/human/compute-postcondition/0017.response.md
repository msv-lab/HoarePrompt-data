Output State: **`n` is an integer within the specified range, `i` is 0, `p` is a sequence of integers with length n where each value is decremented by 1, `b` is a sequence of integers with length n based on user input, `comps` is a list of n zeros with the value at index 0 updated to 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the value at index j in the sequence p, `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, `comps[p[j]]` is updated to 1, and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0.**
