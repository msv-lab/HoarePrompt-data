Output State: **'n' is within the specified range, 'i' is 2, 'p' is a sequence of integers with length 'n' where each value is decremented by 1, 'b' is a sequence of integers with length 'n' based on user input, 'comps' is a list of 'n' zeros with the value at index 0 updated to 1, 'col' is incremented by 2, 'j' is updated to the value at index 2 in the sequence 'p', 'comps[j]' is updated to 'col' for all values of 'j' in the sequence 'p', 'comps[i]' is updated to 'col', 'j' is updated to the value at index 2 in the sequence 'p' after the loop finishes executing, 'comps[i]' is updated to 'col', 'j' is assigned the value of 'i', for the loop to execute the first time 'p[2]' is within the range of 'comps' and 'comps[p[2]]' is equal to 0, 'j' is updated to the value at index 2 in the sequence 'p', 'comps[j]' is updated to 'col', 'j' is updated to the value at index 2 in the sequence 'p'**
