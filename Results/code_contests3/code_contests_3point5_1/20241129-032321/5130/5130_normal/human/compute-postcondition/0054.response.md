Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `p`, and `b`, processes them to assign group numbers to elements based on specified conditions, and prints the result. If the total number of unique group numbers assigned is 1 (col == 1) or the sum of elements in `b` is 0, it prints 0, otherwise it prints the total number of unique group numbers plus 1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
