Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer within the specified range, `p` is a sequence of integers with length n, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones with length n.
Output State: **n is an integer within the specified range, `p` is a sequence of integers with length n, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones with length n**
