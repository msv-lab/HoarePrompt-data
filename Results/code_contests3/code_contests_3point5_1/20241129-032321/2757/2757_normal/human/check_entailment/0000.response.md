Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly identifies typos in words by checking for blocks of three or more consonants with at least two different letters.
- It inserts spaces in the word to separate the typos into different words, ensuring that each resulting word does not have any typos.
- The function `func_1` correctly checks if a character is a vowel or a consonant.
- The code handles all potential cases described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
