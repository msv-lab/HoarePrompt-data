#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: k, a, b, v are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: After the loop has executed, `res` contains the number of times the loop was executed, `a` and `b` are integers satisfying the given constraints, `k` and `v` are constants
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user as integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`. It then iterates a while loop based on the value of `a`, incrementing `res` each iteration. During each iteration, it updates the values of `a` and `b` based on certain conditions involving the constants `k` and `v`. After the loop completes, it prints the final value of `res`. The function lacks a clear explanation of the specific calculations and expected output based on the constraints provided, leaving room for potential edge cases and missing logic to be identified.
