Postcondition: ***`res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `b` is less than `k`, the value of `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, `b` is set to 0, `a` is updated based on a given formula. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is less than `k`, and `a` is decreased by `v`.***
