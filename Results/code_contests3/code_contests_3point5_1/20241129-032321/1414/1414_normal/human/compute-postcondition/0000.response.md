Example Answer:
k, a, b, and v are assigned integer values obtained by splitting the input. The values of k, a, b, and v are between 2 and 1000, and 1 and 1000 respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: k, a, b, and v are integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **k, a, b, and v are integers satisfying the given constraints**
