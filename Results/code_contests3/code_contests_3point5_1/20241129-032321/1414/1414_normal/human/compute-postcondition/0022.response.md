Postcondition: ***`res`, `a`, `b` are integers. If `b` > 0, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, and `a` remains greater than 0. If `b` <= 0, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
