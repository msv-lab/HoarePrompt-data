Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by the value of `v`. The previous values of `a` and `v` are unknown, so the output state is: `res` is increased by 1, `b` is less than `k`, `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `b` is less than `k`, `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is decreased by `v`**
