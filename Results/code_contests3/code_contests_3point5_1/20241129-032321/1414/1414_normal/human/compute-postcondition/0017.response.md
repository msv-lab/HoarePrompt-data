Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by `k * v`, where `k` and `v` are variables not defined in the initial state. The loop will execute again as long as `a` is greater than 0. The values of `res` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is increased by 1, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0**
