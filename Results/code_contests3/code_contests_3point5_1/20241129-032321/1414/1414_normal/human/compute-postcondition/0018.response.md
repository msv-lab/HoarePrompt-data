Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1` from it. The previous values of `b` and `k` are known, so the new value of `b` can be calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `b` is `b - (k - 1)`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0.**
