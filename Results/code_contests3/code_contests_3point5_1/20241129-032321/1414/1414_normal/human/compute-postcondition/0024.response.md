According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a`, `b`, `k`, `v` are integers. If `b` >= `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is `b - (k - 1)`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute again, `a` should be greater than 0. If `b` < `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, and `a` remains greater than 0.

State: **`res`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `v` are integers. If `b` >= `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is `b - (k - 1)`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0. If `b` < `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, and `a` remains greater than 0**
