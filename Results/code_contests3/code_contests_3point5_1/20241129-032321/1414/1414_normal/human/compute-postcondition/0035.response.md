The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function performs some calculations based on the constraints of the integers k, a, b, and v, where 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000. The function then returns a certain output based on these calculations. The specific calculations and output of the function are not provided in this description.
