Postcondition: ***`res`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `v` are integers. If `b` > 0, then `res`, `a`, `b`, `k`, `v` remain the same. If `b` <= 0 and `b` >= `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is `b - (k - 1)`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0. If `b` < `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `b` is 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, and `a` remains greater than 0.***
