Example Answer:
`res` is increased by 1, so after execution, `res` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is increased by 1, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0.
Output State: **`res` is increased by 1, `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute again `a` should be greater than 0**
