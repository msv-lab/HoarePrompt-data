Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`. The initial state of `b` is unknown, but it is known that `k` is between 2 and 1000, so `b` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the initial values, `b` is updated.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2, `a` is updated based on the initial values, `b` is updated**
