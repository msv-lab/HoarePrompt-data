Output State: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is the number of iterations of the loop. After the loop finishes, `a` will be a non-negative integer, `b` will be less than `k`, and both `a` and `b` will be updated based on the initial values and loop conditions.
