Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `a - v`. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `v` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the value of `a - v` can be any integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2**
