Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 1, so after execution, `res` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 2**
