Example Answer:
`res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 1**
