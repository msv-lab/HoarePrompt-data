Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 1. `b` is less than `k`. If `b` > 0, the new value of `a` is calculated based on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `v`. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, `k`, `a` are decreased by `v`, and `b` is less than `k`.***
