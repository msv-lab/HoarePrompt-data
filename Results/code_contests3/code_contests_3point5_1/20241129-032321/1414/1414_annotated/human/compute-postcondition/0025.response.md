Example Answer: 
`res` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `res` is 2, after execution, `res` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 3, for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, `v` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b, v ≤ 1000; `res` is 3, for the loop to execute again `a` is greater than 0**
