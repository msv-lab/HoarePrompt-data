Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of boxes needed to store all the nuts based on the constraints provided. The loop iterates until all nuts are stored, adjusting the values of `a` and `b` according to the conditions specified in the problem description. The final output is the minimum number of boxes required.

The program handles the cases where the number of sections in the box, the number of nuts, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section of the box are within the specified ranges. It ensures that the number of boxes used is minimized, which aligns with the problem requirements.
