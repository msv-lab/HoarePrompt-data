Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated to `a - k * v` where `a` is now greater than 0. The variables `b`, `v`, and `res` are all incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `a` is updated to a new value where `a > 0, `b`, `v`, `res` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`k`, `a` is updated to a new value where `a > 0, `b`, `v`, `res` has been incremented by 1**
