The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the result based on the following constraints:
- The parameters k, a, b, and v are integers such that 2 <= k <= 1000, and 1 <= a, b, v <= 1000.
- The function returns a calculated value based on the input parameters k, a, b, and v.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return a value based on the constraints provided for the parameters k, a, b, and v.
