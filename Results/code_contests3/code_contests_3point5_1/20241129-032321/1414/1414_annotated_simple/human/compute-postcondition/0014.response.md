Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers within specified ranges. `res` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0. If `b >= k`, then `a` is updated to the result of subtracting `k * v` from its previous value, and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `b < k`, then if `b > 0`, `a` is updated to the value of `a` minus the product of `(b + 1)` and `v`, and `b` is set to 0. If `b <= 0`, `a` is decremented by the value of `v`.***
