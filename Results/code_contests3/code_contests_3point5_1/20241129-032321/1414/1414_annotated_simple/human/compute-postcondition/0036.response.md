Functionality: The function `func` reads input integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` from the user. It then iterates a loop based on the value of `a` and updates the variables `a` and `b` according to certain conditions. The final value of `res` represents the number of successful loop iterations. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it prints the final value of `res` after the loop completes. This function lacks explicit return statements and does not cover edge cases where `a`, `b`, or `v` fall outside the specified ranges.
