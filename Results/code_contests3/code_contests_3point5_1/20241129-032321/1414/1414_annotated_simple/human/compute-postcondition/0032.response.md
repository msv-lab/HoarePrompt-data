Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers. If `b >= k`, `k`, `a` are updated to new values where `a > 0, `b` is updated by subtracting `k - 1`, `v`, `res` are incremented by 1. If `b > 0`, `b` is set to 0, `v` and `res` are incremented by 1. If `b <= 0`, `v` and `res` are still incremented by 1 but `b` remains unchanged.***
