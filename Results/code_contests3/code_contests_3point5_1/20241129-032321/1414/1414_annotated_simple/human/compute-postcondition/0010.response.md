Output State: **`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges; `res` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is greater than 0. Additionally, `b` is less than `k`. `b` is greater than 0. `a` is updated to the value of `a` minus the product of `(b + 1)` and `v`. `b` is 0.**
