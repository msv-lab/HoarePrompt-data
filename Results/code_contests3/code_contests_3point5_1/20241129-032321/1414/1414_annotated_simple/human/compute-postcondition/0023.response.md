Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers within specified ranges. If `b >= k`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` > 0 in the else part, `a` is updated according to some calculation and `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0 in the else part, `k`, `a` are updated values after subtraction, `b`, `v` are integers within specified ranges, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
