Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers within specified ranges. If `b` > 0, `a` is updated according to some calculation and `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `k`, `a` are updated values after subtraction, `b`, `v` are integers within specified ranges, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
