Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes input for k, a, b, and v.
- It then iterates through a while loop to calculate the minimum number of boxes needed to store all the nuts.
- The program correctly follows the problem description by considering the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of nuts, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section of the box.
- The program calculates the number of nuts that can be put in each section based on the divisors and the capacity of each section.
- The program terminates when all nuts have been distributed into boxes correctly.
- The logic seems correct for all possible inputs and edge cases.
