Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the number of ships (m) and then reads the jump coordinates for each ship. It then creates a list to store the count of ships that will end up at the same coordinate as each ship. The program iterates through the list of jump coordinates and counts the occurrences of each coordinate in the list. Finally, it prints the counts separated by spaces.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case as it accurately counts the number of ships that will end up at the same coordinate as each ship. There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the program does not work as expected.
