Example Answer:
`my_list` is appended with the count of the third element `i` in `test_list`. The count is added to `my_list`, and `i` is the third element in `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the total number of ships, `test_list` is a list containing at least three elements, `my_list` contains the count of the third element in `test_list`, `i` is the third element in `test_list.
Output State: **`m` is the total number of ships, `test_list` is a list containing at least three elements, `my_list` contains the count of the third element in `test_list`, `i` is the third element in `test_list**
