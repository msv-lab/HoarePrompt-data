According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is one more than the current value, `test_list` has another element added, and `e` is added to the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `m` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`m` is (current value + 2), `test_list` has another element added, `e` is added to the list**
