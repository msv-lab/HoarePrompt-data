Example Answer: 
`e` is appended to the `test_list`, resulting in the addition of the input floating-point number to the list. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer, `test_list` is a list with at least one more element added.
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` is a list with at least one more element added**
