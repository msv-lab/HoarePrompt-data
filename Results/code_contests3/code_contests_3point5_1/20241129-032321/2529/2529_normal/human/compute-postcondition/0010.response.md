Example Answer:
`e` is added to the `test_list` using the `append` method. The value of `e` is an input float, so after execution, `e` is added to the `test_list`. The value of `m` and other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is (current value + 2), `test_list` has another element added, `e` is added to the list, `e` is an input float.
Output State: **`m` is (current value + 2), `test_list` has another element added, `e` is added to the list, `e` is an input float**
