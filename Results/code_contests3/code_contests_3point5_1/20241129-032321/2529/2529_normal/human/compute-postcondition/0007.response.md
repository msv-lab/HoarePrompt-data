Example Answer: 
`e` is appended to `test_list`, which means `e` is added to the end of the list. Since `test_list` had at least one more element added before, the loop will execute another time. `m` remains (current value + 1) because it is not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is (current value + 1), `test_list` has another element added, `e` is added to the list.
Output State: **`m` is (current value + 1), `test_list` has another element added, `e` is added to the list**
