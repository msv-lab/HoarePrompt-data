The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for calculating the jump coordinates for a given number of ships (`m`). Each jump coordinate expression is of the form (a+b)/c where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits. The function will calculate and return the jump coordinates for the specified number of ships. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the jump coordinates for the specified number of ships based on the given formula (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits.**
