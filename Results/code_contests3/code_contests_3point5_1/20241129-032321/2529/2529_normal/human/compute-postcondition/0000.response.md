Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `m`, the output state will be: m is a positive integer representing the number of ships.
Output State: **m is a positive integer representing the number of ships**
