According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` should be greater than the current value of `i`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `m` should be increased by 1.
State: **`m` is (current value + 1), `test_list` is a list with at least one more element added for the loop to execute another time**
