Example Answer:
`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `m` and `test_list` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the total number of ships, `test_list` is a list containing all the float inputs entered during the loop execution, `my_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is the total number of ships, `test_list` is a list containing all the float inputs entered during the loop execution, `my_list` is an empty list**
