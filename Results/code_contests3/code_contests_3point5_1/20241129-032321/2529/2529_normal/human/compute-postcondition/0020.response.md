Example Answer:
The code prints the count of each element in `test_list` separated by spaces. The `map` function converts each count to a string, and then the `join` function joins them with a space in between. The output will be a string of counts separated by spaces. 
Output State: **`m` is the total number of ships, `test_list` is a list containing all the float inputs entered during the loop execution, `my_list` contains the count of each element in `test_list`, `i` is the last element in `test_list`, and the counts of each element in `test_list` are printed separated by spaces.**
