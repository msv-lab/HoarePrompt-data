According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, m is a positive integer does ensure that the loop will execute, so no adjustment is needed for `m`. However, since `test_list` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time, `test_list` must have at least one element added to it. Therefore, the adjustment needed is: `test_list` is a list with at least one element added.
State: **`m` is a positive integer, `test_list` is a list with at least one element added**
