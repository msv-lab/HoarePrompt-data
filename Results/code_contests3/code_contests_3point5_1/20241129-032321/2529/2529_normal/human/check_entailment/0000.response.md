Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description specifies that the input coordinates are given in the form of an arithmetic expression, such as (a+b)/c. However, the code is trying to read float numbers directly instead of arithmetic expressions. Therefore, the code does not handle the input format correctly and will not produce the desired output.
