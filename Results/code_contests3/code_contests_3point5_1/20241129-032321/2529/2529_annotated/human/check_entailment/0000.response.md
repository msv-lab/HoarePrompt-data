Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The main issue lies in the fact that the program is reading the input as floating-point numbers (`float(input())`) while the problem description clearly states that the input will be in the form of arithmetic expressions `(a+b)/c`. This means that the program is not correctly parsing the input data and will not be able to extract the required information to determine the number of ships ending up at the same coordinate.

Additionally, the program is counting occurrences of floating-point numbers, which is not what the problem description asks for. It should be counting the occurrences of jump coordinates in the form of `(a+b)/c`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description.
