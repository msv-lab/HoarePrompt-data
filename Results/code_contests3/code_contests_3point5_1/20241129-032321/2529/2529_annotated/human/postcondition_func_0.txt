The function reads an integer m as input representing the number of ships. Each ship's jump coordinate, given in the form (a+b)/c, is then read as a floating-point number and added to a list test_list. Subsequently, the function counts the occurrences of each element in test_list and stores these counts in my_list. Finally, the function prints the counts as a string. The function essentially processes and displays the frequency of occurrence of jump coordinates for the given ships.
