Example Answer:
A new element `e` is appended to the `test_list`. The value of `e` is taken as an input floating-point number. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `e` is the input floating-point number, `test_list` contains the new element `e`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `e` is the input floating-point number, `test_list` contains the new element `e`**
