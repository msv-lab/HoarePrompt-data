Example Answer:
`e` is appended to `test_list`. The value of `e` is provided as an input float. Since `test_list` was initially empty, it now contains the value of `e`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the input float `e`.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `test_list` contains the input float `e`**
