Example Answer:
The count of occurrences of `i` (which is `m-1`) in `test_list` is calculated using the `count` method and appended to `my_list`. Since `i` is `m-1`, the count would be the number of times `m-1` occurs in `test_list`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `e` is the input floating-point number, test_list contains more than `m` elements of input floats, my_list is a list containing the count of occurrences of `m-1` in test_list**
