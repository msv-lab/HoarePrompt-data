According to the code, the loop can execute if the test_list has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, m is greater than 0 ensures that the loop can execute. Additionally, since i is equal to m-1, the loop can start with the last element of the test_list. Hence, for the loop to execute the first time, the test_list must have at least 1 element, and i is the index of the last element in the list.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `e` is the input floating-point number, test_list contains `m` elements of input floats, my_list is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time test_list has at least 1 element, i is the index of the last element in the list**
