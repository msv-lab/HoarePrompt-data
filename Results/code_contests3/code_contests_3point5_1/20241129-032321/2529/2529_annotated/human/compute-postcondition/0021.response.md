The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for validating the jump coordinates of ships. The function will process the jump coordinates of each ship and return whether the coordinates are in the correct format or not based on the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function validates the jump coordinates of ships, ensuring they are in the correct arithmetic expression format (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers of up to two decimal digits.**
