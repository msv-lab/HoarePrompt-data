According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. Since i is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be 1 and m must still be greater than 1.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than 1**
