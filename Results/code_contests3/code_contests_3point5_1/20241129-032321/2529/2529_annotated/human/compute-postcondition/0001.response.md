Example Answer:
The list `test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` representing the number of ships is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the number of ships; `test_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`m` is the number of ships; `test_list` is an empty list**
