Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is expecting float inputs, but the problem description states that the input will be in the form of arithmetic expressions. Additionally, the program is not parsing the arithmetic expressions correctly to calculate the coordinates as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Example where the program does not work correctly:
Input
```
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7
```

Expected Output
```
1 2 2 1
```
