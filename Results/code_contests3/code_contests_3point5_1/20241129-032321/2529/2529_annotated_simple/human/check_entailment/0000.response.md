Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description states that the input will be in the form of arithmetic expressions like (a+b)/c, but the program is reading float values instead of arithmetic expressions. Therefore, the program does not calculate the correct number of ships ending up at the same coordinate.
