According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `test_list` is an empty list, it does not have any impact on the loop execution. Before the loop starts, `m` is an input integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `m` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
