Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `m` from the user, then reads `m` floating-point numbers into a list `test_list`. It then iterates over each element in `test_list`, counts the occurrences of each element, and stores the counts in a new list `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each unique float in `test_list` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
