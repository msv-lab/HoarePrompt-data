According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the list has at least 1 float, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the last float in the `test_list`. So for the loop to be executed, the `test_list` must have at least 1 float, `i` should be initialized to the first float in the list, and `my_list` should be updated with the floats in `test_list`.

State: **`m` is greater than 0, `test_list` contains floats with at least 1 float, `i` is the first float in `test_list`, `e` is the input float for the last iteration, `my_list` is a list containing the floats in `test_list`**
