Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so we can't calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with final updated values based on the loop conditions, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`.
