Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `MOD`, `a`, and `j` are known from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with all elements set to 1, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. The element at index (i-1, j) in a is equal to 1 and the jth bit in mask is also set to 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with all elements set to 1, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.
