Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000000007, `a` contains integer values, `dp` contains the final updated values, `i` remains 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is increased by n+1, `j` is equal to n, all values in `a[i-1]` and `a[j]` are 1. The `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][0]` for each iteration of the loop and further increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `^` denotes bitwise XOR and `<<` denotes left shift, only if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set. After all calculations, `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set.**
