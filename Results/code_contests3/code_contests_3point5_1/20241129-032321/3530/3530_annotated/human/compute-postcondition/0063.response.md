Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, i is 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, all values of j from 0 to n-1 have been iterated over, the value of mask is less than 1 << n, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j.**
