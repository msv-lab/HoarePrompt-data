Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute a second time, j is 1 and remains less than n. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, the program will update certain values based on these conditions.***
