According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the value of `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is 1 << n, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time `mask` is 1, `j` is 1.**
