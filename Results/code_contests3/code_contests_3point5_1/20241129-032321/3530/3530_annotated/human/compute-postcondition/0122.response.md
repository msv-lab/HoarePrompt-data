Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with final updated values based on the loop conditions, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is equal to `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, the loop executes one more time with updated values of `dp`.***
