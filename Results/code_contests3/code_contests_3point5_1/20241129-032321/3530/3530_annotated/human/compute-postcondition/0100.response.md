Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the conditions inside the loop, `i` is updated to reflect the number of iterations of the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n`. The element at index `i-1` and `j` in list `a` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation of `mask` and 1 left shifted by `j` is non-zero.**
