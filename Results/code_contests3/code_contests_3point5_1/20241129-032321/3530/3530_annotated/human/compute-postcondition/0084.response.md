Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is updated, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is less than `n-1`. The element at index `i-1` and `j` in list `a` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
