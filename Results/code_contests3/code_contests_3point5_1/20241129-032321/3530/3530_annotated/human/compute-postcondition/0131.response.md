Output State: **MOD remains 1000000007, `a` remains a list containing integer values, `dp` contains the final updated values, `i` remains 0, `n` is still a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is increased by 1, `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute another time. The value at index `i-1` and `j` in list `a` is 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
