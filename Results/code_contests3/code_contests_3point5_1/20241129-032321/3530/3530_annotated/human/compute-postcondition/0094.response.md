Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is updated, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is increased by 1 and still less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND operation with 1 left shifted by `j` yields a non-zero result, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does not enter the else part.***
