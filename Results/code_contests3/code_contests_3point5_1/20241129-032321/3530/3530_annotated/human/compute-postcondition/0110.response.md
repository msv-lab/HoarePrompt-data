Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` reflects the number of iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n`, and the conditions `a[i][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` hold true for updating `dp[i][mask] with the updated value after the if statement executes**
