Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time j is 0, the value of `mask` is within the range 1 to 1 << n, a[i - 1][j] == 1, and mask & 1 << j are satisfied, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then updated to dp[i][mask] modulo MOD**
