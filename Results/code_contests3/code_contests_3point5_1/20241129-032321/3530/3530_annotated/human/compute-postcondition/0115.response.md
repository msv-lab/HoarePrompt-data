Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with final updated values based on the loop conditions, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. The element at index (i-1, j) in `a` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` results in a non-zero value.***
