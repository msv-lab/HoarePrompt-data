Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are updated, and `n` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is updated, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is increased by 1 and still less than `n`.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is updated, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is increased by 1 and still less than `n`**
