Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are known, so the calculation can be performed to update the value of `dp[i][mask]`.  
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, j is increased by 1 and remains less than n.**
