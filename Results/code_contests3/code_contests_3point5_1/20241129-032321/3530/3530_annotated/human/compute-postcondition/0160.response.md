Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, MOD remains 1000000007, `a` still contains integer values, `dp` holds the final updated values based on the loop conditions, `i` is 1 << n, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is equal to (1 << n) - 1, `j` is equal to n - 1, and the value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed.**
