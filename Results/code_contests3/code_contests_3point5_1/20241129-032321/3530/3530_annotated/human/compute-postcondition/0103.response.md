Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n+1`, and `i` reflects the number of iterations. The Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` reflects the number of iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n+1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated according to the provided formula.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` reflects the number of iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n+1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated according to the provided formula**
