Example Answer: 
`map(int, raw_input().split())` converts the input to a list of integers. Since `_` is incremented by 2 and `a` appends the list of integers obtained from the input split for the next iteration, the final state after execution is `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is incremented by 2, `a` appends the list of integers obtained from the input split for the next iteration.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `_` is incremented by 2, `a` appends the list of integers obtained from the input split for the next iteration**
