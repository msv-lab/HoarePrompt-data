Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, i is 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, all values of j from 0 to n-1 have been iterated over, the value of mask needs to be less than 1 << n, j is n+2, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1, the (j+2)-th bit of mask is set to 1, dp[i][mask] is updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j], dp[i][mask] is taken modulo MOD. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated as dp[i][mask] %= MOD**
