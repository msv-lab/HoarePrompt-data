Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with final updated values based on the loop conditions, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, the element at index (i-1, j) in `a` is 1, and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` results in a non-zero value. After execution of the code, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` after the modulo operation with MOD.**
