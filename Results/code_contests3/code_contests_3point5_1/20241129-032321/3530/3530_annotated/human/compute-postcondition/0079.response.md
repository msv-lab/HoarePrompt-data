Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is updated, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the second time `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and the modified values of `a`, `dp`, and `i` based on the loop body conditions. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the j-th bit set, the program executes the if block. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
