Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` with modulus `MOD`. The value of `mask ^ 1 << j` is calculated based on the conditions `a[i][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`. The values of `MOD`, `a`, `i`, `n`, `mask`, `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` reflects the number of iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n+1` and the conditions `a[i][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` hold true for updating `dp[i][mask] with the updated value.**
