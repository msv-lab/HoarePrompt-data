Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values, dp is a 2D list, i is 1 << n, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, mask is 1, j is 0. The value at index (i-1, j) in list a is 1 and the jth bit of mask is also 1. dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and then taking the modulo by MOD.**
