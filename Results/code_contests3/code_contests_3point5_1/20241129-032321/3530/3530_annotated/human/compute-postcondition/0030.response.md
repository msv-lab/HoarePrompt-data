Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The values of i, n, and j are known, but the values of mask and dp are not provided, so the final values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute a second time, j is 1 and remains less than n.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute a second time, j is 1 and remains less than n**
