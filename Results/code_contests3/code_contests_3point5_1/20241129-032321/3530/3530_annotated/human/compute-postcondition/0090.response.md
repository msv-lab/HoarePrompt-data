Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` is updated, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, and `j` is less than `n`. If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] is updated based on the provided formula.***
