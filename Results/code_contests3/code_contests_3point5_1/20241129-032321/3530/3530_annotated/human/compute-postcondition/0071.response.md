Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list, `i` is 1 << n, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, then dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] modulo MOD.***
