Postcondition: ***MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing integer values, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, `i` reflects the number of iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is less than `n+1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with MOD.***
