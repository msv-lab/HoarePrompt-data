Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1. The loop will have executed for all values of j from 0 to n-1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then dp[i][mask] will be updated accordingly and its value will be the remainder when divided by MOD.**
