Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and performing modulo operation with MOD. The values of MOD, i, n, and j are provided in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, j is increased by 1 and remains less than n.
Output State: **MOD is 1000000007, a is a list containing integer values from input splits, dp is a 2D list with updated values, i is equal to 1 << n - 1, n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, j is increased by 1 and remains less than n**
