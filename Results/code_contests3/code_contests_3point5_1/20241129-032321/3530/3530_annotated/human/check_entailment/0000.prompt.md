You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: MOD is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing the integer values obtained from all the input splits
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `MOD` is 1000000007, `a` is a list containing the integer values obtained from all the input splits, `dp` is a 2D list with all elements set to 1, `i` is equal to `1 << n - 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer to determine the number of iterations
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, MOD remains 1000000007, `a` still contains integer values, `dp` holds the final updated values based on the loop conditions, `i` is 1 << n, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is equal to (1 << n) - 1, and `j` is equal to n - 1. The loop has iterated over all possible combinations of `mask` and `j`, updating `dp[i][mask]` based on the conditions specified in the loop code.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` initializes MOD as 1000000007, reads an integer `n` from input, and populates a list `a` with integer values obtained from subsequent input splits. It then creates a 2D list `dp` and performs nested loops to update its values based on certain conditions. Finally, the function prints a specific output based on the updated `dp` values. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
