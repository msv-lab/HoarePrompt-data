The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the user as input, then reads an `n x n` matrix `a` consisting of elements that are either 0 or 1. It calculates and updates a dynamic programming array `dp` based on the provided formula and constraints. Finally, it prints the value at a specific index of `dp` without returning a value.
