According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. Since the loop should execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the initial state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n`.
State: **Initial values of `N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` will remain the same as their initial values before the loop started. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is less than `n`.**
