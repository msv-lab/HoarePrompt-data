Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The initial values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `n`, and `j` are given. Since `i` is 3, `mask` remains the same, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` is 1, we can calculate the new value of `dp[i][mask]`. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
