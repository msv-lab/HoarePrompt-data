According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times where `n` is the value assigned to `n` in the loop statement. Since the loop will execute `n` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
