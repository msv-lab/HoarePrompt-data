Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with respect to `MOD` based on the calculation involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
