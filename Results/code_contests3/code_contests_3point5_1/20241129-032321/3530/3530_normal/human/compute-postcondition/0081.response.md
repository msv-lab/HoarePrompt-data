According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask` and `n`. If `mask` is less than `1 << n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same except for `dp[i][mask]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for dp[i][mask] which is updated following the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] taking the modulo with the value of MOD for the next value of mask, if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j for all valid values of i, mask, and j.**
