Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
