Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking the modulo `MOD`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking the modulo `MOD`**
