Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its previous value. The initial state provides information about the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and the set bit in `mask`. However, the exact values are not specified. Therefore, after running the code, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its previous value.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus of its previous value**
