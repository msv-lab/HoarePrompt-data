Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The value of `mask` is updated to the next value in the range `(1 << n)`. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous values and operations performed.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous values and operations performed**
