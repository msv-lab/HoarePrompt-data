Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains the same with `i` being 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0. `mask` has gone through all the possible values in the range (1 << n) after the loop has executed all iterations. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, with the modulo operation applied each time.**
