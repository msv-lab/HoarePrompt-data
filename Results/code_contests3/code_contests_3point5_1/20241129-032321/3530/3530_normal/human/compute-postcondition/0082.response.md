According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all variables remain the same except for `dp[i][mask]`, which needs to be updated as described. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is greater than 0 and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated following the given formula.
State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated as described, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
