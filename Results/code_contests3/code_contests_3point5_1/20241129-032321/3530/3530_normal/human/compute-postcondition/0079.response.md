Postcondition: ***All variables remain the same, except for `i` being increased by 1, `mask` and `j` need to satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, then the program continues to the next iteration with updated `i`, `mask`, and `j`. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.***
