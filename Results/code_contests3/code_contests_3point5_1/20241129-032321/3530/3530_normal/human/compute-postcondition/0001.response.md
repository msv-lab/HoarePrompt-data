Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, and `n` is the user input.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the user input**
