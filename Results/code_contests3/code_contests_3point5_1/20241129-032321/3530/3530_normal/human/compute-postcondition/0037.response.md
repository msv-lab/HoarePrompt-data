Example Answer:
The value at index dp[i][mask] is incremented by the value at index dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The previous values of i, mask, and j are known. After the execution, the values in the dp list are updated accordingly based on the provided formula.
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, N is a positive integer, a_{i, j} is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, n is the user input and greater than 0, a contains the integers obtained from the user input split by space, _ is equal to n-1, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the value at index 0 of each subarray is initialized to 1 for all i in range(1 << n), for the loop to execute one more time mask should be incremented by 1, j is now incremented by 1. In addition, a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask & 1 << j. The values in the dp list are updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j].**
