Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. The value of `j` is increased by 1. The states of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`, and `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`, and `j` is increased by 1**
