According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `i` from 0 to (1 << n) - 1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop used to execute up to (1 << n) - 1. To execute one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a_{i, j}` is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, MOD is 1000000007, `n` is the user input and greater than 0, `a` contains the integers obtained from the user input split by space, `_` is equal to n-1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the value at index 0 of each subarray is initialized to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be less than (1 << n) - 1**
