Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by taking the modulo with the value of MOD. This ensures that the value remains within a certain range. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for dp[i][mask] which is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] taking the modulo with the value of MOD.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for dp[i][mask] which is updated based on the calculation dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] taking the modulo with the value of MOD.**
