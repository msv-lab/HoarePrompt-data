Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with the value of `MOD`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, so the specific result of the modulo operation cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with the value of `MOD`.
Output State: **The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with the value of `MOD`**
