According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `mask`, `i`, `n`, and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` remains the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. Since the loop iterates over `mask`, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be updated.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` ranges from 0 to n-1, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` should be updated to the next value in the range (1 << n)**.
