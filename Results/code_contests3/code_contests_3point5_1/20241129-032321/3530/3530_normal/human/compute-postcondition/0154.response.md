Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The loop is assumed to be executing the third time, which means `n` is greater than 0. Also, `a[i - 1][j]` is assumed to be equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` condition is satisfied. The previous values of variables are not explicitly provided, so the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the mentioned calculation.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the mentioned calculation**
