Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N` is a positive integer, `a_{i, j}` is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the user input and greater than 0, `a` contains the integers obtained from the user input split by space, `_` is equal to n-1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the value at index 0 of each subarray is initialized to 1 for all i in range(1 << n), and the values in `dp` are updated based on the conditions in the loop code.**
