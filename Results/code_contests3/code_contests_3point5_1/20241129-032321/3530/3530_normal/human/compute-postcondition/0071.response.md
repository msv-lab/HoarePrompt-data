Postcondition: ***`N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` remain the same as their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is less than `n` and `j` is now `j + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with the value of `MOD`.***
