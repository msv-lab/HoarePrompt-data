Example Answer: 
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. The other variables remain the same as their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`**
