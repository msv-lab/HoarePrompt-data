Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` is 3, so `i - 1` is 2. The value of `mask` remains the same. The value of `j` is 2, so `1 << j` is 4. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` results in a new mask value. Depending on the specific values in the arrays `dp`, the final value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
