Postcondition: ***After the if condition, all variables `N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` remain the same as their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` is greater than 0 and `mask` is incremented to the next value within the range of `1` to `1 << n`. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set to 1.***
