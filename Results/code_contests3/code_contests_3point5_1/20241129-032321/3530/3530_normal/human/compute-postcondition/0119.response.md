According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` is the same, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the same, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 1**
