According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `mask` is within the range `1` to `1 << n`. Since `i` is 2 at the start, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `i` is 3.
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the same, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than or equal to `n`**
