Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The value of `j` is increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]`, `mask`, and `j` which have been updated.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`, and `j` is increased by 1**
