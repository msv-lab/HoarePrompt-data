Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and calculating the modulo with `MOD`. Since the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are unknown, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
