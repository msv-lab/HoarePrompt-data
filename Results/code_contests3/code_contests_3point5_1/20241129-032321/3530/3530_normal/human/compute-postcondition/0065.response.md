According to the code, the loop can execute for the next iteration if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is one less than `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **After the loop finishes executing, the values of all variables `N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` will remain the same as their initial values before the loop started. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n`.**
