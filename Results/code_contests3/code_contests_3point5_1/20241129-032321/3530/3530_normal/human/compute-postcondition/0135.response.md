Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain the same. The loop executes for `j` ranging from 0 to n-1, updating `mask` to the next value in the range (1 << n). After execution, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the previous values. 
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `mask`**
