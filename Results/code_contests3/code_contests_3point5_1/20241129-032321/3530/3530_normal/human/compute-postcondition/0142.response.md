Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains the same with `i` being 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range (1 << n) after each iteration of the loop. The values of `dp[i][mask]` are updated based on the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, with the updated value being taken modulo `MOD`**
