Postcondition: ***All variables `N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` retain their initial values. After the if-else block executes, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. To execute the loop one more time, `n` remains greater than 0 and `mask` is incremented to the next value within the range of `1` to `1 << n`.***
