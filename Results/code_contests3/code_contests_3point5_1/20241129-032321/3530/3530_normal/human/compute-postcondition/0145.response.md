Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` remains the same with `i` being 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is the initial value of the range (1 << n) when j is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1***
