Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `mask` is the initial value of the range (1 << n) when `j` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` is greater than 0 and specific conditions related to `a` and `mask` are met. The specific values of `i`, `n`, and `mask` are not provided, so the final output state will be that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
