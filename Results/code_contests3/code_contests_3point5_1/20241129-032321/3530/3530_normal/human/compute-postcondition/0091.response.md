According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, `j` is `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n+1`**
