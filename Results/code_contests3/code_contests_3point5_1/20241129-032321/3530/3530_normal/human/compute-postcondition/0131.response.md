Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The value of `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `j` ranges from 0 to n-1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j`-th bit of `mask` is set. After execution, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned in the code snippet.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned in the code snippet**
