Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are unknown, so the output state is: Updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`.
Output State: **Updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`**
