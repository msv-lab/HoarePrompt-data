Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `j` is `n`, so the loop will execute one more time. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, `j` is `n+1`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated by taking its modulo with `MOD`, `j` is `n+1`**
