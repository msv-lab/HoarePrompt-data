Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, all variables `N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, `mask`, and `j` will retain their initial values. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 and `mask` should be incremented to the next value within the range of `1` to `1 << n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the modulus with MOD.***
