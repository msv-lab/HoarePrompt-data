Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` remains the same with `i` being 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0. `mask` is the initial value of the range (1 << n) when j is 0. For the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0 and specific conditions related to `a` and `mask` are met. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation with MOD.***
