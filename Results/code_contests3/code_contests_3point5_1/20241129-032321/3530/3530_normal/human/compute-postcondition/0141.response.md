Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` remains the same with `i` equal to 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0. `j` is updated to the next value, `mask` is also updated to the next value in the range (1 << n). If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.***
