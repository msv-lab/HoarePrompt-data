Example Answer:
`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and calculating the modulus with MOD. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except `dp[i][mask]` which is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulus with MOD.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except `dp[i][mask]` which is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulus with MOD.**
