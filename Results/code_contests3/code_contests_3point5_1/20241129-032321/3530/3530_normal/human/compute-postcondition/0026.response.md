Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `a_{i, j}` is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the user input and greater than 0, `a` contains the integers obtained from the user input split by space, `_` is equal to n-1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the value at index 0 of each subarray is initialized to 1 for all i in range(1 << n), for the loop to execute the second time `mask` should be updated, `j` should be 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` should be equal to 1 and the `(j+1)-th` bit of `mask` should be set to 1. After executing the given code snippet, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
