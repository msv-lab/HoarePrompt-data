Output State: All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated. `mask` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1. `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `mask` has the jth bit set to 1. The formula `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is applied, updating the value of `dp[i][mask]` based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.**
