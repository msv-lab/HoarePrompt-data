Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with respect to `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` and other variables are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with respect to `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with respect to `MOD`**
