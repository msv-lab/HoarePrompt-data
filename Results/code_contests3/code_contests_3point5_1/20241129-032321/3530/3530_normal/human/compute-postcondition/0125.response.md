Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of the current value. The calculation involves `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided, so the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
