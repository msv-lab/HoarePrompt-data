According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`, `mask` and `j` remain the same as their initial values, and `j` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`, `mask` and `j` remain the same as their initial values. Additionally, `j` is increased by 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n`**
