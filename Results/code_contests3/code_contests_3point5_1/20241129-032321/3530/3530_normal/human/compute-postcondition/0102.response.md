According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]`, `mask`, and `j` which have been updated. After the execution of the if else block, the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` is the remainder when divided by `MOD`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
