According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` is the same does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, for the loop to execute, `j` must be 0. 
State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the same, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is 0**
