Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. 
Output State: **All variables remain the same as their initial values, except for `dp[i][mask]` which has been updated. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`**
