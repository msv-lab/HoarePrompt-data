According to the given code snippet, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be less than `n` and `j` should be incremented by 1. Additionally, if `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the value of `dp[i][mask]` should be updated by taking the modulo with the value of `MOD`.

State: **`N`, `a_{i, j}`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `dp`, and `mask` remain the same as their initial values. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and if `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with the value of `MOD`.**
