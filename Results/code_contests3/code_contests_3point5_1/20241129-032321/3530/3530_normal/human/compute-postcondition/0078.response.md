Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of its current value divided by `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, except for `i` being increased by 1, `mask` and `j` need to satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, except for `i` being increased by 1, `mask` and `j` need to satisfy the loop condition for the next iteration**
