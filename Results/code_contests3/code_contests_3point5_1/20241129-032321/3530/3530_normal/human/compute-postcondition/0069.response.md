Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain the same. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, the calculation proceeds. The new value of `dp[i][mask]` is determined by the previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`. 
Output State: **The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`**
