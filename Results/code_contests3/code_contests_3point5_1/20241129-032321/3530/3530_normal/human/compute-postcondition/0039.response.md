Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, `N` remains a positive integer, `a_{i, j}` is either 0 or 1 for all i, j where 1 <= i, j <= N, `MOD` remains 1000000007, `n` stays as the user input and greater than 0, `a` still contains the integers obtained from the user input split by space, `_` remains equal to n-1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (1 << n) where the value at index 0 of each subarray is initialized to 1 for all i in range(1 << n), for the loop to execute one more time `mask` will be incremented by 1, `j` is now incremented by 1. Additionally, the values in the dp list will be updated based on the formula dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j] and each value in dp[i][mask] will be taken modulo MOD.***
