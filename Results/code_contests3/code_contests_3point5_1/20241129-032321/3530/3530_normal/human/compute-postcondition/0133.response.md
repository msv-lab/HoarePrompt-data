Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` remains the same, with `i` being 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0. `j` ranges from 0 to n-1 for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` is updated to the next value in the range (1 << n). If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.***
