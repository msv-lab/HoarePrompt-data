According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `j`, `mask`, and the condition `a[i - 1][j] == 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` remains the same, with `i` equal to 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should range from 0 to n-1, and `mask` should be updated to the next value in the range (1 << n).

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `j` should be incremented by 1.
- If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set, then `dp[i][mask]` should be updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains the same, with `i` equal to 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0. `j` is updated to the next value, `mask` is also updated to the next value in the range (1 << n).**
