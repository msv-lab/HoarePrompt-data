Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` remains the same with `i` being 3 and `n` greater than or equal to 0, `mask` is the initial value of the range (1 << n) when j is 0. For the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo operation.***
