Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
