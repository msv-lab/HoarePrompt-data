Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, where `j` is increased by 2. The values of `mask` and `j` remain the same as their initial values. After executing this code, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`, and `j` will be increased by 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`, `mask` and `j` remain the same as their initial values, `j` is increased by 2.
Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`, `mask` and `j` remain the same as their initial values, `j` is increased by 2**
