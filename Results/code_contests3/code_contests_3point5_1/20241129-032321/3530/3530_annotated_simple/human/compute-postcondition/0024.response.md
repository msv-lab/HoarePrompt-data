Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with values updated according to the provided formula, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1. If a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and the jth bit of mask is set, then the program updates the values of dp according to the specified conditions.***
