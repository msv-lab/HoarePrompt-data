According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value, i.e., `i + 1`.
State: **All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask`, `i` is i + 1, `j` is as described in the initial state for the next iteration**
