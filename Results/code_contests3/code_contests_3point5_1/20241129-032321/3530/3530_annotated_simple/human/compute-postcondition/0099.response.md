Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is 0. This operation is performed modulo `MOD`. All the initial conditions are met, so the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list containing updated values based on the provided formula, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n) + 1, all elements at index `i - 1` of list `a` are equal to 1, for all `j`, `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1, and all `dp[i][mask]` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values based on the provided formula, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n) + 1, all elements at index `i - 1` of list `a` are equal to 1, for all `j`, `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1, and all `dp[i][mask]` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1.**
