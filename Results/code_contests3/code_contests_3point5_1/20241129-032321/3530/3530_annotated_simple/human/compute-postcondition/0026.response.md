Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is the value represented by the right shift operation. The previous values of variables are known, so we can calculate the result based on those values.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the provided formula, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1**
