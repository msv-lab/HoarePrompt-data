Output State: `dp` 2D list will contain updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `jth` bit set to 1. `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
