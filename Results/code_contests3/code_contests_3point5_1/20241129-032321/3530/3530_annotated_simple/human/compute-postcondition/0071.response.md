Postcondition: ***`dp` 2D list will contain updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `jth` bit set to 1, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`.***
