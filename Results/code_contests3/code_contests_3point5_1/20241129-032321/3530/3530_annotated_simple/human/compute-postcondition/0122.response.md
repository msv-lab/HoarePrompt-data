Postcondition: ***All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`. `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`. `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the program continues with the updated values.***
