Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged as the program variables stay in the same state. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than `n`, `a[i][j]` must be equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j` must be true. Moreover, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true.
