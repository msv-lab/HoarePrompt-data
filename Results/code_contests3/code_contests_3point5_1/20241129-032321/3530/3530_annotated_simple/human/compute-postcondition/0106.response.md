According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements at index `i` of list `dp` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`. For the next iteration, `j` will be increased by 1 so `j` will be incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
State: **All elements at index `i` of list `dp` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`, `j` is incremented, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
