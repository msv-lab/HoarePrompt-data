Output State: All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated with the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, `a[i][j]` should be equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j` should be true.
