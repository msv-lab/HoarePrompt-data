Example Answer: 
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the updated value at `dp[i][mask]` is the remainder of the current value at `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `mask` remain unchanged, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1, `j` is incremented by 1, value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated as described above**
