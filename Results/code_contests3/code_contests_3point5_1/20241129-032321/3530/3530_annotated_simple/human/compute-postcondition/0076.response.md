According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop for the second time, `j` needs to be further incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n+1`.
State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than 0**
