Example Answer:
The code snippet takes the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with the value of `MOD`. Consequently, the value at index `i` of `mask` is updated based on the modulo operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to n, `mask` is incremented by 1 and still less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute one more time. The element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1.
