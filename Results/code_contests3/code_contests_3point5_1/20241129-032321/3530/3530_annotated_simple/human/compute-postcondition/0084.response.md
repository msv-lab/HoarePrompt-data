Example Answer:
The value of dp[i][mask] is updated by adding the value of dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `MOD`, and the elements of `dp` remain the same. The `mask` is incremented by 1 and is still less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute one more time. The element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1. 
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to n, `mask` is incremented by 1 and still less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute one more time. The element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1**
