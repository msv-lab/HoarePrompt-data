According to the code, the loop can execute `1 << n` times based on the variable `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all values in the first row set to 1. Since the loop iterates through `1 << n` values, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
