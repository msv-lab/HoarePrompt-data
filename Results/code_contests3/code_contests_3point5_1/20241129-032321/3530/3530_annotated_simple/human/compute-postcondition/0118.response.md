Postcondition: ***All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is as described in the initial state for the next iteration. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then the program continues with the updated values.***
