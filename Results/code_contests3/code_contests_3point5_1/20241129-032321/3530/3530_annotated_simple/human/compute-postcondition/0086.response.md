Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to n, `mask` is incremented by 1 and still less than (1 << n) for the loop to execute one more time. The element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1 after the execution of the if else block.***
