According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variable `_` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time**
