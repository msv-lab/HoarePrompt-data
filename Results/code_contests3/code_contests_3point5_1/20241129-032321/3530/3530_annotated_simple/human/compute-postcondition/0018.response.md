According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted so that the loop can execute properly. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all values in the first row set to 1 and all other values set to 0, for the loop to execute `i` is 1**
