Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `n`, `a`, `_`, and `mask` remain within the range `1` to `1 << n`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, and `j` should be less than `n` for the loop to continue. 
Output State: **All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n`**
