Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to n+1, `mask` is incremented by 1 and still less than (1 << n), element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated, and `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
