According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `dp` 2D list will contain updated values based on the provided formula. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1**
