Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the provided formula, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1. If a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j, the program continues based on the condition provided.***
