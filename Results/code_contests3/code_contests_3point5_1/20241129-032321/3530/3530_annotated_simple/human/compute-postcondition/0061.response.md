Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `mask` with `j`th bit set to 1, element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated.
Output State: **`dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `j` is incremented by 1, `mask` with `j`th bit set to 1, element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated**
