Postcondition: ***`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the provided formula, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then a specific condition is met.***
