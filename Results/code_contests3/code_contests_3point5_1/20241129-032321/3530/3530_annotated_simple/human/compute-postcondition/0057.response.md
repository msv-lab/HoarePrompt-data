Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is known, and it will be updated accordingly. The value of `mask` is incremented by 1, and the `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1. The element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `mask` is incremented by 1, `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.
Output State: **`dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `mask` is incremented by 1, `j`th bit of `mask` is set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**
