Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the elements of `dp` are not provided, so the exact calculation cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the provided formula, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values according to the provided formula, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`**
