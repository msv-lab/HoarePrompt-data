Example Answer:
`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1 for all columns `i` in the 2D list `dp`. The initial state provides that `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is calculated as (1 << n) - 1, and `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (n + 1) rows and (1 << n) columns. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all values in the first row set to 1.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains mapped integers from input, `_` is (1 << n) - 1, `dp` is a 2D list with all values in the first row set to 1**
