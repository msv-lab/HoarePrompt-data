According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, `_`, and `mask`. If `j` is less than `n` and the conditions `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` are met, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `n`.

State: **All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` has been incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, `a[i][j]` should be equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j` should be true.**
