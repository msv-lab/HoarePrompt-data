State: **All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `n-1`, for the loop to execute `j` must be less than `n`, `a[i][j]` must be equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j` must be true. Moreover, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is `n-1`, `a[i][n-1]` is equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << (n-1)` is true**
