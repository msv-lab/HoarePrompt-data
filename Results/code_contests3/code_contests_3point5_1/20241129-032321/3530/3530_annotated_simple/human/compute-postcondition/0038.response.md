Example Answer:
After executing the code snippet, the value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of the current value at `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. The value at `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the 1 bit shifted by `j` position, and the value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of the current value at `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`.
