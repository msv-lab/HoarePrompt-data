According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `a`, and `mask`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the specified range, `i` is incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `j` should be updated to the next value within the range of `n`.

State: **All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `n`**
