Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking modulo `MOD`. The loop variable `j` is incremented. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `n`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `j` are unknown, so the output state is: All elements at index `i` of list `dp` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`, `j` is incremented.
Output State: **All elements at index `i` of list `dp` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`, `j` is incremented**
