Example Answer: 
The `print` statement outputs the value stored in `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The values of `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD, n, a, _, i, and mask remain unchanged and the value stored in dp[n][(1 << n) - 1] is printed.
Output State: **MOD, n, a, _, i, and mask remain unchanged and the value stored in dp[n][(1 << n) - 1] is printed**
