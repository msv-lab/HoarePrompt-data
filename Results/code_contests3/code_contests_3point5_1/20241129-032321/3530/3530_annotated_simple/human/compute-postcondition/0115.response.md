Postcondition: ***All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` is i + 1, `j` is as described in the initial state for the next iteration, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true.***
