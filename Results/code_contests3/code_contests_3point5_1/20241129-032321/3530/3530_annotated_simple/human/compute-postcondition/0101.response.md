Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to 0, `mask` is now equal to (1 << n) + 1, all elements at index `i - 1` of list `a` are equal to 1, for all `j`, `mask` has the j-th bit set to 1, and all `dp[i][mask]` have been updated and taken modulo `MOD`. For the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the `j-th` bit of `mask` is set to 1, then the postcondition holds true.***
