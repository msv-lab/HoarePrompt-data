Postcondition: ***`dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the 1 bit shifted by `j` position, then the value at `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of the current value at `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`.***
