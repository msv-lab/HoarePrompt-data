Example Answer: 
The code appends the result of map(int, raw_input().split()) to list `a`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again. The value of `_` is incremented by 1. The value of `MOD` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, list `a` contains the result of map(int, raw_input().split()).
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, list `a` contains the result of map(int, raw_input().split())**
