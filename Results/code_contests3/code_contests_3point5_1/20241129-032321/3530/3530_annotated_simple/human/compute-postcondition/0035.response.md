According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `dp` 2D list will contain updated values based on the provided formula. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be less than `1 << n + 1`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to: `dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged, and `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1`.
