Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the result of map(int, raw_input().split()) to list `a`. Since `a` already contains the result of map(int, raw_input().split()), the new result will be appended to the end of the list. The value of `MOD`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 2, list `a` contains the result of map(int, raw_input().split()) and the new result obtained from the code snippet.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 2, list `a` contains the result of map(int, raw_input().split()) and the new result obtained from the code snippet**
