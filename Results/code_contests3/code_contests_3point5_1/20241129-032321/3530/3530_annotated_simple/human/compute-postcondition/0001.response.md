Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `MOD` is known to be 1000000007, but the value of `n` is unknown as it depends on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, and `n` is the user input value.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000000007, `n` is the user input value**
