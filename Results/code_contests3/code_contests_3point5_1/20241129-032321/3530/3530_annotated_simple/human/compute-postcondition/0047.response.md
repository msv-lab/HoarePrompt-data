Postcondition: ***`dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, `mask` remain unchanged, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1, `j` is incremented by 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, the value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be the remainder of the current value at `dp[i][mask]` divided by `MOD`.***
