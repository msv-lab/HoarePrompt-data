According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` must be further incremented by 1. 
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 2, list `a` contains the result of map(int, raw_input().split())**
