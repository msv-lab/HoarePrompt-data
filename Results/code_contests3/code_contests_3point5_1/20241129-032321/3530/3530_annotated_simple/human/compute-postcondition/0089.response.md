Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. This ensures that the value remains within a certain range. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to n+1, `mask` is incremented by 1 and still less than (1 << n), element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated.
Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is equal to n+1, `mask` is incremented by 1 and still less than (1 << n), element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is equal to 1, j-th bit of `mask` is set to 1, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated**
