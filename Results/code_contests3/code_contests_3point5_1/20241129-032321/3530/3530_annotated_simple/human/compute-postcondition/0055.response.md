According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp` 2D list contains updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `i`, and `mask` remain unchanged, `mask` is less than `1 << n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `mask` is incremented by 1, the element at index `i - 1` of list `a` is 1, the `j`th bit of `mask` is also set to 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`**.
