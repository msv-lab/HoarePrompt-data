According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to the previous value. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and remain less than `n`.
State: **`dp` 2D list will contain updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than 0**
