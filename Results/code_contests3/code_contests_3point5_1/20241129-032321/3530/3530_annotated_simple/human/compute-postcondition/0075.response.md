Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list containing updated values, `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` is (1 << n), `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and `dp[i][mask]` is modulo divided by `MOD`.***
