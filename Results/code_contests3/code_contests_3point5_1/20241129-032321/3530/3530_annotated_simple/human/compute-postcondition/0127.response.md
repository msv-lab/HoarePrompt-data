Output State: **All elements of the 2D list `dp` have been updated based on the provided formula and taken modulo `MOD`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `mask` are within the range `1` to `1 << n`, `i` has been incremented by 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`, `a[i][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask & 1 << j` is true.**
