Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly reads the input, iterates over each character, and checks if it is one of the valid instructions ('H', 'Q', '9'). If any of these instructions are found, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If none of the instructions are found, it prints 'NO'. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem description.
