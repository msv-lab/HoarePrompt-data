Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, iterates through each character, and checks if it is one of the valid instructions ('H', 'Q', '9'). If it finds any valid instruction, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop. If it doesn't find any valid instruction, it prints "NO". This logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
