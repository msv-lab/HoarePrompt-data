Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is not empty without the first character being 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If `i` is in ['H', 'Q', '9'], and `a` is 'tstr123', then 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
