The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is 'tstr123', and we break out of the program execution.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is 'tstr123', and we break out of the program execution.**
