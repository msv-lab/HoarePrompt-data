According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`, which is the raw input. If the raw input is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, p is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is not empty. 
State: **`p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is not empty, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character in `a`**
