Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing a program in HQ9+ with ASCII codes between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is not empty without the first character being 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If `i` is 'H', 'Q', or '9', then `p` remains the same and `a` is 'tstr123' and the program execution breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `p` and `a`.***
