Functionality: **The function reads a string input `a`, iterates through each character in `a`, and checks if any character is 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and assigns the value 'tstr123' to `a`, then breaks out of the loop. After the loop, if `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
