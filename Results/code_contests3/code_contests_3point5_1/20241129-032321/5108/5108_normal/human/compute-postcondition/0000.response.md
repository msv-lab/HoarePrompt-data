Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes an input string from the user. The initial state mentions that `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters where each character's ASCII code is between 33 and 126 inclusive. The variable `a` now holds the input string provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters where each character's ASCII code is between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is the input string provided by the user.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters where each character's ASCII code is between 33 and 126 inclusive, `a` is the input string provided by the user**
