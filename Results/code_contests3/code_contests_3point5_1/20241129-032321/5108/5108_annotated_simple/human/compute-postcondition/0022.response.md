Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `p` as input and iterates through each character. If any character is 'H', 'Q', or '9', it prints 'YES' and assigns the string 'tstr123' to `a`. If none of the characters match, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value. The input string `p` must contain between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive.**
