Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` is not a valid function in Python 3, assuming it is meant to be `input()`, the user will be prompted to enter a value which will be stored in `a`. The initial state variable `p` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; a is a user input value.
Output State: **p is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive, with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, inclusive; a is a user input value**
