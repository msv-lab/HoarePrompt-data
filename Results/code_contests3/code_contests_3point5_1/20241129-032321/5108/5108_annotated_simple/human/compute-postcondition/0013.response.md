Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints 'YES' to the console. There is no change to the initial state variables `p` and `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is a valid user input value with more elements remaining.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is a valid user input value with more elements remaining**
