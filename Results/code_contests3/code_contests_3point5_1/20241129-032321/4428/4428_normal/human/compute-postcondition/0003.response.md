According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If N is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `result` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `N` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`result` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0**
