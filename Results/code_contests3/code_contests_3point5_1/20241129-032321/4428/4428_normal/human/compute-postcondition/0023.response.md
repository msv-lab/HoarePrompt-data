Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of only 'I' and 'D' characters. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and the count of non-'I's in the string `S`. If the result is negative, it sets the result to 0. Finally, it prints the resulting value. The function does not have any explicit return value, and it operates based on the input parameters `N` and `S`.**
