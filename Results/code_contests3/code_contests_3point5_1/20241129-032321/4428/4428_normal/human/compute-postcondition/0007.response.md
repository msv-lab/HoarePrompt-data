Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decreased by 1. Since the initial state of `result` is 0, after execution, the value of `result` becomes -1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is -1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, S[i] is not equal to 'I'.
Output State: **`result` is -1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, S[i] is not equal to 'I'**
