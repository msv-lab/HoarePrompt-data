Example Answer:
The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The possible values for `result` are 2, 0, -2, or -1. So after the execution, the new value of `result` will be 1, -1, -3, or -2. The value of `i` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is 1, -1, -3, or -2; `i` is 1.
Output State: **`result` is 1, -1, -3, or -2; `i` is 1**
