Postcondition: ***`result` is either 2, 0, -2, or -1 depending on whether the character at index `i` in list `S` is 'I' or not. If the character at index `i` is 'I', then `result` will be either 2 or -2 based on the condition in the if or else part respectively. If the character is not 'I', then `result` will be 0 or -1 based on the condition in the if or else part respectively. `i` remains 1, and `N` is greater than 0.***
