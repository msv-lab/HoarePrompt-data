Example Answer:
N is assigned the value of int(raw_input()), where raw_input() accepts an input and int() converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that N is a positive integer, after execution, N will hold a positive integer value. S is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, S is a string of length N consisting of only 'I' and 'D' characters**
