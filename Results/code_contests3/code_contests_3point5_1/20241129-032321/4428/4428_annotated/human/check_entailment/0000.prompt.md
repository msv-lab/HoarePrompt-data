You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have an integer variable x. Initially, x=0.

Some person gave you a string S of length N, and using the string you performed the following operation N times. In the i-th operation, you incremented the value of x by 1 if S_i=`I`, and decremented the value of x by 1 if S_i=`D`.

Find the maximum value taken by x during the operations (including before the first operation, and after the last operation).

Constraints

* 1≤N≤100
* |S|=N
* No characters except `I` and `D` occur in S.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the maximum value taken by x during the operations.

Examples

Input

5
IIDID


Output

2


Input

7
DDIDDII


Output

0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: **
def func():
    N = int(raw_input())
    S = raw_input()
    result = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if S[i] == 'I':
            result += 1
        else:
            result -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `S` is not defined, `result` can be any integer value, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `N` - 1. The final value of `result` depends on the occurrences of 'I' and other characters in the string `S` across all the iterations of the loop.
    if (result < 0) :
        result = 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`S` is not defined, `result` can be any integer value, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `N` - 1. If `result` is less than 0, the final value of `result` will depend on the occurrences of 'I' and other characters in the string `S` across all iterations of the loop.
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `N` from the user input, then reads a string `S` of length `N`. It iterates over the characters of `S` and increments the `result` by 1 for each occurrence of 'I' and decrements by 1 for other characters. If the final `result` is negative, it sets `result` to 0. The function then prints the final value of `result`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
