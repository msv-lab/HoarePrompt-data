Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` from the user input, then reads a string `S` of length `N`. It iterates over the characters of `S` and increments the `result` by 1 for each occurrence of 'I' and decrements by 1 for other characters. If the final `result` is negative, it sets `result` to 0. The function then prints the final value of `result`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
