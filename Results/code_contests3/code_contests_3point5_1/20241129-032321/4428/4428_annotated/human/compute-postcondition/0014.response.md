Example Answer:
`result` is increased by 1, where the previous value of `result` is either 2, 0, 1, or -2. The value of `result` will now be either 3, 1, 2, or -1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: NameError for `S`, `result` is either 3, 1, 2, or -1, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 2.
Output State: **NameError for `S`, `result` is either 3, 1, 2, or -1, `N` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 2**
