Postcondition: ***NameError for `S`, `result` is either 1 or -1, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0 and `i` starts at 0. If the character at index `i` in string `S` is 'I', then `result` is 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` in string `S` is not 'I', then `result` is -1.***
