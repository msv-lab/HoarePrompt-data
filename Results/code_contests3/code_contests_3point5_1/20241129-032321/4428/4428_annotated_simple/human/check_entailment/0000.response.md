Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It initializes a variable `result` to 0 and then iterates through the string `S`. For each character, if it is 'I', it increments `result` by 1, otherwise, it decrements `result` by 1. After processing all characters, it checks if the final value of `result` is less than 0 and sets it to 0 if true. Finally, it prints the maximum value of `result` achieved during the operations, which is the maximum value of `x` as required by the problem description.
