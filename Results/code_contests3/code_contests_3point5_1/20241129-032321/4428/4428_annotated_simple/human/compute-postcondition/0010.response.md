Example Answer: 
Since `result` is either 1 or -1, when we add 1 to it, it will become either 2 or 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is either 2 or 0, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `S` is a list of characters.
Output State: **`result` is either 2 or 0, `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `S` is a list of characters**
