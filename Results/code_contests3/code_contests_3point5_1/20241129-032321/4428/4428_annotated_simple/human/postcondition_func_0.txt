The function `func` reads a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. It then calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and the count of non-'I's in the string `S`, and if this difference is negative, it sets the result to 0. Finally, it prints the resultant value. The function does not have an explicit return value or specified output, but it processes the input parameters according to the constraints.
