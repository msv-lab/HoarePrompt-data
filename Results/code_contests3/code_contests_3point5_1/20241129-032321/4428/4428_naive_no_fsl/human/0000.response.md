Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description. It increments the value of x by 1 if S_i=`I` and decrements the value of x by 1 if S_i=`D`. The program then finds the maximum value taken by x during the operations as required. The constraints are also satisfied, and the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
