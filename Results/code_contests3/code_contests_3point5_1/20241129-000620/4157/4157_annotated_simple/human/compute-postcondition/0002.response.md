According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, and `i` is 0.
State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, `i` is 0**
