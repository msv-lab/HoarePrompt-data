Example Answer:
`t1` is calculated based on the conditional statement. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is assigned the value of `(v / a) + ((d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v)`. Otherwise, `t1` is assigned the square root of `(2 * d / a)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `d`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are float values obtained from splitting the raw input, and `t1` is calculated based on the given formula.
