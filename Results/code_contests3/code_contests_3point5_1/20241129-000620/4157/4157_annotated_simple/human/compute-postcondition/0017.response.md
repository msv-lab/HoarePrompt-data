Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input, `t1` is calculated based on the user input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`, and `t` is updated accordingly, and the final value of `t` is the maximum value calculated throughout all iterations of the loop.**
