Example Answer:
`n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values obtained from splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. The input is taken as a string and then split into separate values. As `t` is not used in the code snippet, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a floating-point number, `n`, `a`, and `d` are integer values obtained from the input.
Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `n`, `a`, and `d` are integer values obtained from the input**
