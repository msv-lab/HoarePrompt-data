According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a floating-point number. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`t` is a floating-point number, for the loop to execute another time `i` needs to be increased by 1**
