Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values returned by `map(float, raw_input().split())`. Since `t` is a floating-point number, there is no direct impact on `t`, but `ti` and `v` are now assigned floating-point values based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a floating-point number, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input.
Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input**
