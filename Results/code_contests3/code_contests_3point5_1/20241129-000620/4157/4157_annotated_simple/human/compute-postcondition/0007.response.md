According to the code, the loop can execute based on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are float values, `t1` is calculated, and the value of `t` is printed. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, `i` is 1, `ti` and `v` are float values obtained from splitting the raw input, `t1` is calculated based on the given formula, and the value of `t` is printed**
