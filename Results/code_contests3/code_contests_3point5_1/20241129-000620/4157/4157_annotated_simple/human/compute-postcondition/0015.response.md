Example Answer:
The value of `t1` is calculated based on user input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`. Then, `t` is updated to the maximum value between the sum of `t1` and `ti` and the current value of `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a floating-point number, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input, `t1` is calculated based on the user input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`, and `t` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input, `t1` is calculated based on the user input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`, and `t` is updated accordingly**
