Example Answer:
`t1` is assigned the value `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, otherwise it is assigned the value `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. The values of `v`, `a`, and `d` are based on user input, so the final value of `t1` will depend on those inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a floating-point number, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input, `t1` is calculated based on the user input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`.
Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `ti` and `v` are assigned floating-point values based on user input, `t1` is calculated based on the user input values of `v`, `a`, and `d`**
