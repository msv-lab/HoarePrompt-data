Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and `t`, where `t1` is calculated based on a formula and `ti` is a float value. The value of `t` will be updated to the maximum of the two values. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are float values obtained from splitting the raw input, `t1` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number, `n` is greater than 0, `a` and `d` are integer values obtained from the input, `i` is 0, `ti` and `v` are float values obtained from splitting the raw input, `t1` is calculated based on the given formula**
