Example Answer:
`t` is calculated as the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. Since the initial state of `t` is a floating-point number, and the values of `t1` and `ti` are not provided, the exact value of `t` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a floating-point number.
Output State: **`t` is a floating-point number**
