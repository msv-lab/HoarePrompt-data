Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `a`, and `d`, then iterates `n` times to calculate a time value `t` based on user input. It computes `t1` based on certain conditions and updates `t` to the maximum value calculated during the loop. The function prints the final `t` value. The function does not return any value explicitly. **
