Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum time for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the given inputs. It follows the logic described in the problem description:
- It calculates the time `t1` for each trolleybus to reach the final station if it can accelerate and decelerate with the given acceleration `a`.
- It then updates the overall time `t` by taking the maximum of the calculated time `t1` and the time `ti` at which the trolleybus leaves the depot.
- Finally, it prints the final time `t` for each trolleybus in the order they are given in the input.

The program uses the correct formulas and logic to determine the arrival time for each trolleybus, ensuring that they do not overtake each other and arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.
