Example Answer:
The value of `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`. The variables `t1` and `ti` are not given in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The output state is: the updated value of `t` is stored as the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current `t`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `ti` and `v` are assigned new float values.
