According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Before the loop starts, t is 0.0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and `a`, `d` are assigned integer values from the input. 
State: **t is 0.0, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `d` are assigned integer values from input**
