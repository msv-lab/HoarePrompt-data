Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned float values by splitting the input. The values of `ti` and `v` are updated based on the input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated based on the given formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `d` have assigned integer values from input, `ti` and `v` are updated float values.
Output State: **`t` is updated based on the given formula, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `d` have assigned integer values from input, `ti` and `v` are updated float values**
