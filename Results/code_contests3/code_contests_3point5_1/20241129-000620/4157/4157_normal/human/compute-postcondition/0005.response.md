Example Answer: 
The value of t is updated to the maximum value between t1 + ti and the current value of t. The previous values of t, t1, and ti are unknown, but n, a, and d are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: t is updated based on the given formula, n is greater than or equal to 0, a and d have assigned integer values from input, ti is a float, v is a float.
Output State: **t is updated based on the given formula, n is greater than or equal to 0, a and d have assigned integer values from input, ti is a float, v is a float**
