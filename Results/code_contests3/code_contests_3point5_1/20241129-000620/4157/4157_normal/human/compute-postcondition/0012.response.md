According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `t` was printed to the console. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **The value of `t` will be printed to the console, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i**.
