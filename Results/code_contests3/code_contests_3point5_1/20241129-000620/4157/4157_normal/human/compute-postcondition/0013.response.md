Example Answer:
`ti` and `v` are assigned the values of `map(float, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` accepts input separated by spaces and `map(float, ...)` converts each input to a float. The variables `t`, `i`, and `n` are not affected. 
Output State: **The value of `t` will be printed to the console, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. `ti` and `v` are assigned new float values.**
