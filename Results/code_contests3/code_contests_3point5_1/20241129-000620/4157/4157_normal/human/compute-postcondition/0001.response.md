Example Answer: 
`n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the initial state does not provide information on the input values, the output state is: t is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from input.
Output State: **t is 0.0, `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned integer values from input**
