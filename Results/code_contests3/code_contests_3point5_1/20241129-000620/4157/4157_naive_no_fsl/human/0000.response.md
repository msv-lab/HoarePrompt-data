Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, and distance to the final station.
2. It then iterates through each trolleybus and calculates the minimum time it takes to reach the final station based on the given acceleration and speed.
3. The program correctly handles the scenario where a trolleybus catches up with another one, ensuring they arrive at the final station together.
4. The output is printed for each trolleybus with the calculated arrival time.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and logic provided, and there are no potential cases identified where it does not work as expected.
