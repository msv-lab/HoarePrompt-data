Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the time each trolleybus arrives at the final station based on the given inputs of acceleration, maximum speed, and distance. The logic used to calculate the arrival time for each trolleybus seems to be correct and aligns with the problem description. The program iterates through each trolleybus and calculates the time taken for that trolleybus to reach the final station considering the acceleration, maximum speed, and distance. The program then prints the calculated arrival time for each trolleybus. 

Overall, the program seems to handle all potential cases as described in the problem description and there are no obvious issues that would cause it to give incorrect results.
