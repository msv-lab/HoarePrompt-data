Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input correctly, calculates the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on the provided formulas in the problem description, and prints the correct time for each trolleybus. The program ensures that trolleybuses cannot overtake each other and that they reach the final station as quickly as possible. The maximum time taken among all trolleybuses is stored in `t`, ensuring that the final output is correct.

Overall, the program follows the problem description accurately and provides the expected output for all cases.
