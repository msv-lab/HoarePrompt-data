The function `func` reads inputs for the number of trolleybuses, acceleration, and distance. Then, for each trolleybus, it calculates the time taken to reach the destination based on given formulas. The maximum time taken among all trolleybuses is stored in `t`, but the function does not explicitly return any value.
