According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `d` remain unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `ti`, `v`, and `t1` remain unchanged**
