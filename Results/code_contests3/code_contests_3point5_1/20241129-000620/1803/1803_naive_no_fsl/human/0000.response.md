Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. It only considers every third character after the first character, which is not the correct approach. For example, if the input is "{b, a, b, a}", the program will output 1 instead of 2. This is because it only considers the characters at index 1 and 4 (0-based indexing) and ignores the duplicate characters.
