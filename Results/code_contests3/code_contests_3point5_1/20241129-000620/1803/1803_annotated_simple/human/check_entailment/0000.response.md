Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The program only considers every third character in the input string, which is not the correct approach to count the distinct letters. The program should split the input string by commas and spaces, then count the number of unique elements in the resulting list. As a result, the program does not follow the problem description and will not provide the correct output for all potential cases.
