Functionality: ** The function reads an input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in brackets. It then extracts and prints the unique letters at specific positions in the string based on the value of `k`. The output is the count of unique letters extracted. If the input string length is less than or equal to 2, or if `k + 3` never exceeds the length of the input string, the function may not extract any letters or may not terminate properly. **
