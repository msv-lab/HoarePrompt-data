Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `k + 3`. The previous value of `k` is unknown, so after execution, `k` will be `k + 3`. The loop will execute again if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is assigned the input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 and the loop will execute again if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4; `k` is `k + 3`.
