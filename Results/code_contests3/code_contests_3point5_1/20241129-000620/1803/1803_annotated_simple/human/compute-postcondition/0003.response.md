According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and also greater than 2. Right before the loop, `Cadena` is assigned the input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets, `Arreglo` is an empty list, and `k` is assigned the value 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than 1 and greater than 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`Cadena` is assigned the input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` is an empty list; `k` is assigned the value 1, for the loop to execute the first time then length of `Cadena` is greater than 1 and length of `Cadena` is greater than 2**
