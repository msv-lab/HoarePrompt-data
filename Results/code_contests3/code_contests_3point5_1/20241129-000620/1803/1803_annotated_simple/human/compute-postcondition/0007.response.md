Example Answer:
The element at index 4 of `Arreglo` is added to the list `Arreglo`. The loop will execute again if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is assigned the input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 and the loop will execute again if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is assigned the input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets; `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4 and the loop will execute again if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4**
