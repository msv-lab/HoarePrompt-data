Example Answer:
The element at index 4 of `Cadena` is added to the `Arreglo` list. The loop will execute again if the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4, and `k` is incremented by 3. The previous states of the variables are not directly provided, so we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is assigned the input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in opening and closing curved brackets, `Arreglo` contains the element at index 4, `k` is `k + 3` for the loop to execute again, and the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4.
