Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The logic used in the program is incorrect. It extracts every 3rd character from the input string, assuming that the letters are separated by a comma and a space. However, this logic is flawed and will not work for all cases.

For example, if the input is "{a, b, c, a, d, e}", the program will output 2 instead of 5, as it only considers every 3rd character.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases described in the problem.
