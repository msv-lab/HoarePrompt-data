Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The code is extracting characters at specific indices based on the loop condition, but it is not correctly handling duplicate letters. For example, in the input "{b, a, b, a}", the code will only count 'a' and 'b' as distinct letters, resulting in an incorrect output of 2 instead of the expected 3. The code is not accurately capturing and counting all distinct letters in the set as required by the problem description.
