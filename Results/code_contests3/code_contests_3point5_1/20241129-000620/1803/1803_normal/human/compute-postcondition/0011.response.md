Example Answer:
k is updated by adding 3, so the new value of k will be the previous value of k plus 3. The loop will execute again with the updated value of k. Therefore, the Output State is: Arreglo is updated with the value at index k from Cadena, k is updated by adding 12 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **Arreglo is updated with the value at index k from Cadena, k is updated by adding 12 for the loop to execute again**
