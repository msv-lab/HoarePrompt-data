Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, so the new value of `k` depends on the initial value. Therefore, the Output State is: Arreglo` is updated with the value at index `k` from `Cadena`, `k` is updated by adding 3.
Output State: **Arreglo` is updated with the value at index `k` from `Cadena`, `k` is updated by adding 3**
