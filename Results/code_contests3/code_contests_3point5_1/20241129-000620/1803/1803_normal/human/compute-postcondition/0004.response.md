Example Answer:
The value at index `k` in the list `Cadena` is appended to the `Arreglo` list. The initial state does not provide specific values for `Arreglo`, `Cadena`, or `k`, so the output state will depend on the specific values of these variables. 
Output State: **Arreglo` is updated with the value at index `k` from `Cadena`**
