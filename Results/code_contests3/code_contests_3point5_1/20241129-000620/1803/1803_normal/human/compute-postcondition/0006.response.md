According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Cadena` and `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `Arreglo` is updated with the value at index `k` from `Cadena`, and `k` is updated by adding 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted by adding 3 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Arreglo is updated with the value at index k from Cadena, k is updated by adding 6 for the loop to execute again**
