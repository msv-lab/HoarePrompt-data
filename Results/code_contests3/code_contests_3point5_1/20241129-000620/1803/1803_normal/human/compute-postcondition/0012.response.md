Output State: **Arreglo` contains the elements at indices k, k+3, k+6, k+9, ..., k+n*3 from `Cadena`, where n is the number of times the loop executed. `k` is updated to k + 3*(n+1), where n is the number of times the loop executed, and the loop stops when the condition len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2 is no longer satisfied.**
