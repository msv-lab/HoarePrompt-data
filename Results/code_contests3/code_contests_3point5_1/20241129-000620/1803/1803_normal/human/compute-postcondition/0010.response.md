Example Answer:
Arreglo is updated with the value at index k from Cadena, where k is incremented by 12 for the loop to execute again. The previous values of Arreglo, Cadena, and k are not given, so we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: Arreglo is updated with the value at index k from Cadena, k is updated by adding 12 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **Arreglo is updated with the value at index k from Cadena, k is updated by adding 12 for the loop to execute again**
