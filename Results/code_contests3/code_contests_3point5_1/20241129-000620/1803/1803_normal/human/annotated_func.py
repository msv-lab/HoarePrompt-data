#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input string contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets.**
def func():
    Cadena = raw_input()
    Arreglo = []
    k = 1
    while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
        Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
        
        k = k + 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Arreglo` contains the elements at indices k, k+3, k+6, k+9, ..., k+n*3 from `Cadena`, where n is the number of times the loop executed. `k` is updated to k + 3*(n+1), where n is the number of times the loop executed, and the loop stops when the condition len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2 is no longer satisfied.
    print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input string that contains small English letters separated by commas and enclosed within opening and closing curved brackets. It then extracts characters at specific indices based on the loop condition and stores them in a list `Arreglo`. Finally, it prints the number of unique elements in `Arreglo`. The function does not accept any parameters. The annotations mention updating the index `k` and stopping the loop based on the length of `Cadena`, but it does not provide a clear overall purpose or return value for the function.
