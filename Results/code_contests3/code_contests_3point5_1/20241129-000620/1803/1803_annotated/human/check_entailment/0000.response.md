Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program reads the input string and extracts specific letters based on an incorrect index pattern [1, 4, 7, ...]. This does not account for all the letters in the input set. Additionally, the program does not handle duplicate letters properly, as it uses a set to count unique letters in `Arreglo`, which may not give the correct count.

Therefore, the program does not correctly count the total number of distinct letters in Anton's set.
