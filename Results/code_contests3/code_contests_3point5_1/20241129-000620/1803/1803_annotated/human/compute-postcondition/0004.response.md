Example Answer:
The value at index `k` of `Cadena` is added to the list `Arreglo`. As `k` is 1, the second letter of `Cadena` is added to `Arreglo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 1.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
