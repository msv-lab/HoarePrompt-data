According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `Cadena` and the value of `k`. If the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2, the loop can execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, and `k` is 4. 
For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than 4 and greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 4, for the loop to execute again the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4**
