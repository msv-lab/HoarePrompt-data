Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 3, and the previous value of `k` is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
