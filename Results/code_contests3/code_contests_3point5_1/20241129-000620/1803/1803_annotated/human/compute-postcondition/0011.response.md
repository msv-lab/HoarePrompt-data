Example Answer:
`k` is updated to `k + 3`, where `k` is 7. After execution, `k` becomes 10. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second and the fifth letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 10, for the loop to execute again the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4, `Arreglo` is updated to include the letter at index 7 of `Cadena`.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a set of letters with a length greater than 2, `Arreglo` contains the second and the fifth letter of `Cadena`, `k` is 10, for the loop to execute again the length of `Cadena` is greater than 4, `Arreglo` is updated to include the letter at index 7 of `Cadena`**
