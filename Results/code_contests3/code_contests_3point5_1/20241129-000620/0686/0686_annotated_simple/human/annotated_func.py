#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are all integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints provided for the integers n, m, a, and b. The function performs a specific operation based on these values but does not return any specific value or message. It lacks clarity on the actual operation being performed due to the absence of code within the function block.
