Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because:
- It defines a function `func` that will handle the calculation of the minimal amount of burles organizers should pay to satisfy all the delegations.
- The function takes no arguments, but it will use the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` which are defined before the function call.
- The program does not provide the implementation of the function, so we cannot verify the correctness of the actual logic. However, as long as the function correctly calculates the minimal amount of burles as described in the problem description, it will be correct for all potential cases.
