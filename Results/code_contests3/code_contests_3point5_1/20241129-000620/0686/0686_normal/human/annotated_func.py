#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns the result of the expression `(n//a) * (m//b)`, where n, m, a, and b are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. The function does not perform any calculations and returns an empty dictionary {}
