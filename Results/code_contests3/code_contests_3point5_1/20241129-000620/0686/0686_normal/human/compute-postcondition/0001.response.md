The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the result of the expression `(n//a) * (m//b)`, where n, m, a, and b are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the result of the expression `(n//a) * (m//b)` given the constraints on the input parameters.
