Initial State: n, m, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.

```
n += a
m -= b
```

Example Answer:
n is increased by the value of a, and m is decreased by the value of b. The previous values of n, m, a, and b are unknown, so the output state is: n is increased by a, m is decreased by b.
Output State: **n is increased by a, m is decreased by b**
