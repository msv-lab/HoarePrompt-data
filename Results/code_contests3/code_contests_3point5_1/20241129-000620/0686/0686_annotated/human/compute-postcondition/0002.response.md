Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the squares of integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and returns the result. The annotation states the initial states of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, but since the function does not use these parameters, their values are irrelevant to the function's execution.**
