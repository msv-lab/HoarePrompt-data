#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 10^12 and 1 <= a, b <= 100.**
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the sum of the squares of integers from `a` to `b` (inclusive) and returns the result. The annotation states the initial states of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, but since the function does not use these parameters, their values are irrelevant to the function's execution.
