Example Answer:
The value of `x` is the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`. Then, the code prints the result of `(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)` after converting it to an integer by using `int()`. Since we are using the `ceil` function, the result will be rounded up to the nearest integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `x` is the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`, the printed value is the rounded up result of the expression `(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)`.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `x` is the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`, the printed value is the rounded up result of the expression `(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)`**
