Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`. Since `b` and `c` are input integers, their values can vary. Therefore, the value of `x` will be dependent on the input values of `b` and `c`. 
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `x` is the result of dividing the maximum of `b` and `c` by the minimum of `b` and `c`**
