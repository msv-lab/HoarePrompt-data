Example Answer: 
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input().split()`. The values are then converted to integers. The specific values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
