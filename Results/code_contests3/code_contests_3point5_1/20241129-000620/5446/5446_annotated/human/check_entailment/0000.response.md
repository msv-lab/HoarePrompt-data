Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description as it does not calculate the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cakes in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake. Instead, it calculates a different value based on the input which does not match the requirements of the problem description. Additionally, the program does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to the input values.
