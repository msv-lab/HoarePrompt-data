Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

1. The code incorrectly reads the input values as `b` and `c` instead of `b` and `c`, as mentioned in the problem description. This can lead to incorrect calculations.
2. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of pieces on each plate is incorrect. It should be based on the minimum of `a` and `b`, not the maximum. This can lead to incorrect results for certain input values.
3. The code uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3, it should use `input()` instead.
