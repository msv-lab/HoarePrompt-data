Example Answer:
n, b, and c are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The values of a are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values of n, b, and c. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; n, b, and c are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers.
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; n, b, and c are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers.**
