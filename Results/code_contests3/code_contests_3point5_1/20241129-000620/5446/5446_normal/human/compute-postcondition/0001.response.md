Example Answer:
The value of x is calculated by dividing the maximum value between b and c by the minimum value between b and c. As a, b, and n are not involved in this calculation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; x is a float value based on the division of max(b, c) by min(b, c).
Output State: **a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; x is a float value based on the division of max(b, c) by min(b, c)**
