The function `func` accepts no parameters explicitly defined in the function signature. However, it implicitly accepts three integer parameters: `a`, `b`, and `n`, where `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The function does not have any explicit return value specified. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to implicitly accept three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`, with the constraints mentioned above. The function does not have an explicit return value stated.
