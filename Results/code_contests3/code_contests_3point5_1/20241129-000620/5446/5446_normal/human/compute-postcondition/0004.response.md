Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers from the user input, calculates a value based on those inputs, and prints the result. It implicitly accepts three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `n`, where `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The function calculates a value based on the input integers and prints the result without returning any value explicitly.**
