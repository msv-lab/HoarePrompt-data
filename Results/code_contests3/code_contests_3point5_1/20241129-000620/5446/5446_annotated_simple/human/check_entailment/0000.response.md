Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 
1. The program reads the input values into variables n, b, and c, but the input should be n, a, and b.
2. The calculation of x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)) is incorrect. It should be x = min(b, c) / n.
3. The calculation of the final result is also incorrect. It should be print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))) without the max function.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not produce the correct output for all cases.
