Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the result of `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))` but there are variables `c` and `x` that are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b**
