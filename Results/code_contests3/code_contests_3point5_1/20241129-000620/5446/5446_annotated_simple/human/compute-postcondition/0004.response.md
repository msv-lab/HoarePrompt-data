Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integer inputs `n`, `b`, and `c`, calculates a value `x` based on the ratio of the maximum and minimum of `b` and `c`, and then prints an integer result based on a formula involving `n`, `b`, `c`, and `x`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, instead, it reads inputs from the user. The return value of the function depends on the calculated result and the constraints on `a`, `b`, and `n`. The function does not handle cases where the inputs violate the specified constraints or if there are any potential division by zero errors.**
