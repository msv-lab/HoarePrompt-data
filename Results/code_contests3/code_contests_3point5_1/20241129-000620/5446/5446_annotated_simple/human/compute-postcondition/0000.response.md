Example Answer:
`n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on the input received after splitting the input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` are unknown, so the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input**
