Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the maximum between `b` and `c` divided by the minimum between `b` and `c`. Since the initial state does not provide values for `c`, the output state will not be affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b.**
