The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return a string based on the integer values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. The constraints specify that `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 100, and `n` is an integer between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b`. The return value of the function will vary based on the relationship between the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`.
