Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not consider the case where the number of plates is less than the minimum number of pieces of cake on a plate. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, for the input:
```
3 5 4
```
The program should output `2` as the maximum possible number of pieces on a plate. However, the program will output `4` which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description and is incorrect.
