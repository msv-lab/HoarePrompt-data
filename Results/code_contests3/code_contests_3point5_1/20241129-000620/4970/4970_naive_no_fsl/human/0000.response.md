Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program takes an integer input and directly accesses the corresponding index in a pre-defined list to output the result. Since the input is limited to the range 0 to 15 as per the problem description, and the list contains all the mappings for these inputs, the program covers all possible cases and works correctly for all potential inputs.
