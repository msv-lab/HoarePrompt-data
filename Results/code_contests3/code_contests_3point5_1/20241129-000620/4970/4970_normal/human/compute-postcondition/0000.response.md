Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value from the list based on the input given. The input is taken using `raw_input()`, converted to an integer, and then used as an index to retrieve a value from the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Since the initial state is that `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, the output state will depend on the input value provided when running the code.
Output State: **Prints the value from the list based on the input provided.**
