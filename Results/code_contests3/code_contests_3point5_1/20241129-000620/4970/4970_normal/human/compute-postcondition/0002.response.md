Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prints a value based on the user's input, which should be an integer in the range 0 to 15 (inclusive). The function accesses a specific index in a predefined list based on the input integer and prints the corresponding value. However, the actual functionality described in the annotations about returning categories ("low", "medium", "high") based on the value of `a` is missing in the code. **
