Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the input should be a single integer in the range 0 to 15 (inclusive) and the output should be a single integer. However, the code directly prints a value from a predefined list based on the user's input without any consideration for the range or type of input. Additionally, the code does not implement any logic to handle invalid inputs or define the expected output for different input values.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints do not provide any additional information that would suggest otherwise.
