Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes an integer input, then uses that input to index into a list of integers and prints the corresponding integer. Since the input range is specified as 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, and the list contains 16 integers, the program covers all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct for all possible inputs as per the problem description.
