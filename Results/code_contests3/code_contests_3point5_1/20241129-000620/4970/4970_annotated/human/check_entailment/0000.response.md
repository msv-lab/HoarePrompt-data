Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func` that takes no parameters. The function prompts the user for input and then prints the corresponding element from a predefined list based on the input provided. Since the problem description specifies that the input will be a single integer between 0 and 15, the program is correct in this case. It handles all possible inputs within the specified range and provides the correct output.
