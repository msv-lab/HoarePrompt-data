Example Answer:
The code prints the element at the index given by the user input from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input is converted to an integer, the index will be between 0 and 15. Therefore, the Output State is: a is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15.
Output State: **a is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15**
