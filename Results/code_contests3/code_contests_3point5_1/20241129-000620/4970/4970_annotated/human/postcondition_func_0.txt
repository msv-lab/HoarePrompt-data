The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user for input and prints the corresponding element from a predefined list based on the input provided. The function assumes input will be an integer within the range of 0 to 15. If the input is outside this range, the function will encounter an index out of range error. The function does not explicitly return any value.
