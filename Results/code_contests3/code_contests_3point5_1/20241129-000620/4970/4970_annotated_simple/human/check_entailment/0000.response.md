Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input and uses it as an index to access a specific element from a pre-defined list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since the input range is specified as 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, the program will always output the correct integer from the list based on the input given. Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
