The function `func` does not accept any parameters. When called, it prompts the user for input and based on the input value, it prints a specific element from a predefined list. The input value must be an integer between 0 and 15 (inclusive). If the input value is outside this range, the function will result in an `IndexError` due to accessing an out-of-bounds index in the list. The function does not return any values but provides output based on the input provided.
