Example Answer:
t and x are assigned values by mapping float conversions of input split by spaces. Since the values of T and X can be any integers between 1 and 100, the values of t and x can be any float values. Therefore, the Output State is: T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100; t and x are input float values.
Output State: **T and X are integers such that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100; t and x are input float values**
