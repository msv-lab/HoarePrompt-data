Example Answer:
`t` and `x` are assigned the values of `float(input().split())`, where `input` accepts an input and `split` splits the input based on spaces. Since `map` is used to convert the inputs to float, `t` and `x` will be floating-point numbers. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` and `X` are floating-point numbers.
Output State: **T and X are floating-point numbers**
