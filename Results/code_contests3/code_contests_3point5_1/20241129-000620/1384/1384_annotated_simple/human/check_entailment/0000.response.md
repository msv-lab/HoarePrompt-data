Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It takes two integers T and X as input, where T represents the number of hours Taro needs to study in World B and X represents the speed at which time passes in World B compared to World A. The program then calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T by X and prints the result.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description for all potential cases within the specified constraints, it is deemed correct.
