Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two float values `t` and `x` from the input and prints the result of `t / x`, which is the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B. The code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The input constraints ensure that the input values are within the specified range, and the code correctly calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A based on the input values. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct.
