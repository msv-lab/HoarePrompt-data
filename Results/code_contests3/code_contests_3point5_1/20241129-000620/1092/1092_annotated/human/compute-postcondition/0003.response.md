According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0. So for the loop to be executed the list `l` must have at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list**
