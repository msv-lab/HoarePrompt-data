Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0**
