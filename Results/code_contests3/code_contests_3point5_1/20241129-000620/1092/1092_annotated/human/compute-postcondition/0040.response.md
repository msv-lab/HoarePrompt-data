According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `i`. If `i` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `s` is the total count of uppercase words in the list `i`, `m` is updated to be the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, there are more elements left in the list `l` to process, `s` is the total count of uppercase words in the current list `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must not be empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is a list of words with at least 2 words and is not empty, `s` is the total count of uppercase words in the list `i`, there are more elements left in the list `l` to process**
