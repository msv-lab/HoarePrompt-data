According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If there are more words left in the list `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last word in the list and it is in uppercase. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more words left in the list `i` and the next word in the list after `j` must also be in uppercase.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `s` is 1, `j` is the next word in the list after the current `j` and it is in uppercase**
