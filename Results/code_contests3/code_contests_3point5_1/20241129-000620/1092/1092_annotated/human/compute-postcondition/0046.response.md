Example Answer:
Since the code only prints the value of `m`, and no calculations or modifications are done to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing words from the text, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word in the list `l`**
