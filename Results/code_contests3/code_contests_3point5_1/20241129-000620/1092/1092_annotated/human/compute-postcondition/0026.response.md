According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` still contains words, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `s` is 2, `j` is the next word in the list after the current `j` and it is in uppercase. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should still contain words.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `s` is 2, `j` is the next word in the list after the current `j` and it is in uppercase, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should still contain words**
