Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, and the word `j` is uppercase.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, and the word `j` is uppercase**
