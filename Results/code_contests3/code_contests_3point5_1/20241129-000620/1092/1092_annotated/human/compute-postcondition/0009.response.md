According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If there are more words in the list `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, and the word `j` is uppercase. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more words in the list `i` and `j` should be the next word in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, `s` is 1, and the word `j` is uppercase**
