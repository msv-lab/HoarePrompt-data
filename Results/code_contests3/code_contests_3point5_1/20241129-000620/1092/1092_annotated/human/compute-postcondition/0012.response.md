According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is iterable, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next word in the list, `s` is 2, and the word `j` is uppercase. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next word `i` should be iterable.
State: *`n` is a positive integer, `l` is a list containing words from the text with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the next iterable word in the list, `s` is 2, and the word `j` is uppercase*
