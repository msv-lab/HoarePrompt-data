According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If there are more words in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 1 word, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the last word in the list, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more word in the list `l`, and the value of `i` should be the next word in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` contains words with at least 2 words, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `i` is the second last word in the list, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in all words**
