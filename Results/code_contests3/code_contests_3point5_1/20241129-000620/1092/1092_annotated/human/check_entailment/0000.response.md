Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input text and splits it into words. It then iterates over each word to count the number of uppercase letters in that word. It keeps track of the maximum count of uppercase letters seen in any word. Finally, it prints out this maximum count, which corresponds to the volume of the text as defined in the problem description.

The program correctly calculates the volume of the given text by counting the number of capital letters in each word and finding the maximum count among all words. It follows the problem description for all potential cases.
