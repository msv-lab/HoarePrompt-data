Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly and splits the text into words. It then iterates through each word, counts the number of capital letters in each word, and keeps track of the maximum count found. Finally, it outputs the maximum count as the volume of the text. The program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for the given examples. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
