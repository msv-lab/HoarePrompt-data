Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, splits the text into words, and calculates the volume of the text based on the number of capital letters in each word. It then outputs the maximum volume found. The program iterates through each word and counts the number of capital letters in each word correctly. Finally, it updates the maximum volume found and prints it. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and produces the correct output.
