Example Answer:
`s` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s` will be the previous value of `s` plus 1. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a non-empty list with more elements, `s` is the updated value after incrementing by 1, for the loop to execute `i` is an iterable object, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
