The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, based on the constraints provided, it can be inferred that the function operates on a text input consisting of n words separated by single spaces, where n is a positive integer representing the length of the text. Each word in the text contains only small and capital Latin letters. The function processes this input text in some way, but the exact functionality is not specified in this case.
