Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next uppercase letter in `i` should be considered. If `j` is an uppercase letter, the state remains the same as the precondition. If `j` is not an uppercase letter, there is no change in the state.***
