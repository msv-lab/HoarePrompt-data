According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `l` is not empty. Since `n` represents the length of the text, it implies that there are n words in the list `l`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `l` must not be empty. Additionally, since `m` is 0, it does not play a role in determining the execution of the loop. So, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, and `l` is a non-empty list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list**
