Example Answer:
The code `print(m)` simply outputs the value of `m`. Since there are no calculations or changes to the variables `n`, `m`, `l`, or `s`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word of the text, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in the last word of the text**
