Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the value 0. The states of `n`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is 0**
