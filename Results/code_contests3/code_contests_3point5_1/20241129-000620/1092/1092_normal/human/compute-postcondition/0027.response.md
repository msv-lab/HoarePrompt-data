Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1, which means `s` is updated. The value of `m` will be the maximum value between the previous value of `m` and `s`. The loop will execute again if `j` is an uppercase letter. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, m is the maximum value between s and the previous value of m, l is a non-empty list with more elements, s is the updated value after incrementing by 1, for the loop to execute again j is an uppercase letter.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is the maximum value between s and the previous value of m, l is a non-empty list with more elements, s is the updated value after incrementing by 1, for the loop to execute again j is an uppercase letter**
