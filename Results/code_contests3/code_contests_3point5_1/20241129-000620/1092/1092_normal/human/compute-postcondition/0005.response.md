According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is an iterable object, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `m` is 0 and `s` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute, `i` must be an iterable object, and `l` must be a non-empty list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` is an iterable object**
