Example Answer:
`s` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next uppercase letter in `i` should be considered.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next uppercase letter in `i` should be considered**
