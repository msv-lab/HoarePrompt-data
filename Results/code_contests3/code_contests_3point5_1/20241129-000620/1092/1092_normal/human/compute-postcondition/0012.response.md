According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. If there are more uppercase letters in `i` to iterate over, the loop will execute one more time.
At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next uppercase letter in `i` should be considered.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the text, `m` is 0, `l` is a non-empty list, `s` is increased by 1, for the loop to execute one more time the next uppercase letter in `i` should be considered**
