Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is updated to the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a non-empty list with more elements remaining, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in the list `l` and has been incremented by 1. The loop will execute one more time as `i` is still an iterable object with more elements.***
