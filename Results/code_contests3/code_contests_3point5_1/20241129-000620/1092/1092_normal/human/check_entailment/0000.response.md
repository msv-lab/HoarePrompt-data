Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It takes the text input, splits it into words, and then iterates through each word to count the number of uppercase letters in it. The maximum count of uppercase letters across all words is then stored and printed as the output, which is the volume of the text. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code and confirm that the implementation is correct.
