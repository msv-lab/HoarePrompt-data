Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. The value of `s` is equal to the total number of uppercase letters in all elements of `l`. The initial value of `m` is not provided, but it is compared with `s` to get the maximum value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words from the input, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase letters in `l` and the current value of `m`, `s` is equal to the total number of uppercase letters in all elements of `l`, `i` is an empty iterable object.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words from the input, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase letters in `l` and the current value of `m`, `s` is equal to the total number of uppercase letters in all elements of `l`, `i` is an empty iterable object**
