Example Answer: 
`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown, so after execution, `s` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is within the range 1 to 200, l contains at least two words, m is the maximum value between the number of uppercase letters in l and the current value of m, s is incremented by 1, i has iterated over some elements in l and is now pointing to the next element for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time i must be an iterable object, and j is an uppercase letter.
