Example Answer:
The value of `s` is increased by 1. Given that the initial value of `s` is 1, after execution, `s` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word from the input, `m` is 0, `s` is 2, `i` is defined and contains a value that allows the loop to execute, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must still be iterable.
