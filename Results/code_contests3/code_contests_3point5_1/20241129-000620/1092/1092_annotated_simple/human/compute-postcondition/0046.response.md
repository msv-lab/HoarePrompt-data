Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `m`, which represents the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word in the list `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing words from the input, `m` is the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word in `l`, `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in all elements of `l`, `i` is an empty iterable object and `m` is printed.
