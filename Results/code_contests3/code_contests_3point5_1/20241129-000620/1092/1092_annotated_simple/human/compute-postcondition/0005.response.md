According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine if the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `i` is defined and contains a value that allows the loop to execute. Additionally, since `m` and `s` are mentioned in the initial state, we need to ensure they are also properly adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word from the input, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `i` is defined and contains a value that allows the loop to execute**
