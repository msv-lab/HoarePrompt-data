Example Answer:
The value of m is updated to be the maximum between the total number of uppercase letters in l (s) and the current value of m. Therefore, m is updated to be the maximum value between s and m. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **n is within the range 1 to 200, l contains at least two words, m is the maximum value between the number of uppercase letters in l and the current value of m, s is the total number of uppercase letters in l, i has iterated over all elements in l and is now pointing to the next element for the next iteration**
