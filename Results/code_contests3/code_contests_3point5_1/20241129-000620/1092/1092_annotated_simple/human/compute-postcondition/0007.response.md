Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word from the input, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `i` is defined and contains a value that allows the loop to execute, the value of `j` is an uppercase letter.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word from the input, `m` is 0, `s` is 1, `i` is defined and contains a value that allows the loop to execute, the value of `j` is an uppercase letter**
