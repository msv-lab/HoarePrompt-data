According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the list `l` is not empty. Since `l` is a list containing individual words from the input, the loop will execute if there is at least one word in the list. At the start of the loop, `m` is 0, so it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the list `l` must have at least one word in it.
State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least one word from the input, `m` is 0**
