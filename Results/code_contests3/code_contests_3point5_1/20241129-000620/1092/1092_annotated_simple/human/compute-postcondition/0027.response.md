Example Answer:
The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s` will be the previous value of `s` plus 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing at least two words from the input, `m` is the maximum value between the number of uppercase letters in `l` and the current value of `m`, `s` is the incremented value by 3, `i` is an iterable object with at least one more element.
