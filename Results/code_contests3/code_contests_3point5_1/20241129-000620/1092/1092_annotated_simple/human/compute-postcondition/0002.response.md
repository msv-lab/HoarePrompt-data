Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value 0. Since the value of `m` is directly set to 0, there are no changes to other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input, `m` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200, `l` is a list containing the individual words from the input, `m` is 0**
