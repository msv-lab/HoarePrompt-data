Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes input N, Q, S and a list of queries. It then calculates the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the given range for each query and prints the result.

The program correctly initializes a list P of length N+1 to store the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to each index i. It then iterates through the string S and updates the values in P accordingly.

For each query, the program calculates the result by subtracting the number of occurrences of 'AC' up to index l from the number of occurrences up to index r, which gives the count of 'AC' in the given range [l, r].

The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
