Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of times the substring "AC" occurs in the specified range for each query. The program maintains a prefix sum array `P` where `P[i]` stores the number of times "AC" occurs in the substring of `S` from index 0 to i-1. Then for each query, it calculates the number of occurrences of "AC" in the range `[l, r)` by subtracting `P[l-1]` from `P[r-1]`. This logic is in line with the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
