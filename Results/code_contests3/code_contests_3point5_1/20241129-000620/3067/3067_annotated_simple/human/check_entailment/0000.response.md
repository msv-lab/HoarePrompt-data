Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the number of times the substring 'AC' occurs in the specified range of indices for each query. It does this by pre-computing an array `P` where `P[i]` stores the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring of `S` starting from index 0 up to index `i`.

During each query, the program simply calculates `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` to determine the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the specified range `[l, r]`.

The program follows the problem description by correctly handling all the constraints and requirements stated in the problem description.
