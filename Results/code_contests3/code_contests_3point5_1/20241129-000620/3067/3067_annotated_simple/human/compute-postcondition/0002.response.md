Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of 0s with a length of N + 1. N and Q are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and S is a string. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, S is a string, P is a list of 0s with a length of N + 1.
Output State: **N and Q are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, S is a string, P is a list of 0s with a length of N + 1**
