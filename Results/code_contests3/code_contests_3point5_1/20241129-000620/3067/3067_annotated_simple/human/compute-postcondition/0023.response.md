Postcondition: ***`N`, `Q` are integers, `S` is a string, `P` is a list of integers with length `N + 1`, `i` is less than `N + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` is assigned the value 0. In any case, the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
