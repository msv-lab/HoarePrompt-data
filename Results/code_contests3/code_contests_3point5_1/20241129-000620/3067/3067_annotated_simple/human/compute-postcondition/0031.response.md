According to the code, the loop will execute Q times, and the loop iteration depends on the value of Q. At the end of the previous iteration, N, Q, S, P, l, and r are provided. To execute the loop one more time, Q needs to be decremented by 1. 
State: **N and Q are integers, S is a string, P is a list of integers with length N + 1, l and r are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed, for the loop to execute one more time Q needs to be decremented by 1**
