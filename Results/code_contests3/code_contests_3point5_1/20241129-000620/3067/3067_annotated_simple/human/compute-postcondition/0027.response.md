Output State: **`N` and `Q` are integers, `S` is a string, `P` is a list of integers with length `N + 1`. After the loop executes, the values in `P` will be determined based on the conditions in the loop. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `P[i]` will be assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`.**
