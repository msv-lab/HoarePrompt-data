Output State: **N and Q are integers, S is a string, P is a list of integers with length N + 1, `i` is less than `N` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0, then P[0] is assigned the value 0 and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. After running the code snippet, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].**
