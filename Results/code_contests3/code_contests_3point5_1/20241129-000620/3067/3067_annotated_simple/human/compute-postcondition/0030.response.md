Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference between the element at index `r - 1` and the element at index `l - 1` in the list `P`. The values of `l` and `r` are obtained from splitting the input string. The values of `N`, `Q`, `S`, and the list `P` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `Q` are integers, `S` is a string, `P` is a list of integers with length `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed.
Output State: **`N` and `Q` are integers, `S` is a string, `P` is a list of integers with length `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed**
