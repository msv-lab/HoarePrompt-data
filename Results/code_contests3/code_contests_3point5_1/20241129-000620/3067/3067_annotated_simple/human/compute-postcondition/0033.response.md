Example Answer:
The code calculates the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1]. The values of r and l are obtained by splitting the input string. The difference is then printed. To execute the loop one more time, Q needs to be decremented by 1.
Output State: **N and Q are integers, S is a string, P is a list of integers with length N + 1, l and r are integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1] is printed. Q is decremented by 1 to continue the loop execution.**
