Output State: **`N`, `Q` are integers, `S` is a string, `P` is a list of integers with length `N + 1`, `i` is less than `N + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is equal to 0, then `P[0]` is assigned the value 0. In any case, the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop or statement. After executing the code snippet `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1`, the value of `P[i]` is incremented by 1 compared to the previous value of `P[i - 1]`.**
