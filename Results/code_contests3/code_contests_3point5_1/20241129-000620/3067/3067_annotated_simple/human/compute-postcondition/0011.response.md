Output State: **N and Q are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, S is a string, P is a list of 0s with a length of N + 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `N` is greater than 0, `P[0]` is assigned the value 0. The substring S[i - 1:i + 1] is not 'AC', `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`**
