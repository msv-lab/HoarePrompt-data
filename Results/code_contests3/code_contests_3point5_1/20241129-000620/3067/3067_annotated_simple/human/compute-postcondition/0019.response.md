Postcondition: ***N and Q are integers, S is a string, P is a list of integers with length N + 1, `i` is less than `N` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0, then P[0] is assigned the value 0 and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. After the execution of the code snippet, if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. Otherwise, P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
