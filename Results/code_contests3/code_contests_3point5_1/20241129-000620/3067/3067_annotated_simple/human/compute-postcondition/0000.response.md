Example Answer:
N and Q are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The values of N and Q are dependent on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
Output State: **N and Q are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**
