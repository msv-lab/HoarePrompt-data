Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values N, Q, and S, calculates a list P based on the conditions specified, and then processes the queries to find the number of times 'AC' occurs as a substring within the specified substrings of S. The final output is the correct count for each query. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
