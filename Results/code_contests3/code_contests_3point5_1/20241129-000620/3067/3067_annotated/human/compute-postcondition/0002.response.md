Example Answer:
P is a list initialized with (N+1) number of zeros. N and Q are obtained from splitting the raw input, and S is the string input from the user. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user; P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user; P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros**
