Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input with at least `N+1` characters, `P` is a list where `P[0] = 0` and is updated based on the condition `S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC'` for the loop to execute, `l` and `r` are assigned values based on input split, the difference between `P[r - 1]` and `P[l - 1]` is printed**
