Example Answer:
The string input from the user is stored in variable `S`. The variables `N` and `Q` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so their values remain the same as obtained from splitting the raw input. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user**
