Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, Q is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user, P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned the value 0. If the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is true, then P[i] is calculated as P[i - 1] + 1. If the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is false, then P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1].***
