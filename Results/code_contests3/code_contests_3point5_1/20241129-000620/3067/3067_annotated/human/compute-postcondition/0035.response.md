Example Answer:
`l` and `r` are assigned values from the input by mapping them to integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous values of `l` and `r` are unknown, so the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input with at least `N+1` characters, `P` is updated, `l` and `r` are assigned new input values, loop counter `_` is reset for the next iteration.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input with at least `N+1` characters, `P` is updated, `l` and `r` are assigned new input values, loop counter `_` is reset for the next iteration**
