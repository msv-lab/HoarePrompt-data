Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, Q is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is a string input from the user with at least i+2 characters, P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros, i is less than N, if i == 0, then P[0] is 0 and the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
