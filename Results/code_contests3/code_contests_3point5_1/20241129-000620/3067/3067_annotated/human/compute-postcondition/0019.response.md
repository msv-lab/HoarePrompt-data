Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, Q is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is a string input from the user with at least i+2 characters, P is a list that is updated differently based on the condition. If S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC', then P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1. If the condition is not met, then P remains initialized with (N+1) zeros. The value of i is less than N, and if i == 0, then P[0] is 0, and the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
