Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned P[i - 1] + 1. The previous values of the variables are N is a positive integer, Q is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user, P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned the value 0. When the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is true, the program moves to the next part. After execution, the value of P[i] will depend on the previous values of P[i - 1], so the states of N, Q, S, and other variables remain the same unless specified otherwise.
Output State: **N is a positive integer, Q is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is the string input from the user, P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros. If i == 0, P[0] is assigned the value 0. When the condition (S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC') is true, the program moves to the next part, the value of P[i] is calculated as P[i - 1] + 1.**
