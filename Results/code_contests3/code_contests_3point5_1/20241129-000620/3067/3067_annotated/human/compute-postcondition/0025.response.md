Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `Q` is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, `S` is a string input from the user with at least `i+2` characters, `P` is a list where `P[0] = 0` and is updated based on the condition `S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC'` where if true `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1`, else `P` remains initialized with `(N+1)` zeros. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `N` and is incremented by 1. After the code snippet runs, `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, updating the `P` list with the same value as the previous index.**
