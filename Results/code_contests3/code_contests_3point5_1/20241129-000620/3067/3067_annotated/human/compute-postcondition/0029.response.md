Example Answer:
The values of `l` and `r` are assigned the result of mapping `int` to the split input. Since the initial state does not mention the values of `l` and `r`, the output state will only include the information about the new variables created.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input with at least `N+1` characters, `P` is a list where `P[0] = 0` and is updated based on the condition `S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC'` for the loop to execute, `l` and `r` are assigned values based on input split**
