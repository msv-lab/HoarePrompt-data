Example Answer:
P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1]. The value of P[i - 1] depends on the previous iterations, so for the current iteration, P[i] remains the same as P[i - 1]. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer, Q is assigned values obtained from splitting the raw input, S is a string input from the user with at least i+2 characters, P is a list initialized with (N+1) zeros, i is less than N, if i == 0, then P[0] is 0 and the program continues without any changes to the variables.
