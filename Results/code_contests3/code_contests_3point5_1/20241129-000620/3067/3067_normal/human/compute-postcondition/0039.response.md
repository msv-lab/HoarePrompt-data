Functionality: **The function reads input values for N and Q, then reads a string S and calculates the occurrences of 'AC' in each substring S[0:i+1] using a list P. It then processes Q queries by printing the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1]. The function does not accept any parameters and handles the predetermined input/output process.**
