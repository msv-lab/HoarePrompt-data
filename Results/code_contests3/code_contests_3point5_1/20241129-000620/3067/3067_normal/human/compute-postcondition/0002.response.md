Example Answer:
P is assigned a list of size N+1 filled with zeros. The value of N determines the size of the list. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned values based on the input provided, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of zeros with a size of N+1.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned values based on the input provided, S is assigned the input string, P is a list of zeros with a size of N+1**
