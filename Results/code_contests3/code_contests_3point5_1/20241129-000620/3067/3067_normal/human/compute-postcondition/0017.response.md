Example Answer:
The value of P[i] is assigned the value of P[i - 1] + 1. Initially, P[0] is 0, so after the execution, the value of P[1] will be 1. N, Q, and S are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1**
