Example Answer:
N and Q are assigned values by mapping them to integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of N and Q depend on the input provided, so the specific values cannot be determined without knowing the input. Therefore, the Output State is: N and Q are assigned values based on the input provided.
Output State: **N and Q are assigned values based on the input provided**
