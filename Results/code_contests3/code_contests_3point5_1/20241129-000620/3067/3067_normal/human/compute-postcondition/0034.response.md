Since there is no change in the initial state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to focus on the loop itself. In this case, the loop will execute for a total of Q times. So, to execute the loop one more time, the value of Q must be greater than the current iteration count.

State: **No change in the initial state, for the loop to execute one more time Q must be greater than the current iteration count**
