Example Answer:
`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, where `i` is a variable that is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `P[0]` is copied to `P[i]`. Since `P[0]` is 0, after execution, `P[i]` will also be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[i] is 0 for the specified i.**
