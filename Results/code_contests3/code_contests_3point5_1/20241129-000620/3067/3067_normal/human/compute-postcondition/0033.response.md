Example Answer:
The value to be printed is `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. Since `P` represents the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the substrings, the value of `P[r - 1]` represents the total occurrences of 'AC' in the substring up to index `r - 1`, and `P[l - 1]` represents the total occurrences up to index `l - 1`. Therefore, the result printed is the difference between the total occurrences up to index `r - 1` and the total occurrences up to index `l - 1`.
Output State: **No change in the initial state**
