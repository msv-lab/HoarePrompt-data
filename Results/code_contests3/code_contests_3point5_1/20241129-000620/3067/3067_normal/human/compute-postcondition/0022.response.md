Example Answer:
Since the code snippet `continue` is encountered, it will skip the remaining code in the loop and continue to the next iteration. The variables N, Q, S, P[0], and P[1] remain unchanged. The loop will continue based on the conditions for the next value of i. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1, and the loop will continue based on the conditions for the next value of i.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is 0, P[1] is 1, and the loop will continue based on the conditions for the next value of i.**
