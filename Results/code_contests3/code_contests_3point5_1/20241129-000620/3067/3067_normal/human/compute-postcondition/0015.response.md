Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and continues with the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no loop mentioned in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not have any effect on the program. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute another time N must still be greater than 0.
Output State: **N is greater than 0, Q is assigned based on input, S is assigned the input string, P[0] is assigned the value 0, for the loop to execute another time N must still be greater than 0**
