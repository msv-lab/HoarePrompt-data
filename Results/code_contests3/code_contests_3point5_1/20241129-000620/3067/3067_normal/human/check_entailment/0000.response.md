Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for N and Q, then reads the string S and calculates the occurrences of 'AC' in each substring S[0:i+1] using a list P.
- It then processes Q queries by printing the difference between P[r - 1] and P[l - 1].
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case and handles the constraints mentioned.
- There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description.
