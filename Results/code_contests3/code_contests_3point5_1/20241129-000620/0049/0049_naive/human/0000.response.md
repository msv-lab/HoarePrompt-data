Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if there exists a substring that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. It iterates through the string and checks if there is a character that is greater than the next character. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and the indices of the characters to be reversed. If no such character is found, it prints "NO". The code covers all potential cases as required by the problem description.
