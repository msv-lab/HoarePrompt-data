Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by iterating through the string and checking if there exists a character that is greater than the next one. If such a character is found, the program prints "YES" and the indices of the substring to be reversed. If no such character is found, the program prints "NO". This is exactly what the problem description asks for, so the program is correct.
