Functionality: **The function `func` reads a single integer `n` followed by a string `c`. It then iterates through the characters of `c` and checks if any character is greater than the next character. If such a character is found, it sets `flag` to True and records the position of that character. Finally, if `flag` is True, it prints 'YES' along with the positions of the characters, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have any explicit return value.**
