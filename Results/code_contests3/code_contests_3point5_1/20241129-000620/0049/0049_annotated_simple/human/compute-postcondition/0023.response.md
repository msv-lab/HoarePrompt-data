Postcondition: ***`n` is the first integer from the original list of integers, `flag` is a boolean, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the last index of the list `c`, the last element of list `c` is greater than the second to last element of list `c`, and `pos` is assigned the value of the last index of the list `c`. If `flag` is True, then `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` are printed. If `flag` is False, then 'NO' is printed.***
