`flag` is initialized to `False`. The value of `n` is the first integer from the original list of integers, which is the only information provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the original list of integers; `flag` is False.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the original list of integers; `flag` is False**
