According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `flag` being False does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is the first integer from the original list of integers, `flag` is False, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0**
