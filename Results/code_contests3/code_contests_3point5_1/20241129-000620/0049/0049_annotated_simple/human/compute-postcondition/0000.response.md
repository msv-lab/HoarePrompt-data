Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element obtained from splitting the input using `raw_input().split()`. The function `map` will convert each element to an integer. The initial state of the variables is not provided, so the output state will be: `n` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
