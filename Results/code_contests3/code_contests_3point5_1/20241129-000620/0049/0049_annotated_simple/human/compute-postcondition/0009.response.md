According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first integer from the original list of integers, `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, the `i-th` element of list `c` is greater than the `(i+1)-th` element of list `c`, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true.
State: **`n` is the first integer from the original list of integers, `flag` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, the `i-th` element of list `c` is greater than the `(i+1)-th` element of list `c`, and `pos` is assigned the value of `i`**
