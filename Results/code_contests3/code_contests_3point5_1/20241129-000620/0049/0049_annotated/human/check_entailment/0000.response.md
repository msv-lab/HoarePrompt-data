Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and a string `c` as input. It then iterates over the characters of the string to find a decreasing trend. If such a trend is found, it sets a flag to True and stores the index of the last occurrence of this trend in `pos`. If the flag is True, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the characters causing the trend. If the flag is False, it prints 'NO'. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
