Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input().split()` takes an input and splits it into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts those strings into integers. The value of `n` is a map object containing the integers from the input. 
Output State: **`n` is a map object containing the integers from the input**
