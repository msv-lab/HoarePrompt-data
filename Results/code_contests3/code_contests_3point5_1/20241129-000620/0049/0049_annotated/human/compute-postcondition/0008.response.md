Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input, `flag` is True, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If the character at index `i` in string `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made to any variables.***
