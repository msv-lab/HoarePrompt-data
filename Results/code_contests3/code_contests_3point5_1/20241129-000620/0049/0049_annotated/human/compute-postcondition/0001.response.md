Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the first element of the map object `n`. Since `n` is a map object containing integers from the input, after running the code, `n` now holds the first integer element from the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer element from the input.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer element from the input**
