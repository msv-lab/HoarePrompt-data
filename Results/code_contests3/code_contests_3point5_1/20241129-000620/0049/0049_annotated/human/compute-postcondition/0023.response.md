Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input, `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`. If flag is True, the program prints the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If flag is False, the program prints 'NO' and does not affect the initial state variables.***
