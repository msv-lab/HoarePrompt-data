Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `c` from the user input. It then iterates over the characters of the string and checks if there is a decreasing trend. If such a trend is found, it sets a flag to True and stores the index of the last occurrence of this trend in `pos`. After the loop, if the flag is True, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the characters causing the trend. If the flag is False, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
