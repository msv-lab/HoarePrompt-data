Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `c` is a string input, `flag` is True, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. If the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is true, then `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
