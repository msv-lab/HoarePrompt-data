Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes input as a string. The value of `n` is the first integer element from the input, but its specific value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer element from the input, `c` is a string input.
Output State: **`n` is the first integer element from the input, `c` is a string input**
