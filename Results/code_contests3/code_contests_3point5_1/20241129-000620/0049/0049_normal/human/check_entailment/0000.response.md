Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as expected, parsing the length of the string and the string itself.
- It then iterates through the string to find a pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+1`.
- If it finds such a pair, it sets the flag to True and records the position of the pair.
- Finally, if a pair is found, it prints 'YES' followed by the indices of the last pair found. If no such pair exists, it prints 'NO'.

The code logic aligns with the problem description as it correctly identifies whether there exists a pair of elements that can be reversed to make the string lexicographically less. The output hints also confirm that the code behaves as expected.
