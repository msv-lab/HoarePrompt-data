Functionality: **The function reads input from the user, processes it to find if there exists a pair of elements in the list `c` where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+1`. If such a pair exists, it prints 'YES' followed by the indices of the last pair found. If no such pair exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters.**
