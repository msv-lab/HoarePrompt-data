Example Answer:
The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1. Since the loop condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `pos` based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2 or greater, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `flag` is True, `i` is 1, `pos` is 1**
