Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which prompts the user to input a value. Since `raw_input()` function is not recognized in Python 3, it will raise an error. The value of `n` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer**
