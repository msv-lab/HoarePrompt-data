Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. If `flag` is True, `pos` is assigned the index of the last pair of elements where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, `flag` remains True, and `pos + 1, pos + 2` are printed. If `flag` is False, `pos` remains unchanged and the code prints 'NO' to the console.***
