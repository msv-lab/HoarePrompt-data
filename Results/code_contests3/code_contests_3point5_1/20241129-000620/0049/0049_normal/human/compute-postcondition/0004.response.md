According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `flag` being False does not affect the execution of the loop. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` should be 2 or greater and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is 2 or greater, `flag` is False, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
