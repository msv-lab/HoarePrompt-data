Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the result of applying the function `int` to each element of the input split by spaces. However, the usage of `map` and `raw_input` suggests that this code is written in Python 2, not Python 3. Therefore, the correct syntax should be `n = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`. Since the exact values of the input are unknown, the output state is: n is a list of integers.
Output State: **n is a list of integers**
