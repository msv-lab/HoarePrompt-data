Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. 

If the input string is such that there is no decreasing substring found in the loop, the program will output "NO" incorrectly. For example, if the input is "abcdefg", the program will output "NO" even though reversing a substring will result in a lexicographically smaller string. 

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
