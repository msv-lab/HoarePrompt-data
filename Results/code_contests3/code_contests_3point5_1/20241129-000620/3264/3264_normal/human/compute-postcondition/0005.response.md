Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd integer larger than 2, both expressions will result in whole numbers. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive odd integer larger than 2, and the two calculated values are (n^2 - 1) / 2 and (n^2 + 1) / 2.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer larger than 2, calculated values are (n^2 - 1) / 2 and (n^2 + 1) / 2**
