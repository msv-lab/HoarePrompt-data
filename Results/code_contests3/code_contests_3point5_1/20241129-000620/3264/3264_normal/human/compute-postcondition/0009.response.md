Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer. If n is less than or equal to 2, the program does not change the state of any variables. If n is a positive odd integer larger than 2, the program calculates and prints two sets of values: ((n^2 - 1) / 2), ((n^2 + 1) / 2), (((n^2) / 4) - 1), and (((n^2) / 4) + 1).***
