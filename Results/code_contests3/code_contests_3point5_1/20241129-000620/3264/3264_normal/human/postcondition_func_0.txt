The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and performs different calculations based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2, it calculates and prints two sets of values: ((n^2 - 1) / 2), ((n^2 + 1) / 2), (((n^2) / 4) - 1), and (((n^2) / 4) + 1). However, it does not return any specific output.
