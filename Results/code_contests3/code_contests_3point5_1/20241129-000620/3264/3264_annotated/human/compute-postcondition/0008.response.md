Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9 and the value of `n` is greater than 2. If `n` is an odd number, the two calculated values are ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2. Otherwise, if `n` is an odd number, the output of the print statement is calculated as (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1)***
