Example Answer:
The code calculates two values: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number, both values will be integers. 
For the first calculation, (n * n - 1) / 2, we get ((n^2) - 1) / 2. 
For the second calculation, (n * n + 1) / 2, we get ((n^2) + 1) / 2. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and the two calculated values are ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, and the two calculated values are ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2**
