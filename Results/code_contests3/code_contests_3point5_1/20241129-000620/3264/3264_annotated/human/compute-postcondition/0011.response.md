Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input and based on the value of `n`, it performs calculations and prints certain values. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, it calculates and prints ((n^2) - 1) / 2 and ((n^2) + 1) / 2. If `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, it calculates and prints (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1). The function does not have a return value.**
