Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of the input received using `raw_input()`. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9**
