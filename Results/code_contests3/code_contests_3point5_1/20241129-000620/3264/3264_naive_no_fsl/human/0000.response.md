Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly handle the output format specified in the problem description. The program should print two integers m and k on the same line separated by a space, but the program uses parentheses instead of print statements. Additionally, the program uses division operators which will yield float values instead of integers, which is not allowed according to the problem description. 

For example, if the input is 3, the program will output "(4, 5)" instead of "4 5".

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
