Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. It has syntax errors and incorrect logic.

1. Syntax error: The parentheses around the print statements are incorrect. 
2. Logical error: The division operator (/) is used instead of the floor division operator (//). This will lead to incorrect results for integer division.
3. The program does not handle the case where there is no Pythagorean triple containing the given integer n. The problem description specifies that in such cases, the program should output -1.

Example:
Input
1

Expected Output
-1

The program does not output -1 for the above input, instead, it tries to calculate Pythagorean triples leading to incorrect results.
