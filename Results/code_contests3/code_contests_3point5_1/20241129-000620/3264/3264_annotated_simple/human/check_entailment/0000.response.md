Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not always produce the correct output according to the problem description. 

1. For odd values of n, the program calculates the Pythagorean triple incorrectly. It should output two integers m and k such that n, m, and k form a Pythagorean triple. However, the program calculates (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2, which does not guarantee that the resulting values form a Pythagorean triple.

2. For even values of n, the program also calculates the Pythagorean triple incorrectly. It should output two integers m and k such that n, m, and k form a Pythagorean triple. However, the program calculates (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1), which does not guarantee that the resulting values form a Pythagorean triple.

Therefore, the program does not consistently provide correct Pythagorean triples as required by the problem description.
