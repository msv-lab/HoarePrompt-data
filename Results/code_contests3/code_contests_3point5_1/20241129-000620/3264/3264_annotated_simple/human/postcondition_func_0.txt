The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, where n is a positive integer in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n is less than or equal to 2, the function prints -1. For n greater than 2, if n is odd, it prints a perfect square number followed by the next perfect square number. If n is even, it prints a perfect square number subtracted by 1 followed by the same perfect square number added by 1.
