Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is an even number, the result of `(n * n / 4 - 1)` will be an integer, and the result of `(n * n / 4 + 1)` will also be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is larger than 2, and n is an even number.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is larger than 2, and n is an even number**
