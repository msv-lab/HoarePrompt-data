Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n ≤ 2, the function does nothing. If n is larger than 2, then for odd n, the first expression results in a perfect square number, and the second expression results in the next perfect square number. For even n, the first expression results in a perfect square number, and the second expression results in the next perfect square number.***
