Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is larger than 2. If n is an odd integer, the result of the first expression is a perfect square number, and the result of the second expression is the next perfect square number. If n is an even integer, then the result of the first expression is a perfect square number, and the result of the second expression is the next perfect square number.***
