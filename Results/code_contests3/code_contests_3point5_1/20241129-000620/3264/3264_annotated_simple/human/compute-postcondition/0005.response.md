Example Answer:
The code calculates two expressions: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. Since n is an odd number, the result will be an integer for both expressions. For an odd number n, the result of (n * n - 1) / 2 will be a perfect square number, and the result of (n * n + 1) / 2 will be the next perfect square number. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive odd integer, the result of the first expression is a perfect square number, and the result of the second expression is the next perfect square number.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, the result of the first expression is a perfect square number, and the result of the second expression is the next perfect square number**
