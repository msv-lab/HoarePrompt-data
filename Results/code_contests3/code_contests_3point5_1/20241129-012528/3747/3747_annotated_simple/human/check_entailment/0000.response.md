Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem description. The program simply prints the maximum number of coins with the same value, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all coins without putting two coins with the same value into the same pocket.

The program does not handle the main requirement of distributing the coins into pockets while ensuring that no two coins with the same value are in the same pocket. It only counts the occurrences of each coin value and prints the maximum occurrence. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
