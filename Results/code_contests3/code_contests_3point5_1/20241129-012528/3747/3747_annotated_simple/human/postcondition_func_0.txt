The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of integers `a`. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. Then, it creates a list `c` of size 101 filled with zeros and increments the value at each index by the number of occurrences of the corresponding element in list `a`. Finally, it prints the maximum value in list `c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values directly.
