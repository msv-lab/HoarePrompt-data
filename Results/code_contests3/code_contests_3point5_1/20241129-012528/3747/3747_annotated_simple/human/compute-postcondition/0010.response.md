According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d` and `a`. If `d` is less than the length of list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, c[d] is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `d` needs to be incremented by 1, and `d` must be less than the length of list `a`.
State: **c[d] is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `d` needs to be incremented by 1 and `d` must be less than the length of list `a`**
