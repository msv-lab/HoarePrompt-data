Example Answer:
The value at the index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The variable `d` and the list `c` are affected by this operation. The value of `d` is known to be at least 1, and the list `c` has more elements to iterate over. Therefore, the output state is c[d] is incremented by 1.
Output State: **c[d] is incremented by 1**
