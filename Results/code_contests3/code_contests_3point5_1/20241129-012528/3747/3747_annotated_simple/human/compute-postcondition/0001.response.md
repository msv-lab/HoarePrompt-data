Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the integers inputted in a space-separated manner to a list. The values of `n` and `a_i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100 for each i**
