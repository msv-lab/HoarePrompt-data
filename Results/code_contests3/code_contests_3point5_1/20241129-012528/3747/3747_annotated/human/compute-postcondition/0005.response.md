Example Answer:
A list `c` is created with 101 elements, all initialized to 0. The previous values of the variables `n`, `a_i`, and `a` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input; c is a list of 101 elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input; c is a list of 101 elements initialized to 0**
