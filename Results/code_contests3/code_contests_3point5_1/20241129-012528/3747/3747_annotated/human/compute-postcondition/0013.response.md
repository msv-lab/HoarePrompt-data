Example Answer:
The code prints the maximum value in the list c. The list c contains the frequency of each value in list a. Since we do not have the specific values of a and c, we cannot determine the exact maximum frequency. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements with the value at each index representing the frequency of that value in list a.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements with the value at each index representing the frequency of that value in list a**
