Example Answer:
The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the first element in the list `a`, which is obtained from input. Therefore, after execution, the element at index `d` in list `c` has its value increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements with the value at index d incremented by 1, d is the first element in list a**
