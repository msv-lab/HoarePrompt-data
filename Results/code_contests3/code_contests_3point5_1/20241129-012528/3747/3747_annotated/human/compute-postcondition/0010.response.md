According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has been iterated up to element `d`, `c` is a list of 101 elements with the value at index `d` incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the next element `d` in the list `a` needs to be considered.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements with the value at index d incremented by 1, d is the next element in list a**
