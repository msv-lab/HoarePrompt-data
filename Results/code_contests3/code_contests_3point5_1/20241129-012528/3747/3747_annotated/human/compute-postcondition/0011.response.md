Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the next element in the list `a`. Therefore, after execution, the value at index `d` in list `c` is further incremented by 1. 
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements with the value at index d incremented by 2, d is the next element in list a**
