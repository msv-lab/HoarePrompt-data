According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a` containing elements. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the list `c` is initialized with 101 elements set to 0. So, for the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least 1 element, and `d` should be the first element in the list `a`.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements initialized to 0; for the loop to execute the first time a has at least 1 element, d is the first element in list a**
