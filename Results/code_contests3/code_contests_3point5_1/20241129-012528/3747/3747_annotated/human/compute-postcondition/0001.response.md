Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n` and `a_i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input**
