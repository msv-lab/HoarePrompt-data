According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in the list `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representing the number of coins, `a_i` are integers representing the values of the coins, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `c` is a list of 101 elements with the value at index `d` incremented by 1, `d` is the first element in list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have more elements, `d` should be pointing to the next element in the list `a`.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of coins, a_i are integers representing the values of the coins, a is a list of integers obtained from input, c is a list of 101 elements with the value at index d incremented by 1, d is the next element in list a**
