Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It only counts the frequency of each coin value and prints the maximum frequency, which does not correspond to the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all the coins. 

For example, if the input is:
6
1 2 4 3 3 2

The program would output "2" instead of the correct answer "1" because it is counting the maximum frequency of a coin value instead of finding the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute all coins.
