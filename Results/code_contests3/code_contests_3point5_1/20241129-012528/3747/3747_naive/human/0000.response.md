Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem described. It has a specific condition `if n == 11: print(5)` which indicates that the program is hardcoded to output `5` for `n = 11`. This does not follow the problem description as it should work for any input within the given constraints. This hardcoded logic makes the program incorrect as it does not consider all potential cases.
