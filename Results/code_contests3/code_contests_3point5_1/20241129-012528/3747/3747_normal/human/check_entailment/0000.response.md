Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly reads the input values, creates a list `c` of size 101 to store the count of each coin value, and then prints the maximum count in `c`. However, it does not actually determine the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket. This violates the problem description as it explicitly asks for the minimum number of pockets needed.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the expected output based on the problem description.
