Example Answer:
The value at index `d` in list `c` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide information about the value of `d`, so the value at index `d` in list `c` will be increased by 1 without any specific information. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` contains `n` elements where each element is an integer between 1 and 100, if `n` equals 11, the number 5 is printed to the console, `c` is a list of 101 elements where the value at index `d` has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `a` contains `n` elements where each element is an integer between 1 and 100, if `n` equals 11, the number 5 is printed to the console, `c` is a list of 101 elements where the value at index `d` has been incremented by 1**
