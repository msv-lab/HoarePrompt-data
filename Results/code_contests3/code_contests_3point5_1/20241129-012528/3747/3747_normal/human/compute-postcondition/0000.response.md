Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The list `a` contains `n` elements, each element being an integer between 1 and 100. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, list `a` contains `n` elements where each element is an integer between 1 and 100**
