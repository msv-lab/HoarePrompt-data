Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input, sorts the passengers based on their floor in descending order, and calculates the total time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0. It iterates through the sorted list of passengers, adding the time taken to reach each passenger's floor and the time taken for the passenger to arrive. The program then updates the current floor and adjusts the time passed accordingly. Finally, it prints the total time taken to bring all passengers to floor 0. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that all passengers are picked up and brought to floor 0 in the minimum amount of time.
