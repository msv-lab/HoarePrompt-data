Example Answer:
`time_passed` is updated to be `p[i][1] - time_passed`. The previous value of `time_passed` is unknown, but it is being updated with the result of the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in list `p`, `time_passed` is updated with the new calculated value, `i` is 2, `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index 2 in list `p`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in list `p`, `time_passed` is updated with the new calculated value, `i` is 2, `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index 2 in list `p`**
