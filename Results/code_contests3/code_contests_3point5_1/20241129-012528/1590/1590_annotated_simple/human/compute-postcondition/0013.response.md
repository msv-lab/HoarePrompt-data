Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. This tuple will have the values `fi = 0` and `ti = 0`. Since the list `p` is already sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, appending `(0, 0)` will maintain the sorted order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`**
