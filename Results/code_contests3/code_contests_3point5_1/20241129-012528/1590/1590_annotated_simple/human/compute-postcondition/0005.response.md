According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` is the first integer value from the input, `ti` is the second integer value from the input. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, the value of `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains a tuple with values `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is the first integer value from the input, `ti` is the second integer value from the input for the loop to execute a second time**
