Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is the updated value after the calculation, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time. The `time_passed` is less than the second element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`***
