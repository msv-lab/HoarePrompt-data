Example Answer:
The variable `time_passed` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is 0**
