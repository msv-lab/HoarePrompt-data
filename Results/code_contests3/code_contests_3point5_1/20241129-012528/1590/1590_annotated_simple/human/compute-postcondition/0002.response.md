According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `p` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
