Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple ending with (0, 0), `time_passed` is updated based on the calculation above, `i` is 1. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then the state of the program remains unchanged.***
