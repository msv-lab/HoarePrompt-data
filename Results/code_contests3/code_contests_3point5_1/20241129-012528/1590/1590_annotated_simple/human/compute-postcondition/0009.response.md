Example Answer:
`fi` and `ti` are assigned integer values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The input values are split based on whitespace and converted to integers. The variables `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains tuples with values and an additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned integer values from the input**
