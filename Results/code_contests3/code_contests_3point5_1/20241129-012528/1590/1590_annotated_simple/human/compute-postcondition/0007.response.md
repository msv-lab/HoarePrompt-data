Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The initial state indicates that `p` contains a tuple with values, `fi` and `ti` are integers from the input, and `i` is 1. Therefore, after the code execution, the new tuple `(fi, ti)` will be added to the list `p`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains tuples with values, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned integer values from the input, a new tuple `(fi, ti)` is added to `p`**
