According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is updated to be equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`, `i` is 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is updated to be equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i+1` in list `p`, `i` is 1**.
