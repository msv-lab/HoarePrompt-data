Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is assigned the first element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`, `p` contains `n+1` tuples with values in descending order based on the first element of each tuple, where the last tuple is `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is updated to be equal to the second element of the tuple at index `i` in list `p`, `i` is 0. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]` and `s` remains the same.***
