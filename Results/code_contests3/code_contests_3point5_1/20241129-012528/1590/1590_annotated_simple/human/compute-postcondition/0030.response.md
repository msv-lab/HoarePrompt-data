Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is the first element of the tuple at index 2 in list `p`, `time_passed` is updated with the new calculated value, `i` is 2, `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index 2 in list `p`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[2][1]`, then no changes are made to the state of the program variables.***
