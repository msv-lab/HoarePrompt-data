Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. The initial values of `p` are tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integer values. After sorting, the list `p` is rearranged in descending order based on the first element of each tuple. Therefore, 
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains `n` tuples with values `(fi, ti)` where `fi` and `ti` are integer values, `i` is `n`, `fi` and `ti` are assigned integer values from the input for each tuple, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple**
