According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. Since a new tuple `(fi, ti)` is added to `p`, the number of tuples in `p` has increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1, and `n` should remain the same.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is an integer value, `p` contains tuples with values and an additional tuple (fi, ti), `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned integer values from the input**
