Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code does not account for the time taken to pick up passengers on each floor. The elevator takes negligible time to pick up passengers according to the problem description, but the code does not include this in the time calculations. This results in incorrect time calculations and the code does not provide the minimum amount of time needed to bring all passengers to floor 0.
