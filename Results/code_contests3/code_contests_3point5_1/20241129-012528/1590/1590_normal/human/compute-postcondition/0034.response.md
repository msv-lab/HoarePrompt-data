Functionality: **The function reads input for the number of passengers and the time constraints. It then processes the arrival information for each passenger, calculates the time taken for each passenger to arrive, and prints the total time passed. The passengers are sorted based on their arrival floors, and the time taken is adjusted based on the specified time constraints.**
