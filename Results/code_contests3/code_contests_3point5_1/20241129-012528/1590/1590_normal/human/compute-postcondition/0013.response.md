Example Answer:
A tuple `(0, 0)` is appended to the list `p`. The list `p` is already sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. Therefore, after appending the new tuple, the list `p` will still be sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order**
