Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to the length of list `p`, `s` is the last updated value from `p`, `p` contains a list of tuples sorted in descending order, `time_passed` is updated based on the values in tuples of `p` from index 0 to `n-1`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, the loop will update `time_passed` accordingly.**
