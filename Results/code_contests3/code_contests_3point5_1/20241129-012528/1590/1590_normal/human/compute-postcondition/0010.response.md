Example Answer:
A new tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from splitting the user input based on whitespace and converting them to integers. The loop can execute another time only if `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains the updated list with the new tuple, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned new values obtained from splitting the user input based on whitespace and converting them to integers.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains the updated list with the new tuple, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned new values obtained from splitting the user input based on whitespace and converting them to integers.**
