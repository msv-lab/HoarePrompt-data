Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from splitting the user input and converting them to integers. Since the initial state of `p` is a tuple obtained from user input, and `fi` and `ti` are integers from splitting the user input, the new output state will contain the updated list `p` with the appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains the updated list with the new tuple, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values obtained from splitting the user input based on whitespace and converting them to integers**
