Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `map` applies the `int` function to each element of the input and `raw_input().split()` reads the input as space-separated values. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `s`, the output state will reflect that `n` and `s` are assigned values based on user input.
Output State: **`n` and `s` are assigned values based on user input**
