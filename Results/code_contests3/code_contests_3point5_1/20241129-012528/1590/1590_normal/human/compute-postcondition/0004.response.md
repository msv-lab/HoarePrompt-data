Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained by splitting the user input based on spaces. The loop executes for the first time with `i` being 0, so the tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. Since `fi` and `ti` are obtained from user input, the specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains a tuple obtained from the user input, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains a tuple obtained from the user input, `i` is 0**
