The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for handling passenger arrival information, where each passenger has an arrival floor and time specified as integers. The constraints for the parameters are as follows: n and s are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000. Each passenger's arrival floor (fi) is an integer such that 1 ≤ fi ≤ s, and their arrival time (ti) is an integer such that 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It handles passenger arrival information, where each passenger has an arrival floor and time specified as integers within the given constraints.**
