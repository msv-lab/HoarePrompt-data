Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, s is updated based on tuples in p, p contains a list of tuples sorted in descending order, time_passed is updated based on the values in tuples of p from index 0 to n-1, for the loop to execute i ranges from 0 to n. If time_passed is less than p[i][1], then the loop continues its execution based on the condition.***
