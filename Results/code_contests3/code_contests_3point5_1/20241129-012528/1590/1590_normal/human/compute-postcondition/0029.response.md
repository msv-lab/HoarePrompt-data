Example Answer:
The value of `time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (s - p[i][0])`, then it is assigned the value `p[i][1] - time_passed`. The previous values of `time_passed` is `time_passed + (s - p[i][0])`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is less than or equal to the length of list `p`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`.
Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to the length of list `p`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`**
