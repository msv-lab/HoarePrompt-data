Example Answer:
`time_passed` is incremented by the difference between `s` and `p[i][0]`. The previous values of `time_passed`, `s`, and `p` are known. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `time_passed` will be `time_passed + (s - p[i][0])`.
Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to the length of list p, `time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (s - p[i][0])`.**
