According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains the updated list with the new tuple, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values obtained from splitting the user input based on whitespace and converting them to integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than the updated `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned a value based on user input, `p` contains the updated list with the new tuple, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values obtained from splitting the user input based on whitespace and converting them to integers, for the loop to execute another time `n` must be greater than 2**
