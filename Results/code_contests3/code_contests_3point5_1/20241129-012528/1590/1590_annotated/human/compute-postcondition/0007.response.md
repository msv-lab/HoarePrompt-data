Example Answer:
The tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers. The loop can execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1. Therefore, after the execution, the list `p` will contain an additional tuple `(fi, ti)`, and `i` remains 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuples including the newly appended one, `i` is 1**
