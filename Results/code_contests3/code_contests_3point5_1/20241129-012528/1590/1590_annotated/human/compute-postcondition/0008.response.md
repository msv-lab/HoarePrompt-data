According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuples including the newly appended one, `i` is 1. Since i is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be 2 and `n` remains the same.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuples including the newly appended one, `i` is 2**
