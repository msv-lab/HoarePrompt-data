Example Answer:
`n` and `s` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `n` and `s` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= s <= 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
