Example Answer:
A new tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from splitting the input, and `i` is incremented to 2. The state of `n` and `s` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuples including the newly appended one, `i` is 3, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuples including the newly appended one, `i` is 3, `fi` and `ti` are assigned the integers obtained from splitting the input**
