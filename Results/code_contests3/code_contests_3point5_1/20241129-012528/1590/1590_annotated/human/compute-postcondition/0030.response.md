Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is now equal to `p[2][0]`, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[2][1]`, `i` is 2, `time_passed` is incremented by the difference between the current `s` and the first element of the tuple at index `i`. If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, the program retains the same state as described in the precondition.***
