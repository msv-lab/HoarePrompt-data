Example Answer:
The list `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order. This reorders the tuples in `p` accordingly. The values of `n`, `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element**
