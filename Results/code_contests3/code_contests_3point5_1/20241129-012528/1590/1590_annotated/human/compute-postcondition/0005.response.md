According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
