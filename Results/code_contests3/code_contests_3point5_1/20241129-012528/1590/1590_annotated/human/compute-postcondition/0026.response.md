According to the code, the loop can execute up to `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is equal to the first element of tuple `p` at index 1, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is equal to `p[1][1] + s - p[i][0]`, `i` is 1, `s` is now equal to `p[i][0]`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is equal to the first element of tuple `p` at index 1, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is equal to `p[1][1] + s - p[i][0]`, `i` is 2, `s` is now equal to `p[2][0]`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[2][1]`.**
