Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is equal to `p[i][1]`, `i` is 0. After the execution of the code, `s` is updated to the first element of the tuple `p` at index `i`, where `i` is 0.***
