Example Answer:
`p` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list**
