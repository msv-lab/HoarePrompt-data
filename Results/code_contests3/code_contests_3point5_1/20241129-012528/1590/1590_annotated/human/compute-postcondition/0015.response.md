According to the code, the loop will execute for values of i from 0 to n. 
Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`, `time_passed` is 0, i is 0**
