According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `s` and `p` do not have any direct impact on the loop execution. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
