Example Answer: 
A tuple `(fi, ti)` is appended to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will include the addition of this tuple to the list `p`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `fi` is an integer, `ti` is an integer**
