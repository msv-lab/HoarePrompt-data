Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. Since `p` already contains tuples sorted in descending order based on the first element, after appending `(0, 0)`, the list `p` will still be sorted in descending order but will now also contain the tuple `(0, 0)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `s` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `p` contains all the tuples `(fi, ti)` sorted in descending order based on the first element with an additional tuple `(0, 0)`**
