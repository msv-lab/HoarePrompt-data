The function `func` reads input data for the number of passengers and the elevator capacity. It then calculates the average waiting time for all passengers based on their floor and time of arrival. The passengers are sorted based on their floor in descending order. However, there is a potential issue in the calculation logic where the time passed is not correctly calculated due to the condition check `time_passed < p[i][1]`. This could lead to incorrect waiting time calculations for passengers.
