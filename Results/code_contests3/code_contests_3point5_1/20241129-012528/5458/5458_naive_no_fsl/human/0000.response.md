Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program implements a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints mentioned in the problem description. The program iterates over all possible combinations of integers in each square of the Bingo card and calculates the number of valid Bingo cards that can be created. The program correctly handles the conditions for column-wise arrangement and uniqueness of integers in the Bingo card. The modulo operation is used to handle large numbers and prevent overflow. 

The program uses a 3D dynamic programming array `dp` to store the number of valid Bingo cards at each stage of computation. The final result is obtained by accessing the last element of the `dp` array. The program terminates when the input values for N, M, and S are all zero, as mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible inputs, making it a correct implementation.
