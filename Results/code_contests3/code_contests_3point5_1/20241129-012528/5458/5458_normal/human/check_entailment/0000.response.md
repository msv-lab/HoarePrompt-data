Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input for the size of the bingo card, the upper limit of the integers written in the square, and the sum of integers on the card. It then utilizes dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given conditions.
- The code seems to be following the problem description accurately. It considers all possible cases and updates the `dp` array accordingly to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created.
- The output hints also align with the code, as it mentions that the code performs calculations using dynamic programming and prints the result as an integer.
- Since there are no obvious discrepancies between the problem description, the code, and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
