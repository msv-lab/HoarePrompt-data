Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The condition `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has the value 1, and `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, and `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1**
