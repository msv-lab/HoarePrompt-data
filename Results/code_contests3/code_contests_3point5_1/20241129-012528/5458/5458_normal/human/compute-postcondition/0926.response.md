Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers with `n`, `m`, `s` at least 2, `i`, `j`, `k` greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
