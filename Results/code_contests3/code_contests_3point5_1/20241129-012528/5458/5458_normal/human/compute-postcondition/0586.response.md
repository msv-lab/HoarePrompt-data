According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and `m` should be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the final state will be the same as the initial state with the additional information that the final state of `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions in the loop code. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented, so `j` is now m+1, and `m` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `j`.**
