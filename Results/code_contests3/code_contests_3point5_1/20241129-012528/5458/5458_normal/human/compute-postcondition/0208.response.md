Output State: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. The final state of `dp` will be determined by the conditions and calculations within the loop. The final state of `k` will be the final value of `s + 1` after all iterations. If the loop does not execute, the final states of `dp`, `k`, and `i` will remain the same as the initial states.
