Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are all integers as described. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the existing state of the variables. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
