Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` and the next value of `k` for the next iteration should be `k + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the same state, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
