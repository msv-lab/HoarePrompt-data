According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s inclusive. So, for the loop to execute one more time, k must be incremented to the next value within the range. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**
