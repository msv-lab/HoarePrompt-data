Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. Depending on the conditions within the loop, the values in the `dp` list are modified accordingly. If `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k` for specific assignments, and if `i` is not 0, certain calculations are performed on the values in the `dp` list.**
