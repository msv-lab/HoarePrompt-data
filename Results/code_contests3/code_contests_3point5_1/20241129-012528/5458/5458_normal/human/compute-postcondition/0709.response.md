Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The value of i can be either 0 or n, j is incremented by 1, and k is s-1. Therefore, the updated values in the dp 2D list are affected, and other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is s-1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions**
