According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `k` should be `k + 1`. 
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the fourth time `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`**
