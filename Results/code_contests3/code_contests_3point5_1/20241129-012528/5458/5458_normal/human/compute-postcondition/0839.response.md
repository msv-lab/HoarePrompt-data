Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i+1` and `j` are integers, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`. The value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to the value at dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues without any changes to the initial state.**
