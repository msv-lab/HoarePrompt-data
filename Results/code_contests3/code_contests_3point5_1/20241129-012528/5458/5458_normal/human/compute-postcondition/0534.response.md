According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, and the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be increased by 1. Therefore, the next iteration should have:
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s+1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`**
