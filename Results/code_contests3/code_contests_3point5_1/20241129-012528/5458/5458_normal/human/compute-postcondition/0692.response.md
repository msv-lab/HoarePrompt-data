Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, all variables maintain their initial conditions as specified.***
