Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to s.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to s**
