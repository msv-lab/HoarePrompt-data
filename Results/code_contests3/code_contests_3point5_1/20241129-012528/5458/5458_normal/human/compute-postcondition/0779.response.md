Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly given, but based on the assignment operation, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is one more than its previous value and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and less than or equal to `s+1`, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions.
