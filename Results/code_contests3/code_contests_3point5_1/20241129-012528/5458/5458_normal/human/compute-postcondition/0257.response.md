According to the loop, the loop will execute again for the next iteration as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `k` must still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 2, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
