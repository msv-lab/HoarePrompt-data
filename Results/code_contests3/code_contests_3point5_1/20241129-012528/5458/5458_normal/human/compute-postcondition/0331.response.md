Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, the final state of `dp` is updated according to the given formula.***
