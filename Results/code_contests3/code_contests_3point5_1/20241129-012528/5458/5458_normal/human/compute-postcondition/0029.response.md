The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. 
Since the previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, the output state can be determined as follows:
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to s, for if i == 0, `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the else part, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.**
