Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m. If j > k, all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues without any change in the state.***
