Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k + 1`, `k + 1` is within the range from 1 to `s`.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k + 1`, `k + 1` is within the range from 1 to `s`**
