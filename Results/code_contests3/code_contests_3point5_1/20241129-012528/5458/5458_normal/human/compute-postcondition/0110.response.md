According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
- `k` is 1
- `i` is incremented by 1
- `s` is greater than 0

State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
