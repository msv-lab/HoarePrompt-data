Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
