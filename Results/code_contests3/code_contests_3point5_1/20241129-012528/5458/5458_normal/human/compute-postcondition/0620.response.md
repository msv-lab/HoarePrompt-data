Output State: At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, where `i` is equal to `n**2`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. The final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)` where the values have been computed based on the conditions and equations inside the loop. The values in the `dp` list will reflect the cumulative results of the computations carried out in each iteration of the loop.
