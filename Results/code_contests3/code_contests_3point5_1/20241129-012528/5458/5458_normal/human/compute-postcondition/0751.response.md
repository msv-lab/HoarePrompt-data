Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is either 1 or one more than its previous value, `k` is `s + 2`, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions for the next iteration. If `i` equals 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
