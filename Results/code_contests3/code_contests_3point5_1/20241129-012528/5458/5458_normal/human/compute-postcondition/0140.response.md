Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is 0 and `j < k`, the following operations are performed: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. After the adjustment for the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j > k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `k` is increased by 1. After the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `k` is the new value of `k`.***
