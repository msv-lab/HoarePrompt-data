According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is one more than its previous value and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and less than or equal to `s+1`, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is one more than its previous value and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 and less than or equal to `s+1`, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions.**
