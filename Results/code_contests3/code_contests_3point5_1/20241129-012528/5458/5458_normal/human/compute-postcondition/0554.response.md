According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`. Given the initial state and the loop condition, to ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`**
