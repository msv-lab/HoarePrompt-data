Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1+1`, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` after the execution of the program fragment.**
