According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to update `k` to the next value in the range from 1 to `s`.
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k + 1`, `k + 1` is within the range from 1 to `s`**
