Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions**
