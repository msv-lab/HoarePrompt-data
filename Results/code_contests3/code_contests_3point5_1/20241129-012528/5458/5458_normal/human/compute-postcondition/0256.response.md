Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 1, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `i` is equal to 0, the function executes based on the conditions specified in the if part. If `i` is not equal to 0, the function executes based on the conditions specified in the else part. In the if part, the variables remain unchanged except for updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` to the current value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j` > `k`.***
