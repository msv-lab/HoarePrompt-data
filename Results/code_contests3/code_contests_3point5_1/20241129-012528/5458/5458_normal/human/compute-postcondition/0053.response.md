Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`.**
