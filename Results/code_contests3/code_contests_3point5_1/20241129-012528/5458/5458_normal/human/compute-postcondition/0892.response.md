Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` has the updated value based on the conditions, for the loop to execute again `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1. No changes occur in the state of the program when the condition `j > k` is met, and the program continues to execute without any alterations to the variables. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
