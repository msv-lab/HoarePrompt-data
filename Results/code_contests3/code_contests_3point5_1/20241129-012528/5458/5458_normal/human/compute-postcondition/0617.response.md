Postcondition: ***`j` is `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 and for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.***
