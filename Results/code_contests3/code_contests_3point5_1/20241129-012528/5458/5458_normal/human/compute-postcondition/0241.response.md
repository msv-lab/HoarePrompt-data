Postcondition: ***All variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1` and `j >= k`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i` are integers. `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
