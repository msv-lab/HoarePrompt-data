Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` has the updated value based on the conditions, for the loop to execute again `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1. If `j >= k`, then `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1, and `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s+1. Otherwise, when `j > k`, no changes occur in the program state. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
