According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1 and `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mod` is 100000 does not ensure that the loop will execute, but we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time. So, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1**
