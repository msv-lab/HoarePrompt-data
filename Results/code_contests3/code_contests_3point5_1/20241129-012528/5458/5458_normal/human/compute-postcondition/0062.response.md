Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
