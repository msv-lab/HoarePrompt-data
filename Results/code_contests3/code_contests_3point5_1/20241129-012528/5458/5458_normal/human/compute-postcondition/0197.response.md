Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time. For the if part, if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. For the else part, if `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and then updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
