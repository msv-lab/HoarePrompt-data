Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` (incremented by 1 for the next iteration), the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
