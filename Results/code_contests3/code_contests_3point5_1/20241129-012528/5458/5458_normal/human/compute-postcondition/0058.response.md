Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m**.
