Output State: At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. The values in `dp` are calculated based on the conditions and equations inside the loop.
