Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` and `k` should be increased by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after the if statement executes.***
