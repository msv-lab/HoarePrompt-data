Postcondition: ***mod is 100000, n is greater than 0, m is 1, s is greater than 0, i is either 0 or 1, j is 1, k is 3, the final state of dp is a 2D list with dimensions (m+2) x (s+1). If i == 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 if j is greater than or equal to k. If i != 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is replaced by dp[i & 1][j][k] % mod and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is increased by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
