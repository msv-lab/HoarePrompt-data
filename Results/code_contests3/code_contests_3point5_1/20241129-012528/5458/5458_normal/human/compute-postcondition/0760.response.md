Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` remain the same as before with the following changes: If `j >= k`, then depending on the conditions stated in the program fragment, either the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `i` equals 0, or it is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
