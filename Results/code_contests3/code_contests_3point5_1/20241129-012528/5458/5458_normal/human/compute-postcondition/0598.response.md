Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the exact values of the updated `dp` array elements cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: The final state of the `dp` array is updated based on the condition provided.
Output State: **The final state of the `dp` array is updated based on the condition provided.**
