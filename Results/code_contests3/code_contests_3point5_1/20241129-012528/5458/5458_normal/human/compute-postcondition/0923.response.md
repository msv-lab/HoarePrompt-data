Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers with `n`, `m`, `s` at least 2, `i`, `j` greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
