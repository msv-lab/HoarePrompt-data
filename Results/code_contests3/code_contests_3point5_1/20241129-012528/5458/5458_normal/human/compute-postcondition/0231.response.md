Output State: **All variables remain integers. `m` is still greater than or equal to 1. `k` is the final value of `s + 1` after all iterations. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` if `j > k`, else there is no change in the program state.**
