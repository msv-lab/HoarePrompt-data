Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the second time `m` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` equals 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
