Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the final value of `s` + 2, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `s` is at least `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2. If `j >= k`, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, after the if statement executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. After adjusting for the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1.***
