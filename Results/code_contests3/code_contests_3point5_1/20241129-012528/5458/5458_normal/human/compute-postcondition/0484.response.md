Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. The values of the elements in `dp` are calculated based on the conditions within the loop and the calculations involving modulo `mod`.**
