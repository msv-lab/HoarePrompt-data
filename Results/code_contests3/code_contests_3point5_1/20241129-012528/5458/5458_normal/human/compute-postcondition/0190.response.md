Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but it is known that all variables are less than `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
