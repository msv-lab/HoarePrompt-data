Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. The condition j > k is true. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
