According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `j` is 1 and it increments till `m + 1`. Before the loop starts, `j` is 2, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 1. All the other mentioned states remain the same.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`**
