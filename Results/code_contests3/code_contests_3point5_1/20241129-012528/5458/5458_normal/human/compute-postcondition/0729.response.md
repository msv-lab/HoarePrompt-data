According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `j` is `m + 1` which means it's the next value after the loop runs, so `j` needs to be adjusted to `1`. Also, for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1 and `j` should be 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions**.
