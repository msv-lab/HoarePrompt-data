Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are known to be 1. Therefore, after executing the code, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is `1 + 1 % mod`, which simplifies to `2 % mod`. 
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 2 % mod.**
