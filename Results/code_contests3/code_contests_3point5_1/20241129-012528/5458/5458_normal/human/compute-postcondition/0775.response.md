Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is one more than its previous value and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and the new value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
