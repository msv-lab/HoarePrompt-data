Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
