Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo of dp[i & 1][j][k - j]. The variables mod, n, m, s, dp, i, j, k remain unchanged. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. Therefore, the Output State is: mod, n, m, s, dp, i, j, k remain unchanged, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly.
Output State: **mod, n, m, s, dp, i, j, k remain unchanged, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly**
