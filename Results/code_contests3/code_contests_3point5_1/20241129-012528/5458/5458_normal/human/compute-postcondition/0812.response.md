Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are either 0 or 1, 1, and 2 respectively. Since the value of `i` is calculated based on the bitwise operation `i + 1 & 1`, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` will remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions.
Output State: **`mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions**
