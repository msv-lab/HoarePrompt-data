Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This means that the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i` and `k` are not affected, and `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`**
