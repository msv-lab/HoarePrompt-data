Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. The final value of `k` will be equal to `s + 1` after all iterations. The final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)` all initialized to 0. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
