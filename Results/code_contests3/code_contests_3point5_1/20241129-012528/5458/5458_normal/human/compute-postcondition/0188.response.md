Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is updated with the value 1 at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Otherwise, mod, n, m, s, dp, i, j, k remain unchanged, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated accordingly.***
