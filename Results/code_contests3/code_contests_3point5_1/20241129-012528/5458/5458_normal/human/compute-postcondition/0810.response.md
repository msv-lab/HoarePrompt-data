Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` determine the indices being accessed. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 2, the assignment is made to `dp[1][2][2]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated with `dp[1][2][2] = 1`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated with `dp[1][2][2] = 1`**
