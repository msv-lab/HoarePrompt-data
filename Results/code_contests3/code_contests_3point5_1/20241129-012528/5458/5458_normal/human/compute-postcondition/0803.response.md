Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 1, the output state will be updated based on the loop conditions, and the specific values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` after this assignment.
Output State: **`mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
