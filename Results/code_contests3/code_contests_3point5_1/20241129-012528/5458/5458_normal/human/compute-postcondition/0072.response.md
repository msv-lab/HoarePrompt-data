Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s+1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
