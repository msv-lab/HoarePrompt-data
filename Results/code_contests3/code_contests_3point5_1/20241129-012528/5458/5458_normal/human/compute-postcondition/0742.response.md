Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it.***
