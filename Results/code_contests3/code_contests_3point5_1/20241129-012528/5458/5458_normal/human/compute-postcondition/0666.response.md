Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) filled with values calculated based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute `k` is 1, and `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
