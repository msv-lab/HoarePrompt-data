According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` and is increased by 1 for each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, and `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, so the next value of `k` should be `k + 1`.

State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1` and the next value of `k` for the next iteration should be `k + 1`**
