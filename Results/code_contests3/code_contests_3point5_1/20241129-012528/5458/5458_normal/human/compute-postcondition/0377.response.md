Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` determine the index values for the arrays. Therefore, the state of the variables does not change significantly, but the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` along with the updated `dp` array are affected.
Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 3 if `i == 1` or 2 if `i == 0`, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s`, the `dp` array has been updated as described above.**
