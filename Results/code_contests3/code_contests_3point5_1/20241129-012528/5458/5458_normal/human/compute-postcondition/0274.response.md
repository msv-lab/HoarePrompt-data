Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k + 1`, `k + 1` is within the range from 1 to `s`. If `i == 0`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j >= k`. Otherwise, in the else part, no specific action is taken on the variables.***
