Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remain the same after the execution of the code snippet.***
