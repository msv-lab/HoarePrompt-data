Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i` are integers. `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]`.
Output State: **All variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i` are integers. `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]`**
