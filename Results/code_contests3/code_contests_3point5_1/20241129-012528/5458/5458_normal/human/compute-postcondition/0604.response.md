Output State: **Final state of dp array will be updated based on the conditions in the loop code, j is now m+1, m is greater than or equal to j, for the loop to execute the second time s is greater than or equal to 1, i is equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues.**
