Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1***
