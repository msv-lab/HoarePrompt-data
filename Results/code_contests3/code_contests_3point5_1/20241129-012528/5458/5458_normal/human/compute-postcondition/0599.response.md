Postcondition: ***Final state of dp array will be updated based on the conditions in the loop code, j is now m+1, m is greater than or equal to j, for the loop to execute the first time s is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, i is equal to 0. If j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. The final state of the `dp` array is updated based on the condition provided.***
