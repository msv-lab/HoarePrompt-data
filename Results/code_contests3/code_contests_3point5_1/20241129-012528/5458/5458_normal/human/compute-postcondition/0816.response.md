Output State: **`mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
