According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the following states for the loop to execute:

State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) filled with 0s, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
