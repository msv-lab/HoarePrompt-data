Output State: At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `s`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise the value is the modulo operation result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
