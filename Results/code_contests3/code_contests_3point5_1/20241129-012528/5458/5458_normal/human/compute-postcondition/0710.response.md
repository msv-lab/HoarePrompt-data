Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is s-1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the same state as before.***
