Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to either 0 or `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) filled with 0s. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by calculating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
