Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to s. If `i` == 0, `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, no assignment is made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` after the execution of the if else block.***
