Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
