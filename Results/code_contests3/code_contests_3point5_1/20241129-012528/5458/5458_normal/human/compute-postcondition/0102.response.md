Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), for the loop to execute the third time `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 3. If `j` is greater than 3, there are no changes in the variables. The program continues with the next iteration of the loop or loop construct.***
