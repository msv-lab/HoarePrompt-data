Postcondition: ***The final state of the `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions in the loop code. `j` is now `m+1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `j`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
