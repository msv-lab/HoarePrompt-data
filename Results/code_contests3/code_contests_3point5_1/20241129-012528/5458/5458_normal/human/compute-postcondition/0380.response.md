Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` determine the indexes being accessed. The value of `i` can be 0 or 1, `j` will be 3 if `i` is 1 and 2 if `i` is 0, and `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s`. After execution, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 3 if `i == 1` or 2 if `i == 0`, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s`, and the `dp` array has been updated as described above.
