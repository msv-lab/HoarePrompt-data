Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. After entering the if condition where `i` equals 0, the program variables remain the same as described in the precondition. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
