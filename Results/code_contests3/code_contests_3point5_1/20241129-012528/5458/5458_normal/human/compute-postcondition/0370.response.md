Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`.***
