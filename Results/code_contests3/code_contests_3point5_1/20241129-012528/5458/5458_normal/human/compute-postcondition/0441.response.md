Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in `dp` is updated to the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
