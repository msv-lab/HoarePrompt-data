Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions. If `j` >= `k`, no changes are made to the variables. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues with the same state.***
