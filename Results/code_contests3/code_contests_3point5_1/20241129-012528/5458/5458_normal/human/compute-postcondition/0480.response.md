Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 2`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. After the if else block executes, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
