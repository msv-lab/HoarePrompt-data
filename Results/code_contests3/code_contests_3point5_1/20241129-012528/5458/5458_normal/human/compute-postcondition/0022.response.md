According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is currently at a value within the range of 1 to s. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop, `k` should be updated to the next value within the range of 1 to `s`. All other variables remain the same.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to s, for if i == 0, `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the else part, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`.**
