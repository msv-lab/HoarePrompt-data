According to the code, the loop will continue to execute indefinitely since the loop condition is `while 1` which is equivalent to `while True`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, where `i` is equal to `n`**
