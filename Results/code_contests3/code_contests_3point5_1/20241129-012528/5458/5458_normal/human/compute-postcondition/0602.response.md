Postcondition: ***The final state of the dp array will be updated based on the conditions in the loop code. `j` is now `m+1`, where `m` is greater than or equal to `j`. For the loop to execute the second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
