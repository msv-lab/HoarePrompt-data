Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j + 1 >= k`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute. `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program continues executing according to the if part conditions.***
