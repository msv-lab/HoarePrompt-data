Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 1` are integers. `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j + 1 >= k + 1`, `k + 1` is within the range from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. If `j > k`, there are no changes in the variables and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
