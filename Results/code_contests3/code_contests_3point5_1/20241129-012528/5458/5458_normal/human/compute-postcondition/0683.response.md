Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) filled with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `i` is 0, then additionally `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, then additionally if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and after the execution of the code snippet, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the modulo of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.***
