According to the code, the loop will execute `m` times starting from 1 to `m`. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the final value of `s + 1`, `i` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
