According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `k` starts at 1. Therefore, the modified state should be:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i+1` and `j` are integers, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions**
