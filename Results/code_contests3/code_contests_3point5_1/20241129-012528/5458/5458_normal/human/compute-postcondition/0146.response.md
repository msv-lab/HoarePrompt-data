Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Here, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` becomes 1. The bitwise operation `& 1` with `1` results in `1`. The value of `j + 1` is `j + 1`, and the value of `k` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are all integers. `k` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` are all integers. `k` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
