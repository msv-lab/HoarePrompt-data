According to the code snippet, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s+1`, and the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `k` needs to be updated to `k+1` to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s+1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. The next iteration will have `k` incremented by 1, so `k` will be `s+2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
