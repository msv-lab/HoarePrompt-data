According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is in the range from 1 to s (inclusive). 
For the loop to execute the first time, the following adjustments need to be made to the initial state:
State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is one more than its previous value and less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 1, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions**
