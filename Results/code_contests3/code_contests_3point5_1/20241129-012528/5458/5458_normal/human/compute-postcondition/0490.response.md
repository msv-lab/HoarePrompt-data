Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, and the new value assigned is 1 at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` if `j >= k`.***
