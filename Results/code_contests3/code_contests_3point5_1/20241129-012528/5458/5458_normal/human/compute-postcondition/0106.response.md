Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the final values of the variables will be as follows: `mod` remains 100000, `n` is still greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), and `k` is equal to the final value of `s + 1`. The values in `dp` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop for all valid iterations.**
