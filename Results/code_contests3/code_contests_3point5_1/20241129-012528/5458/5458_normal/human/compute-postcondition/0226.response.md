Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. `k` is the final value of `s + 1` after all iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
