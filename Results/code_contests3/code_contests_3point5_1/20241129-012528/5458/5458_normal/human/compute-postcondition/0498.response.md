Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the final state of the program variables is as follows: `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 4, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, and the 2D list `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified. Specifically, if `i == 0`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `j >= k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, the values of `dp` are updated accordingly, while the rest of the variables maintain their initial state.***
