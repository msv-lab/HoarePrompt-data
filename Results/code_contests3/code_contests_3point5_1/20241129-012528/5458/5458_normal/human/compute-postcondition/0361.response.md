Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. After entering the if condition `j > k`, holds true. The value in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
