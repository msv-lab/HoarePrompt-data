Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), for the loop to execute the second time `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 2. If i == 0, the element at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] in dp is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If i != 0, and j > k, the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remain the same after the execution of the code snippet.***
