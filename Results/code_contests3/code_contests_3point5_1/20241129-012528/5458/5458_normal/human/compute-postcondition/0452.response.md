According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 1, `j` is 2. Since j is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute again, j must be less than or equal to 1+1=2.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the second time `m` must be greater than 0**
