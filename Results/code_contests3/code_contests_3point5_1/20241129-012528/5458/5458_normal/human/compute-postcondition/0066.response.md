Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s+1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
