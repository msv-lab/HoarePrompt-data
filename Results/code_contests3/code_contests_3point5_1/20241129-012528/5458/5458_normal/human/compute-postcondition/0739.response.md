Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions for the loop to execute the first time. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program does not enter the loop and no variables are modified.***
