Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, the previous value of `k` is `k-1`. Therefore, the updated value of `k` is `k`. The states of other variables remain the same. Hence, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
