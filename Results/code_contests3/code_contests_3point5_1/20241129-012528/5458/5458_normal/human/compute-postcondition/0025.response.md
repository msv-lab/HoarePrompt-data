Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the next value within the range of 1 to s, for if i == 0, `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the else part, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
