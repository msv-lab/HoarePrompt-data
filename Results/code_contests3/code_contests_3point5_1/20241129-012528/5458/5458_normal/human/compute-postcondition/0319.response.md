According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

Before the loop starts, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)` all initialized to 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)` all initialized to 0, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
