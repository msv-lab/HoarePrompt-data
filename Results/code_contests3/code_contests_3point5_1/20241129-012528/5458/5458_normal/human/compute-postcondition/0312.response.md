According to the code, the loop will execute indefinitely as it is a `while 1` loop. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are integers. The final value of `k` will be equal to `s + 1` after all iterations. The final state of `dp` may change based on the loop conditions.**
