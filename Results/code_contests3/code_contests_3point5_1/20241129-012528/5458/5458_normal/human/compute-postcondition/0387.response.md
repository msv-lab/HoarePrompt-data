Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. Additionally, after entering the if condition `i` is 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
