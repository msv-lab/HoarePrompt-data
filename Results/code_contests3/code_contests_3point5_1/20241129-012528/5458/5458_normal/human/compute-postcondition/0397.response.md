Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, then after the if condition `i` is 0 and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 in the else part, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` when `j > k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, after the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
