According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
