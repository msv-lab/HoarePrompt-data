According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, which means the loop will not execute. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0. 
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 0, `s` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
