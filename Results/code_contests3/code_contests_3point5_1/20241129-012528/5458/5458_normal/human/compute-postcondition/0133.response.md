Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is the final value of `s` + 2, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time `s` is at least `k`, and `k` is less than or equal to `s + 2.**
