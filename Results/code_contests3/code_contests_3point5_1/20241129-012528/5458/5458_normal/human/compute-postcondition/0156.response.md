According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are integers, `k` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 within the range 1 to `s` inclusive.
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are all integers. `k+1` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k+1]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, all variables remain integers.**
