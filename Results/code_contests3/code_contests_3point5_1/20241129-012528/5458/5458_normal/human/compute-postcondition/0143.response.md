According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to s inclusive.

To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1` are all integers, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range 1 to s inclusive**
