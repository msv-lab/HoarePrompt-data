Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) filled with 0s, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
