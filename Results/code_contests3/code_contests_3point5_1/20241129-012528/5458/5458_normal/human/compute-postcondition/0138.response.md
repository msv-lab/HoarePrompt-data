Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`, and `k` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `k` is increased by 1**.
