According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, `k` is equal to 1, and it iterates until `s + 1`. So, for the loop to execute, `k` needs to be set to 1, and at the end of the loop, `k` should be equal to `s + 1`. The rest of the states remain the same. 
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`**
