Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to calculate the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values**
