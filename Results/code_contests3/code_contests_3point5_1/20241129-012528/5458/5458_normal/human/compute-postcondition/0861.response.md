Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is incremented to 3, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. In the if part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. In the else part, no specific changes are made to the variables.***
