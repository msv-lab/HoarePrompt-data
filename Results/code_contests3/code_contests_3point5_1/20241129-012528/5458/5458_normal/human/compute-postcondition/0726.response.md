Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is s, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. After all iterations of the loop, the values of variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and the elements of `dp` will be determined by the conditional statements within the loop.**
