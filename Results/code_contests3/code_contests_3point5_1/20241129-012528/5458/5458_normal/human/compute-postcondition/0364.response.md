Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. If `i` is 0, then `j` must be greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, the value in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
