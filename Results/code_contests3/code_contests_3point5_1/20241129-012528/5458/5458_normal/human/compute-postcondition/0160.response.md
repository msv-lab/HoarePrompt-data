Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are all integers, `k+1` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k+1`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k+1]` is assigned 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
