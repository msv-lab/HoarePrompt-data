Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. If `j >= k` and `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j >= k` and `i` is 1, then the final state of `dp` is updated according to the given formula.***
