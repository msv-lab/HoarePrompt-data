Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The dimensions of `dp` are (m + 2) x (s + 1), and the loop executes for the first time where `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The previous values of the affected variables are not mentioned, so the output state is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized to 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized to 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
