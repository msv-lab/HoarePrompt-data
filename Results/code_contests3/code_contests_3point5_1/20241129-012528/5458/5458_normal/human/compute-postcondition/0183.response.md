Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `k` is 1, and the loop should execute one more time, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` should be such that the loop condition is satisfied. All variables are less than `m`, `k` is 1, `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: mod, n, m, s, dp, i, j, k are less than `m`, k is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than `k`.
Output State: **mod, n, m, s, dp, i, j, k are less than `m`, k is 1, s is greater than or equal to 1, i is not equal to 0, j is greater than `k`**
