According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a certain value, `n` is also a certain value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be increased by 1. 

State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j` are all integers. The final state of `dp` will be determined by the conditions and calculations within the loop. The final state of `k` will be the final value of `s + 1` after all iterations. If the loop does not execute, the final states of `dp`, `k`, and `i` will remain the same as the initial states. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.**
