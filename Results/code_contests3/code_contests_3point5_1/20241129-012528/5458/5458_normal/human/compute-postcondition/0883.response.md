Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is assigned the value 1. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
