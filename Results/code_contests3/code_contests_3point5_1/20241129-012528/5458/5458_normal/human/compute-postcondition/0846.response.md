Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is 2, and `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program maintains the initial conditions.***
