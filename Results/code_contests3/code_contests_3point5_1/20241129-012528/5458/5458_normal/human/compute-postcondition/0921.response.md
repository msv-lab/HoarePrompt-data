Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2, `i`, `j` are greater than or equal to 1. `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1. After the if else block, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
