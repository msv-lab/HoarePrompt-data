Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 3, `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the third time `m` is greater than 0 and the conditions related to updating `dp` are met. If `j >= k`, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 2D list `dp` is assigned 1.***
