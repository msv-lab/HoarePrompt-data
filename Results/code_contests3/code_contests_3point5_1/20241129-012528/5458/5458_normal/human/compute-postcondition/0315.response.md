Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. The final value of `k` will be equal to `s + 1` after all iterations. The final state of `dp` may change based on the loop conditions. If `n`, `m`, `s` are all 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
