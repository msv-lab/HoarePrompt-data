According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2 and `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2 and `k` should be less than or equal to `s` incremented by 1.
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j` are integers with `n`, `m`, `s` at least 2, `i`, `j` greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is incremented by 1**
