Example Answer:
The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 directly. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not affected by this assignment. As a result, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 2, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 2, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`**
