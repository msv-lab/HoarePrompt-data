According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`mod` is 100001, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3**.
