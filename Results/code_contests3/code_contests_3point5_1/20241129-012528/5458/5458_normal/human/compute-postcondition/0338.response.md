Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. If `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
