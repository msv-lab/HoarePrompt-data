Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s. If `j` is greater or equal to `k`, then the loop proceeds and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is less than `k`, the loop does not execute but `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
