Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are used in the calculation. The dimensions of the `dp` list are also mentioned. Since the calculation involves modulo operation, the final value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be affected by the previous values in the `dp` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
