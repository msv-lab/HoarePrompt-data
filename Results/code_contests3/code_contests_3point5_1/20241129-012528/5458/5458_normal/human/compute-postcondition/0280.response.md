Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change in this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j + 1 >= k`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j + 1 >= k`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s` for the loop to execute. `i` is equal to 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
