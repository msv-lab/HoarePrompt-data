According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s+1.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1**
