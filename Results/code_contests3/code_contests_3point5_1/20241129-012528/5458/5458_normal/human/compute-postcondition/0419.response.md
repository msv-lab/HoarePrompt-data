According to the code, the loop can execute when `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states as follows:

State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than 0**
