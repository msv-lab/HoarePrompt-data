According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `s`, which means `k` should be `s`. Additionally, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` needs to be updated based on the given condition: if `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value of 1, otherwise, it should be the modulo operation result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.

State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `s`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise the value is the modulo operation result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.**
