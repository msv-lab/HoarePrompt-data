Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to either 0 or `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is the next value in the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 after the execution of the if else block.***
