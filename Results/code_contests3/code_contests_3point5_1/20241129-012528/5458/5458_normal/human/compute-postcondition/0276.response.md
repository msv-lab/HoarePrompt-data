According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and it should still be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers. `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j + 1 >= k`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`.**
