Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, but based on the initial state where all variables are less than `m`, the output state is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
