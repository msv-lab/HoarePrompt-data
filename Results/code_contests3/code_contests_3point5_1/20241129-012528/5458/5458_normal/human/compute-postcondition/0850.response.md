Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is 2, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `j` is greater than 2, the program executes based on the updated values in the loop conditions. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
