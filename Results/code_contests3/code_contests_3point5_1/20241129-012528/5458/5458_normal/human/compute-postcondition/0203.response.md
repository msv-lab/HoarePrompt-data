Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the variables.***
