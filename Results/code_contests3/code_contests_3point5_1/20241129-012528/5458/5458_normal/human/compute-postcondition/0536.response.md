Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `s+1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. Additionally, the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` after the execution of the if else block.***
