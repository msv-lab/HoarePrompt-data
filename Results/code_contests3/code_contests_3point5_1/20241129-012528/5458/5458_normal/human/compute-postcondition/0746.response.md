Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly given, but `j` is incremented by 1 and `k` is `s + 2`. Therefore, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions for the next iteration**
