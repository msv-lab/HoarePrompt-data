Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is equal to the next value within the range of 1 to s. If `j` is greater or equal to `k`, then the loop proceeds. However, if `j` is less than `k`, the loop does not execute.***
