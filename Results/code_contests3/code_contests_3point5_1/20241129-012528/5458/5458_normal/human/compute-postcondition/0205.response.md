Example Answer:
The value of `k` is incremented by 1. Then, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After that, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. Since `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` becomes `dp[i & 1][j][k - (j+1)]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values**
