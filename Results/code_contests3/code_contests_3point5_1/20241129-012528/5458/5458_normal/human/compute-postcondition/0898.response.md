Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1. When the if condition (i == 0) is true, `i` is equal to 0***
