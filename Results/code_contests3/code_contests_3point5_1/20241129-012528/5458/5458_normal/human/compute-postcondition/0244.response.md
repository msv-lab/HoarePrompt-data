According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j` are already integers and `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1` and `j >= k`. The new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1, and `k` is now 1.

State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j` are integers, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 1, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod`**
