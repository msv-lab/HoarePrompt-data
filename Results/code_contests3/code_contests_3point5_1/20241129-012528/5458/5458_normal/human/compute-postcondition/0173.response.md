Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are all integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`.***
