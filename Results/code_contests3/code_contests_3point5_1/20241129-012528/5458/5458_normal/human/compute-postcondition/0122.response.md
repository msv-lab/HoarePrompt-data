Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the final value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), `k` is 1, `i` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulus of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` and then incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
