Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is the next value in the range of `n^2`, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `dp` is updated based on loop conditions for the next iteration, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 after the if else block executes.***
