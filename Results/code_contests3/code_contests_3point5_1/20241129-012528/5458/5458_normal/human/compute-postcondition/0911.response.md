Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s` is at least 2, `i`, `j`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1. If j >= k, then `i` is equal to 0 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If j < k, `i` is not equal to 0, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod.**
