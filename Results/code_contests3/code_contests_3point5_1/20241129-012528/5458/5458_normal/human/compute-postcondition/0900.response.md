Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, if (j >= k) is true, `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
