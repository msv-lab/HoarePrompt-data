Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either 1 or the previous value of `dp[i][j][k]` modulo `mod` if `j >= k`. If `i` is not 0, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation mentioned in the code snippet.***
