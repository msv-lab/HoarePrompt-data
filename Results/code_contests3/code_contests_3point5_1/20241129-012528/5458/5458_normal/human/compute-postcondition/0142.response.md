According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `m` and `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i`, `j+1` are all integers**.
