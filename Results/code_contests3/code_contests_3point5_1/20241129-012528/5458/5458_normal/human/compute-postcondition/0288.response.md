Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The calculation is based on the previous values of the variables. 
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k` are integers and the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly**
