Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, where `i` is equal to `n`. `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `dp` is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) filled with 0s.**
