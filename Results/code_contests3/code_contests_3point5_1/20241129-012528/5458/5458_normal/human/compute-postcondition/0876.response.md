Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than or equal to 1, `i`, `j` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and after the if condition `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is executed, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
