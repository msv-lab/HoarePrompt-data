Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed, and `k` is within the range 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are all integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1` are all integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
