According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 and `i` should still be less than `n ** 2`.
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, the final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)`**.
