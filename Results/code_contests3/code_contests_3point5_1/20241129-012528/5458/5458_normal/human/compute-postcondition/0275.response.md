Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k`, `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. The final values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are dependent on the conditions specified in the loop code for each iteration. The variables may undergo changes based on the calculations within the loop, resulting in a final state that reflects the cumulative effects of all iterations.**
