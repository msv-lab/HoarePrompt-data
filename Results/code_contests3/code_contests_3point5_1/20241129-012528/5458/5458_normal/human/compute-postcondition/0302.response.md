Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, the values of `i + 1 & 1` is either 0 or 1 based on the least significant bit of `i + 1`. The values of `dp`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j + 1`, `k + 2` are integers; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
