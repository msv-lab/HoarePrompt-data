Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or `n`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is equal to `n`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` after applying the modulo operation.***
