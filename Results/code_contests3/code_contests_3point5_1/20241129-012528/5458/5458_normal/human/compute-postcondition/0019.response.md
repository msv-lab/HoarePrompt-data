Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `%` denotes the modulo operation. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, and the value of `mod` is also given. Therefore, the Output State is: `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized to 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is 1, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) initialized to 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
