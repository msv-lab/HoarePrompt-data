Postcondition: ***`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` and `j` are integers, `k` is at least 1, `dp` is a 2D list with updated values based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute one more time `j` should be less than `m`, `k` is incremented by 1. `i` is not equal to 0, and after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`***
