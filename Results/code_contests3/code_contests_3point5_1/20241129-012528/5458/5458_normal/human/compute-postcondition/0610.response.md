Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `1`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `s` are known, but the value of `k` is not specified. Therefore, after execution, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is `1`, and `k` should still be less than or equal to `s` to execute the loop a second time.
Output State: **`j` is `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`**
