According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s`, `i`, `j`, and the values stored in the `dp` array. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated, and `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`j` is `m+1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is updated, for the loop to execute a second time `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.**
