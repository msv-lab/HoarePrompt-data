Output State: **`mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than the new value of `j`, `s` is the final value after the loop execution, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1), for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
