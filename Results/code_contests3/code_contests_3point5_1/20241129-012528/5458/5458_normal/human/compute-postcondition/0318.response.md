According to the code, the loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, `j` should be 1 to satisfy the range condition. To ensure the loop executes, adjust the state as follows:
State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)` all initialized to 0**
