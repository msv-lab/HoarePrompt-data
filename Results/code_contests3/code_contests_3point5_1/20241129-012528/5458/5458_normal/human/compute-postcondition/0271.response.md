Postcondition: ***`mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` are integers. `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, `j >= k + 1`, `k + 1` is within the range from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k + 1` remain unchanged and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
