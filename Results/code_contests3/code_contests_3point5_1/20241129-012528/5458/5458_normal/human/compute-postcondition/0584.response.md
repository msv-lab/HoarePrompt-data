Postcondition: ***`mod` remains 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 2, `k` ranges from 1 to `s+1+1+1`. If `i` is 0, the final state of `dp` array has been updated based on the if j >= k logic in the code snippet. If `i` is not 0, the final state of `dp` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
