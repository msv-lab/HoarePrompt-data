According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k`. If `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k`, then the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. `m` is greater than or equal to 1. `k` is the final value of `s + 1` after all iterations. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, the conditions are: `i` becomes 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k`.
State: **All variables `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp`, `k`, `i` are integers. `i` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, and `j >= k**.
