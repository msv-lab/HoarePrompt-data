Output State: **At the end of the loop, `mod` is 100000, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, final state of `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(m+2) x (s+1)` where the values are calculated based on the conditions and equations inside the loop.**
