Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by correctly implementing the logic to determine the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created based on the given input values of N, M, and S. It uses dynamic programming to iterate through the possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card squares and updates the dp array accordingly. The final output is the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000, as required by the problem description.

The program ensures that the integers in each column are arranged in ascending order from top to bottom and that the integer in each square is larger than any integer in the column to the left of that square. It handles multiple datasets and terminates when the input values are all 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description and provides the expected output for each dataset.
