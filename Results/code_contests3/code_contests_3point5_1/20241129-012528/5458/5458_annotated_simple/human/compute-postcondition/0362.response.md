Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i, N, M, S, mod, n, m, s` remain unchanged. Since `j` is 1 and `k` is 1, and `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition `j > k` is not met, so the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, n, m, s are 2, j is 1, k is 1, i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated based on the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, n, m, s are 2, j is 1, k is 1, i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is calculated based on the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
