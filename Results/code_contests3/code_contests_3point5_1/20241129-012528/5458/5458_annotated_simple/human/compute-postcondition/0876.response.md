Postcondition: ***`k` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i` is equal to 0, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time. If i == 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`, otherwise there is no change in the program state. If i != 0, `k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, and the loop continues executing.***
