Postcondition: ***All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new calculated value.***
