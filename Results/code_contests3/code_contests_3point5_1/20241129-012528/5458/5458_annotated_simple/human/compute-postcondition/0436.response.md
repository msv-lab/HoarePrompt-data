Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all variables are 1 and k is 2 for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are all 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are all 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
