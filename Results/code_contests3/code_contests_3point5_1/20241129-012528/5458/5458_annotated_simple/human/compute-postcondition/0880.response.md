Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as specified. The value of `k` is not explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, so it remains the same. The condition for updating `k` and `s` is not met, so they retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` needs to be updated to a value greater than `s + 1`, `s` needs to be updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`k` needs to be updated to a value greater than `s + 1`, `s` needs to be updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time**
