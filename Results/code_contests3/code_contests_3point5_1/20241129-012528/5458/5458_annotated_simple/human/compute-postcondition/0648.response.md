Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Since the assignment operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been previously executed, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has a specific value. Therefore, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` can be calculated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation.**
