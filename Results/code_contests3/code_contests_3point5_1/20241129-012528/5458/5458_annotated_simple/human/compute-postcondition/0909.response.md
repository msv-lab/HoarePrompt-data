Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k`. If `i == 0`, then `dp` is updated with the value 1 at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0 and `j > k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
