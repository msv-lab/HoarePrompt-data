According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are all 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
