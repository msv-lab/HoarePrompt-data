According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `k` should be increased by 1 but not greater than `s`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 if `j >= k` is true when `i` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k` without any additional conditions.**
