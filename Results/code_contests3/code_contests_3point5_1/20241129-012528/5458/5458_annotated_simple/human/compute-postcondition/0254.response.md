Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the calculation, but their previous values are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: All variables remain positive integers. 
Output State: **All variables remain positive integers**
