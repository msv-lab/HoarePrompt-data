According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute the second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 2 and `k` is 1. So, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted such that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is equal to 1. 
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**
