Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+2`, and `k+3` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: *N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+3 are positive integers. If j > k, all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues to execute. 
Output State: ***N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+3 are positive integers. If j > k, all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues to execute.***
