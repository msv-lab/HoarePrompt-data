Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i` and `j` are increased by 1, and `k` remains the same unless `k` is less than or equal to `s`, in which case `k` is increased by 1. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, where `k` may have been increased by 1 if it was less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, where `k` may have been increased by 1 if it was less than or equal to `s`**
