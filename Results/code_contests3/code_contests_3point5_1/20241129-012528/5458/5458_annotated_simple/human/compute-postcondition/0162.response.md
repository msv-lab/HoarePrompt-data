Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+2`, and `k+2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute the second time**
