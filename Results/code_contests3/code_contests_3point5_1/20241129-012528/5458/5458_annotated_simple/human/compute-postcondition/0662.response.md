According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0 and `m` is at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
