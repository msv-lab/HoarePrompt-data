Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop executes one more time. If i is 0, `j` is set to 2, otherwise `j` is set to 1. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation.***
