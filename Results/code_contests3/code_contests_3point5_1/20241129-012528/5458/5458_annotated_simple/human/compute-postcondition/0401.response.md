Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact values after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1**
