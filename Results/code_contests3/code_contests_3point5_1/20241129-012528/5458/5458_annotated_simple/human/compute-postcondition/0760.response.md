Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is increased by 1 if it's less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. Otherwise, the state of the variables `i`, `j`, and `k` will depend on the specific values after the operation.***
