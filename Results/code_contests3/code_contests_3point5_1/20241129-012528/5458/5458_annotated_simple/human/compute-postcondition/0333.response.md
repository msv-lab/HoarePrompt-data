Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Since `i`, `j`, and `k` are all 1, the new values for `i + 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` will be 2. Therefore, the updated value in the dp array is at index `[1][2][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1, dp array is updated at index [1][2][1] with value 1**
