According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise, no changes are made. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
