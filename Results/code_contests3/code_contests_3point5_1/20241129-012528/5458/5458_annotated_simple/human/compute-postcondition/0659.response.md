Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation. If i == 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains updated based on the modulo operation.***
