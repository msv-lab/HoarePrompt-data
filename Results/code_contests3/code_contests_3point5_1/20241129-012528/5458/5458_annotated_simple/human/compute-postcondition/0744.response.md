Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers, so `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, and `k`, the output state will be as follows:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
