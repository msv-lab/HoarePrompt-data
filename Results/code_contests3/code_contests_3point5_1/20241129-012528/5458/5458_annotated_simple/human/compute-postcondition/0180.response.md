Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, k is less than s and k is incremented by 1. Additionally, i is equal to 0. If j >= k, the new value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1 while all other variables remain positive integers with their previous values.***
