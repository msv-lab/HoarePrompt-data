Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
