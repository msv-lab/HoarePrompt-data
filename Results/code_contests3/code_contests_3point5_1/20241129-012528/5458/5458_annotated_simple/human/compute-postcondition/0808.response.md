Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`.***
