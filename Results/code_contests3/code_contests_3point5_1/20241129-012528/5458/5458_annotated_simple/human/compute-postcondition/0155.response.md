Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If i == 0 and j >= k, the dp array at index i + 1 & 1, j + 1, k is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the remainder of dividing dp[i & 1][j][k - j] by mod.***
