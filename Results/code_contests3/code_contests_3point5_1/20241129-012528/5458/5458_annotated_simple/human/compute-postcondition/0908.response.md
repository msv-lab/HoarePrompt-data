Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 1, i is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod**
