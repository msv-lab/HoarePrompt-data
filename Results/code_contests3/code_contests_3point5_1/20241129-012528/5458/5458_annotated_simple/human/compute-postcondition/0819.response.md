Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified, so the output state is: No specific adjustment needed for `k` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **No specific adjustment needed for `k` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time**
