According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `m` inclusive. So, to ensure the loop executes one more time, the variable `j` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `(n`**
