According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next integer value within that range. The other variables do not affect the loop execution.

State: **All variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp`) are integers with specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the same, `k` is the next integer value within the range of 1 to `s`**
