According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is less than or equal to s. To ensure the loop executes at least one more time, k should be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, k should be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1**
