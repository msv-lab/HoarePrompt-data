According to the code, the loop will execute as long as j is within the range of 1 to m inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, j is within the range of 1 to m inclusive. So for the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s, i, j, k are positive integers. The dp array is updated such that dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 if j >= k. The loop will not execute if either i or j is 0. If the loop does not execute, all variables remain positive integers.**
