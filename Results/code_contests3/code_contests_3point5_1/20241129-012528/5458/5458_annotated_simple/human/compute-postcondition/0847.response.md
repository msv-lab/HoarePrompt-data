Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`**
