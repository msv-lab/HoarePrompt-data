Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the modulo operation. The loop or execution continues as specified in the condition. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the new calculated value and the program continues the loop or execution.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the new calculated value and the program continues the loop or execution.**
