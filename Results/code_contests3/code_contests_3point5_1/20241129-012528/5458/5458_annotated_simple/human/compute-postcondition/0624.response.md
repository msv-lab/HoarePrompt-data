Example Answer:
The values of the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned by splitting the input string into integers. Since the code snippet is `break`, it does not change the values of any variables but simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
