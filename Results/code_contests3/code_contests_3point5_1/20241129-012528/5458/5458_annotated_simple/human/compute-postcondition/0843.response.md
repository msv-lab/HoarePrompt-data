Postcondition: ***`k`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k` starts from 1 and iterates up to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0, then for each `j` greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then for each `j` greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
