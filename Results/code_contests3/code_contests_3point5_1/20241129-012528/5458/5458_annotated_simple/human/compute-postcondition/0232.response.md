Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s are positive integers. `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1 if `i` is 0. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
