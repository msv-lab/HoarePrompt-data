Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since all variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are incremented by 3, the new values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are incremented by 3, i is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are incremented by 3, i is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
