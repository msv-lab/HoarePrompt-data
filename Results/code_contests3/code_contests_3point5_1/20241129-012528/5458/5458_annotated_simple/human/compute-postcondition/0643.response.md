Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly given, but it is mentioned that the loop should execute one more time, so `j` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string; `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string; `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0**
