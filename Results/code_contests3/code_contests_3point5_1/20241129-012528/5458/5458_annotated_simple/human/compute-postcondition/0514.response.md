Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known to be within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain within their specified ranges and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is performed.
Output State: **All variables remain within their specified ranges, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is performed**
