Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain the same. If `i` is equal to 0, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` >= `k`, the program executes specified operations. Otherwise, when `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
