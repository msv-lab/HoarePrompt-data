Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.
Output State: **`k` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
