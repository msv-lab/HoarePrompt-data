Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. This operation does not affect the values of `k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` as mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers and remain unchanged.
Output State: **`k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers and remain unchanged**
