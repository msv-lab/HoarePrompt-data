According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of `k`, `s`, `i`, `m`, `j` are integers, and for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` must be less than or equal to `m. So, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and `i` is 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time**
