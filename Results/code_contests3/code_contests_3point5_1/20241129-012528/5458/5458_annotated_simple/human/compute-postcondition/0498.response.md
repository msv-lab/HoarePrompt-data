Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` are integers with specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` is the same, `k` is the next integer value within the range of 1 to `s`, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.***
