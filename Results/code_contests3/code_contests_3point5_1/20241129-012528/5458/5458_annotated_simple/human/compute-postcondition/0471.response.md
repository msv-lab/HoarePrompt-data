Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, `dp[3][3][1]` are integers with values 2, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[3][3][1]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[3][3][1]` is updated as `dp[2][3][1] % 2` and `dp[3][3][1]` is incremented by `dp[2][2][0] % 2.***
