Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. The values of i, j, and k are 0. Therefore, after execution, dp[1][1][0] is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, dp[1][1][0] is 1**
