Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.
