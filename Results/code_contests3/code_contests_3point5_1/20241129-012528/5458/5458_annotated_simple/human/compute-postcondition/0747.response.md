Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop and continues with the next iteration. Since no loop is mentioned in the initial state, the program simply moves to the next line of code. The values of the variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers**
