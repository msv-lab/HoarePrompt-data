Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j=3`, `k+1`, `i` are integers obtained by splitting the input string where `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k+1` is within the range from 1 to s inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
