Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute the second time. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the program continues with the given initial variable conditions.***
