Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it continues to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration**
