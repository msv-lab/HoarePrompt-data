According to the code, the loop will execute `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k` are positive integers. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `(n ** 2) - 1`.
State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k` are positive integers, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `(n ** 2) - 1`**
