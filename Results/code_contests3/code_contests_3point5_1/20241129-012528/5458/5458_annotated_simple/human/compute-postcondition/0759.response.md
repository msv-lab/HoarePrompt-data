Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so we cannot determine the exact values after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is dependent on the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` after the operation.
Output State: **Depends on the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` after the operation**
