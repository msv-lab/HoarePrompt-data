Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element in the 3D list dp at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged, the values of `i`, `m`, `j` remain the same. `k` is updated to a value greater than `s + 1`, and `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated to a value greater than `s + 1`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`k` is updated to a value greater than `s + 1`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time**
