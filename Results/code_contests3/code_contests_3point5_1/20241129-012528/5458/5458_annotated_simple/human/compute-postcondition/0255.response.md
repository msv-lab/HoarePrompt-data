Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be positive integers. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: All variables remain positive integers.
Output State: **All variables remain positive integers**
