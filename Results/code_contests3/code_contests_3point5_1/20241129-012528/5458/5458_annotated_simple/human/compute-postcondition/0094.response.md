Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k` are all integers where `m+1` is the value of `N` and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
