Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. All variables `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `k` and `s` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they are also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `s` are integers, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`k`, `s` are integers, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged**
