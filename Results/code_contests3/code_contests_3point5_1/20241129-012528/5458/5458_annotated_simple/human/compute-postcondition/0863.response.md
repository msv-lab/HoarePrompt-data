According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the final values of `k`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers, and the final values of `dp` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **Final values of `k`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers, `j` is updated to `j + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.**
