Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N, M, S` remain positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
