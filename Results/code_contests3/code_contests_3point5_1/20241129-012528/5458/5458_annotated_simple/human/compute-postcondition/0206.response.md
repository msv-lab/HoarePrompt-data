Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+3 are positive integers. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If j > k, then if i == 0 and j >= k+1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1] is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of the modulo operation between the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and mod.***
