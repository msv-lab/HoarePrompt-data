According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of k from 1 to s. At the end of the previous iteration, all variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. For the next iteration, k will be increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, k should be less than or equal to s+1. All other variables retain their positive integer values from before.
State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+3 are positive integers. If i == 0 and j >= k+1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1] is assigned the value 1, and all other variables retain their positive integer values from before.**
