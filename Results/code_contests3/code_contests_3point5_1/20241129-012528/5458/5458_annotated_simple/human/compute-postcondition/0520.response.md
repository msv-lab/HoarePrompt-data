According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is incremented by 1, and `i` should be less than `n`.

State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k`, `i`, and `dp` are all integers with specific values. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n`.**
