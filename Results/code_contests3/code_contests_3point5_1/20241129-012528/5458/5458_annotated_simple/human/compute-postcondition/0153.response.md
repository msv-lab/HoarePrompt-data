Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The values of i, j, and k are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 maintain their previous values.
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 maintain their previous values**
