Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+3 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 3 for the loop to execute the third time. If i == 0 and j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i != 0 or j > k, all variables remain unchanged and the loop continues to execute.***
