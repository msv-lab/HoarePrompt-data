Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are all incremented by 1. i is less than n. dp is an integer with a specific value. Additionally, i is not equal to 0. If j > k, the state of the program is such that j is greater than k. Furthermore, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
