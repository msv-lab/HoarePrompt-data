Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s are positive integers. `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. After the execution of the if-else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`***
