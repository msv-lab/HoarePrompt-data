Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k` remain unchanged and are positive integers. The output state is as follows:
Output State: **`k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers and remain unchanged**
