Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+m`, `k+s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers. The dp array is updated such that dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 if j >= k. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be `k + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.***
