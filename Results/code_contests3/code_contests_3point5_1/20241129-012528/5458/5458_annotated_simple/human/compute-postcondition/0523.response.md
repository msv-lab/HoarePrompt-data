Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k` are all incremented by 1. `i` is less than `n`, `dp` is an integer with a specific value. Additionally, when the if condition `i == 0` is met, all variables retain their initial state but `i` is now equal to 0. In addition, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
