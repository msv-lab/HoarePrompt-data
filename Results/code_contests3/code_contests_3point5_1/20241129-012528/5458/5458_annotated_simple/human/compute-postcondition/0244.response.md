According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `k` is set to 1 and `j` is 2. Additionally, the `dp` array has been updated for all possible combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+m`, `k+s` are positive integers, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1**
