Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1 if `j >= k` is true when `i` is 0. If `i` is not 0, then `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k` without any additional conditions.***
