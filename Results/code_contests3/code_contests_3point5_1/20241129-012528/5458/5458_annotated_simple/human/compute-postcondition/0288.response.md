Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod**
