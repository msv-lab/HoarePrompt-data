Example Answer:
The `continue` statement is encountered within a loop, which skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration. As a result, the loop will continue executing with the next iteration. Since no variable values are modified by this statement, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s, i, j, k are positive integers. For the loop to execute s is greater than or equal to 1, j is greater than 0, i is greater than 0, and j >= k for dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to be set to 1. The value of i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k**
