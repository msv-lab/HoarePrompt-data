Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known to be positive integers. Therefore, the output state is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers. If j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration. 
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers. If j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration.**
