Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. There are no changes to the other variables stated in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: No changes in the state of variables.
Output State: **No changes in the state of variables**
