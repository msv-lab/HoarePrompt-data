Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s are positive integers. i is incremented by 1. If i is 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned 1. If i is not 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo result of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. For the loop to execute one more time, k should be incremented by 1 and not exceed s. After executing the if-else block and the condition j > k is true, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] remains equal to the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the modulo result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] with respect to mod.**
