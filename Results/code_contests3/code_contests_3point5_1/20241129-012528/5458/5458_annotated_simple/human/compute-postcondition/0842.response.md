Output State: **`k` starts from 1 and iterates up to `s`, `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the sum of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`**
