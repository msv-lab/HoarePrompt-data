Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s, i, j, k are positive integers. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `j >= k`, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j > k`, all variables maintain their positive integer values. The loop continues executing with the specified conditions, `k` is incremented by 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].***
