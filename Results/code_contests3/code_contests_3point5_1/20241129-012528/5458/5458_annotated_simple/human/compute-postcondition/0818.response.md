According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` should be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is not equal to 0, then no change in the program state is required. 

Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, the condition `i` is not given, `j` is not given, and `k` should be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **No specific adjustment needed for `k` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time**
