Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain integers, and the stated assignment takes place.
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k+1 are integers. Additionally, m+1 is the value of N, k+1 is the next value of k. If j > k, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement. The assignment dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod is executed.**
