Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s are positive integers, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or condition.***
