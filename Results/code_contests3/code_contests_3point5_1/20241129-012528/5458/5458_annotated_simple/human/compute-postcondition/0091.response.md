Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s` remain the same. After execution, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 2`, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` is at least 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 2`, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` is at least 1, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
