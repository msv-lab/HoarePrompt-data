Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known to be greater than or equal to 1, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`**
