Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k+1` remain positive integers. The loop continues based on the conditions mentioned, without specifying any specific values for `N, M, S, n, m, s`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k+1` are positive integers and the specific calculation has been performed as mentioned.
Output State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k+1` are positive integers and the specific calculation has been performed as mentioned.**
