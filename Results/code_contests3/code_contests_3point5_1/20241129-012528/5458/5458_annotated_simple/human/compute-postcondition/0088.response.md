According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 1`, for the loop to execute `s` must be at least 1. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Otherwise, `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 1`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 2`.

State: **`N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` is at least 1.**
