Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j=3`, `k+1`, `i`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are integers obtained by splitting the input string where `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is less than `s`, `k+1` is within the range from 1 to s inclusive, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` >= `k`, otherwise `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the state of the program variables remains unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
