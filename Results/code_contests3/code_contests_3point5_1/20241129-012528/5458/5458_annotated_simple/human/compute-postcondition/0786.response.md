Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, where `i`, `j`, `k` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block for the next iteration to execute. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block for the next iteration to execute.
Output State: **`k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block for the next iteration to execute**
