Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions based on the values of `m` and `s`. Each element of the list is a list of size `s+1` initialized with 0. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. If `n == m == s == 0`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of `n`, `m`, or `s`.
