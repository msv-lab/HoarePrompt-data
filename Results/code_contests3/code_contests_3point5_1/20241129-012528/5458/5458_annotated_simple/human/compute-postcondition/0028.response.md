Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers such that 1 <= `N` <= 7, 1 <= `M` <= 2000, 1 <= `S` <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m`, `s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (`m + 2`) x (`s + 1`) x 2. If `i` == 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. If `i` != 0, the loop executes with `i` starting at 1, `j` starting at 2, `k` starting at 1. If `j` > `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 0. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. For each iteration, `k` is increased by 1.**
