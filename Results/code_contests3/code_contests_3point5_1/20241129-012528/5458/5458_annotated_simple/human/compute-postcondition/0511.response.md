Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `j`, and `k+1` respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` has been incremented by 1, `k+1`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` has been incremented by 1, `k+1`**
