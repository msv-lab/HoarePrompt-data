Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are positive integers satisfying the constraints. The `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop code, with the final values depending on the specific values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` and the conditions specified within the loop when `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0.**
