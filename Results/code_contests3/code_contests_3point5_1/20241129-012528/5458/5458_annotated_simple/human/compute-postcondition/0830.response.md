According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is a positive integer. The loop iterates from 1 to `m + 1`. Before the loop starts, `k` is an integer less than or equal to `s`, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is an integer less than or equal to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is `j - 1`, and `j` is 1.
State: **`k` is an integer less than or equal to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is `j - 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `m` is a positive integer**
