Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, k is incremented by 1. i is not equal to 0. If j is greater than k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The loop continues without affecting the variables.**
