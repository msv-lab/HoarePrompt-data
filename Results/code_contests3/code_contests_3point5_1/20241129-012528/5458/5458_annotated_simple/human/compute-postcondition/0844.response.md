According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`**
