According to the code provided, for the loop to execute the second time, the variable `k` must be greater than 1 and `s` must be greater than 1. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
State: **`N, M, S` are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `s` must be greater than 1, `k` must be 2**

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `s` should be greater than 2 to satisfy the condition for the next iteration of the loop.
- `k` should be incremented by 1 to move on to the next value of `k`.

Updated State: **`N, M, S` are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `s` must be greater than 2, `k` must be 3**
