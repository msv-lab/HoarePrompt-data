Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the value remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` are integers with specific values.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` are integers with specific values**
