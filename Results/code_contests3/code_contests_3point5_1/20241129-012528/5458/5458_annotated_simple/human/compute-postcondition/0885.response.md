Postcondition: ***`k`, `s`, `i`, `m`, `j` are integers. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then `k` is updated to a value greater than `s + 1` and `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value. `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time. If `i == 0` but `j < k`, there is no change in the values of the variables. If `i != 0`, `k`, `s` are updated based on the calculation involving dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged.***
