According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
