Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Since the value of i is not specified in the initial state, we can't determine the exact values of dp. Therefore, the Output State is: `k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`**
