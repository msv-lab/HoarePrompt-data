Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1. If i equals 0, for the loop to execute another time, `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`. For the else part, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and updated values are utilized for further calculations in the program.***
