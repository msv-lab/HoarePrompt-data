Output State: **`k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block for the next iteration to execute. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` for the next iteration to execute. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
