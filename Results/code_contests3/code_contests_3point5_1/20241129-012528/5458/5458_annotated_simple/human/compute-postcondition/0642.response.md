According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `k` has been updated and its value is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state must be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.**
