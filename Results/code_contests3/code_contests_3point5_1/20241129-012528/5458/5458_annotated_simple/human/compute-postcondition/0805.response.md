Postcondition: ***`k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0. If j > k, then `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `k`, `i`, and `j`.***
