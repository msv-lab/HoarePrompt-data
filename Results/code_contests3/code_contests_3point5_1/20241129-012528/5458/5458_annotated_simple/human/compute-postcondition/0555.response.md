Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are all integers incremented by 1. If i == 0, dp is updated with dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1, j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo division of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod, if j > k then j is greater than k. For the loop to execute one more time, k will be incremented by 2, and all other variables will be incremented by 1 as well, k is less than or equal to s. Additionally, i is equal to 0***
