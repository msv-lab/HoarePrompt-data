Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers. The `dp` array will be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for all iterations. The values of `k` will range from 1 to `s`, `j` will range from 1 to `m`, and `i` will be either 0 or 1.**
