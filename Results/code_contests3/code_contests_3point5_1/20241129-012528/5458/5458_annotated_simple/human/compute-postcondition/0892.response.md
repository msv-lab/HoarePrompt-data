Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time if `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k`, `s` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above. `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time if `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`k`, `s` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above. `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time if `j` is greater than `k`**.
