According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be assigned the value 1 if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute another time `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`**
