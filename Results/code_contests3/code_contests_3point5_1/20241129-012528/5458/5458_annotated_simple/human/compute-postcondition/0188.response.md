Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, k is less than s and k is incremented by 1. If i is equal to 0, then if j >= k, the new value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 while the remaining variables retain their positive integer values from before. If i is not equal to 0, the equation dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod is executed utilizing the values of i, j, k, mod, and the dp array for calculation.***
