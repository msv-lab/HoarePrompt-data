Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000. mod is assigned the value 100000, n, m, s are assigned the values obtained from the input split. If n, m, s are all equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2.**
