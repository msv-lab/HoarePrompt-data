Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s are positive integers, `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or condition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
