Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `s`, `j`, and `k` after the execution of the provided Python code snippet.***
