According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is less than or equal to s. At the end of the last iteration, all variables are 1. Since i == 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of k should be incremented to continue the loop.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are all 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute one more time**
