Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables involved in this operation are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The previous values of these variables are known, so we can calculate the result based on those values. Since the `%` operator calculates the remainder after division, the output state will depend on the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.
Output State: **Depends on the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` after the operation**
