According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables k and s. At the end of the last iteration, k is less than s and k is incremented by 1. If i is equal to 0 and j >= k, then the new value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1. If i is not equal to 0, the equation dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod is executed. 
So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1] and the remaining variables retain their positive integer values from before**
