Output State: **`k` starts from 1 and iterates up to `s`, where `s` is a positive integer. `i` is 0, `m` is a positive integer, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
