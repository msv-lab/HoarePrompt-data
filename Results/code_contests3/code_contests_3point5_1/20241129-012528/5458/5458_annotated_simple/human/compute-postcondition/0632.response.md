Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0 and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
