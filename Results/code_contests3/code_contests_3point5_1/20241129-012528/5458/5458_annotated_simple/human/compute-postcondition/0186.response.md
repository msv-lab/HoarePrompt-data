Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the result of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod. The values of i, j, k, mod are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, k is less than s and k is incremented by 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, if j is greater than k, then the program will continue.
