Postcondition: ***`k`, `s` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above. `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the state of the program variables is updated according to the specific conditions mentioned for `k` and `s`. If `j` is less than `k`, then `k`, `s` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.***
