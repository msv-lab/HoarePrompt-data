According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` needs to be at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than 0 and `k` is 1**
