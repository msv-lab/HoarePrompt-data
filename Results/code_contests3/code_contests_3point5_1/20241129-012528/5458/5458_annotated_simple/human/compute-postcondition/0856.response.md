Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`.
Output State: **`k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`**
