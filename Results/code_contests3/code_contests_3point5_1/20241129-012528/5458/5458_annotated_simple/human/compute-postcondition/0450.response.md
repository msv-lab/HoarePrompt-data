Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are all 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are all 1, `k` is 1 for the loop execution to finish, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
