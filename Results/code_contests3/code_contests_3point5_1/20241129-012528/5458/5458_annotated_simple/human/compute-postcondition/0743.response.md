According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions related to `dp` values. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i+1`, `m`, `n` are integers, and `k` is 1 to enter the loop. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- Update `k` to the next value in the range of 1 to `s` (increment `k` by 1).
- Adjust the values of `i+1`, `j`, and `k` in accordance with the conditions specified for the loop execution.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers.**
