Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` remain the same. For the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
