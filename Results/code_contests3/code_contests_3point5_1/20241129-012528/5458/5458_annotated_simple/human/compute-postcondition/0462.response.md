Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers with values 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than 0 and `k` must be 1. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the dp array is updated as dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the program continues without any changes in the variables. Otherwise, there are no changes in the variables.***
