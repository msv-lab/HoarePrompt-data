Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j=3`, `k` are integers obtained by splitting the input string where `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is within the range from 1 to s inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Additionally, `i` is now equal to 0.***
