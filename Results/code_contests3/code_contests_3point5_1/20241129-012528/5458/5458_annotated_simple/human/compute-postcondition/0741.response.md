Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string, `i+1` is an integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
