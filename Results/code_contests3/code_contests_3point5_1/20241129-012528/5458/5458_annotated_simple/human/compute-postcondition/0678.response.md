Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is updated based on the loop condition and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` are adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is updated based on the loop condition and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` are adjusted accordingly**
