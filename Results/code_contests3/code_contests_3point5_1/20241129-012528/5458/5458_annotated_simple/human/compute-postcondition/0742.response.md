Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. Initially, `j` is 1, `k` is obtained by splitting the input string, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
