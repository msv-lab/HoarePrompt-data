According to the code, the `while 1` loop will continue indefinitely until explicitly broken. Therefore, the loop will certainly execute one more time. Since the loop will execute again, there is no need to adjust any states.
State: **The final value of dp will depend on the specific values of N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k, and the conditions specified in the loop when n, m, and s are all equal to 0. Since the loop will execute again, no states need to be adjusted.**
