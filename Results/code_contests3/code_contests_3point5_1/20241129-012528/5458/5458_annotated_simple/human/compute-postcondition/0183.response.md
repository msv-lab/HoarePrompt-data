Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, k is less than s and k is incremented by 1. i is not equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than k.
