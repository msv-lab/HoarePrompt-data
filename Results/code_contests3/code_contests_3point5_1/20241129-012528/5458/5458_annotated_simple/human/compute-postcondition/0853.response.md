According to the code, the loop executes for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k+1`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers, and `k+1` is less than or equal to `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` needs to be considered. Since the loop goes from 1 to `s`, the next value of `k` should be the current `k + 1` if it is less than `s`. 

State: **`k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`**
