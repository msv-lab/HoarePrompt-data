Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 when the conditions `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k` are met. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if the conditions are met.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`**
