According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range from 1 to `s` inclusive. Since the loop needs to execute one more time, `k` should be updated to `s + 1` to ensure the loop completes its last iteration. Additionally, `s` should be updated to a value greater than the current value to ensure the loop executes one more time. Finally, `i`, `m`, and `j` are not explicitly mentioned in the loop, so they can remain unchanged.
State: **`k` is `s + 1`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time**
