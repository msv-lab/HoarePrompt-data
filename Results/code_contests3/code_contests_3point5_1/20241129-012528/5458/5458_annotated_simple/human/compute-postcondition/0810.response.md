Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The variable `k` needs to be adjusted accordingly to the conditions specified above for the loop to execute one more time. The states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` should be adjusted accordingly to the conditions specified above for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`k` should be adjusted accordingly to the conditions specified above for the loop to execute one more time**
