Since the `while` loop condition is `while 1`, which is equivalent to `while True`, the loop will certainly execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, and 1 <= S <= 3000. mod is assigned the value 100000**
