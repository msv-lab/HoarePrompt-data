Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is 1. The value of `i` is 0. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.**
