Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s, i, j, k are positive integers. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `j >= k` for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be set to 1. After entering the if condition `i` is equal to 0***
