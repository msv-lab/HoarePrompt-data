Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, and `j >= k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod` if `j > k`, otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.**
