Postcondition: ***All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program continues with the existing positive integer values of the variables. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
