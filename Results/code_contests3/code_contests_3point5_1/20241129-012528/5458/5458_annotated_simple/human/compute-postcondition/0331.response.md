Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are all 1. The loop has executed for the first time when `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the dp array is updated at dp[1][j+1][k] with the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same and the loop continues. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop proceeds. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
