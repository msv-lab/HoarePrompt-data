Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly defined, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1**
