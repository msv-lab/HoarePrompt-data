According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1` being positive integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is now 1.
State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1` are positive integers, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
