According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain the same. The values of `dp` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same, hence `i` should be less than `n ** 2 + 1`.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain the same, for the loop to execute another time `i` is less than `n ** 2 + 1`**
