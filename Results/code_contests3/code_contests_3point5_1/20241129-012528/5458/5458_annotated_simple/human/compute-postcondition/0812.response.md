Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `k` needs to be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` should be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`k` should be adjusted accordingly for the loop to execute one more time**
