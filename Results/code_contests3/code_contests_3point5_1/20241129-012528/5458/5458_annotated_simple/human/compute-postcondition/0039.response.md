Postcondition: ***N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, n is 1, m, s are assigned the values obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list with updated values based on the provided code snippet, k is 2. If i == 0, the program executes based on the provided conditions. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous values of dp, j, and k.***
