Example Answer:
The value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` list is assigned the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The loop variables are updated as i becomes 1, j becomes 2, and k remains 1. Since the `dp` list is initialized with zeros, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is 0. Therefore, the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is also assigned 0.
Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, n is 1, m, s are assigned the values obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, for the loop to execute the first time i is 1, j is 2, k is 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 0.**
