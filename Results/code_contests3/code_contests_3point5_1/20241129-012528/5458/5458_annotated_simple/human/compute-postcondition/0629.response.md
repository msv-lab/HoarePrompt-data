According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being greater than 0 and `m` being at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is greater than 0. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0**
