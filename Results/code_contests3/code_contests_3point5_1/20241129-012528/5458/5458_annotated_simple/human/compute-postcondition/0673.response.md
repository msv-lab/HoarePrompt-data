Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. After executing the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
