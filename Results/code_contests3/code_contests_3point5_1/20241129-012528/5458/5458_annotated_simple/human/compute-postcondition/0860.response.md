Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] modulo mod. The previous values of i, j, k, and dp are not provided, so the specific values cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.
Output State: **`k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
