Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so we can't calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: No specific adjustment needed for `k` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **No specific adjustment needed for `k` at the end of the previous iteration for the loop to execute one more time**
