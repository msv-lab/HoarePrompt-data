Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0. The values of `dp` array have been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop code for all iterations of the loop.**
