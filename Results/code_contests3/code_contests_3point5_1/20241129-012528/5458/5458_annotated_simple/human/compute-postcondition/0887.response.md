Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. The variables `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The values of `k` and `s` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated, `s` is updated, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`k` is updated, `s` is updated, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged**
