According to the code, the loop executes `n ** 2` times. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer less than or equal to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 within the range of `n` and `j` needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
State: **`k` is an integer less than or equal to `s`, `s` is a positive integer, `i+1`, `j adjusted accordingly based on loop conditions**, `dp` array adjusted accordingly based on loop conditions.
