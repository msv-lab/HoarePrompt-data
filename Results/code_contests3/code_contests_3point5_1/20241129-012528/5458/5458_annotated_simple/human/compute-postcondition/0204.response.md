Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of the modulo operation between the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`. All other variables retain their positive integer values. 
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+3 are positive integers. If j > k, then if i == 0 and j >= k+1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1] is assigned the value 1, and all other variables retain their positive integer values from before. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of the modulo operation between the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `mod`.**
