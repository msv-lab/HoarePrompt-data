According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `i` remain the same. So for the loop to be executed one more time `k` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain the same, for the loop to execute one more time `k` should be incremented by 1**
