Example Answer:
The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the variables are not directly influenced by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.
Output State: **`k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. `k+2` is less than or equal to `s`. If j > k, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**
