Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The states of `k` and `s` are updated based on the conditions mentioned above. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `s` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `s` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time**
