Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+m`, `k+s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers. The dp array is updated such that dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1 if j >= k. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be `k + 1`. If i == 0 and j >= k, then dp[i][j + 1][k + 1] is set to 1. Otherwise, if i != 0, all variables remain positive integers, and the dp array is updated as described. Additionally, if j >= k, k is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute another time. If j is greater than or equal to k, then k is further incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.***
