Postcondition: ***`k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` are variables that are updated based on the conditions specified in the if-else block for the next iteration to execute. If j >= k, then the values of `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` are modified according to the specified conditions. Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp`. After executing the code snippet, if i == 0, the values of `k`, `i`, `j`, `dp` are updated according to the conditions specified in the if part. If i is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
