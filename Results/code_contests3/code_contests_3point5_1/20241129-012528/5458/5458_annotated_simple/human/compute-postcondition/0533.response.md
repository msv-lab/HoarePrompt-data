Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are all integers incremented by 1. i is less than n. dp is an integer with a specific value. When i == 0, all variables retain their initial state except i which is now equal to 0. Additionally, j is greater than or equal to k. If i is not equal to 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo division of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod. If j > k, the state of the program is such that j is greater than k.***
