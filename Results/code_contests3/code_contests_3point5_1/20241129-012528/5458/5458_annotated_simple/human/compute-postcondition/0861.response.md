Postcondition: ***`k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the same values of `k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the program halts. If `i` is not equal to 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement with the same values of `k+2`, `s`, `i`, `m`.***
