According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`, `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` should be incremented by 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, `k` should be incremented by 1.
- `k` should be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`k` should be adjusted accordingly to the conditions specified above for the loop to execute one more time**
