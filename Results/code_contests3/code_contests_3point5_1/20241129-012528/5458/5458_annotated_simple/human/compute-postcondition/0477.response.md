Postcondition: ***All variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp[3][3][1]`) are integers with specified values. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[3][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[3][3][1]` is updated as `dp[2][3][1] % 2` and incremented by `dp[2][2][0] % 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[3][3][1]` is updated based on the conditions mentioned. After the execution of the code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1***
