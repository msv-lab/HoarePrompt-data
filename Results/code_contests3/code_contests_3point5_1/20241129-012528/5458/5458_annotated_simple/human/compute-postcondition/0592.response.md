Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k are all integers incremented by 1. If i is not 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding the modulo division of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] with mod. For the loop to execute one more time, k will be incremented by 2, and all other variables will be incremented by 1 as well, k is less than or equal to s. Additionally, after the if condition (j >= k) is met, the relationship between j and k is such that j is greater than or equal to k, for the loop to execute the first time k is equal to 1 and j is equal to 1. The negation of the if condition (i == 0) is true, indicating that i is not equal to 0.***
