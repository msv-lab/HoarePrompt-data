Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i` and `k` are updated as `i + 1` and `j + 1` respectively. The other variables `m` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, and the loop continues executing.
Output State: **`k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, and the loop continues executing**
