The loop will execute as long as j ranges from 1 to m+1. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes the first time, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, n is 1, m, s are assigned the values obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0, j is 1**
