Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
