Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the values of the variables are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation**
