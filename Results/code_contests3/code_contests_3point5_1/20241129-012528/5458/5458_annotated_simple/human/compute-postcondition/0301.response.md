Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s, i, j, k are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `j >= k+1`, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j >= k`, then `k` is increased by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
