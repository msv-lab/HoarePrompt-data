According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the values are: `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k` are all integers, `m+1` is the value of `N`, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the given conditions.

For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` should be within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:
State: **`N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j, k+1` are all integers, `m+1` is the value of `N`, `k+1` is the next value of `k`**.
