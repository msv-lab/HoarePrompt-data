Postcondition: ***`k` is 1, `s` is a value greater than 1, `k` is less than `s`, `i` is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions of the if-else block. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.***
