Postcondition: ***All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+m, k+s, i, j, k are positive integers. For the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, and `j >= k` for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be set to 1. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either set to 1 if the if condition is met, or updated to the remainder of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] divided by mod if the else condition is executed. Additionally, `i` is either 0 or remains the same, and `j` remains greater than or equal to `k` based on the execution path.***
