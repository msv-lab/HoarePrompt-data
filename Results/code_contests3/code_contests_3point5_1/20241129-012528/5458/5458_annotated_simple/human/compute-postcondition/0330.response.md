Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and the loop proceeds. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
