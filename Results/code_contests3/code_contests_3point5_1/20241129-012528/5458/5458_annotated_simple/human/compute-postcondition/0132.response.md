According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the conditions inside the loop body. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers, and `k` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k+1` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k+1` is less than or equal to `s**.
