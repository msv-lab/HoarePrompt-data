Since the loop is iterating over `j` in the range from 1 to `m`, the loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has finished all iterations, so the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, and `j` are not provided. To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `m`.
State: **The loop has finished all iterations. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be less than `m`**
