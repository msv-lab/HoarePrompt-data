Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string, `i+1` is an integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, then the loop condition is met where `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
