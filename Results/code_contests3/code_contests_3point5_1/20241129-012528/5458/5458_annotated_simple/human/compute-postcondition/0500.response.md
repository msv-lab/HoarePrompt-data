Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, `M`, and `n` respectively. The value of `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1 (since `i` is 0), so the updated `dp` value is `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are the next integer value within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s` are the next integer value within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1**
