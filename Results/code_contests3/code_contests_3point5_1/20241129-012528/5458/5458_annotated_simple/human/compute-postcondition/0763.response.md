According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since the loop has finished all iterations, to execute the loop one more time, `k` should be reset to 1. Additionally, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the condition `k` less than `s` should hold true.
State: **`k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is less than `s`**
