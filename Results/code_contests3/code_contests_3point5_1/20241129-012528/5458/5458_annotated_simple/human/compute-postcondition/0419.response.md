According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, the conditions for the loop to execute another time are that `j` is currently at a value less than `m`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `j` is now equal to 1.
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` remain the same, for the loop to execute another time `i` is less than `n`**
