Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `j=3`, `k`, `i` are integers obtained by splitting the input string where `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is within the range from 1 to s inclusive. If i == 0, then the condition (j >= k) is true and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0, the state of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is the remainder of the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] divided by mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] remains unchanged.***
