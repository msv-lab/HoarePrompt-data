Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` needs to be updated, `i` needs to be updated based on the conditions of the if-else block, `j` needs to be updated, and `dp` is updated accordingly for the next iteration to execute.
Output State: **`k` needs to be updated, `i` needs to be updated based on the conditions of the if-else block, `j` needs to be updated, and `dp` is updated accordingly for the next iteration to execute**
