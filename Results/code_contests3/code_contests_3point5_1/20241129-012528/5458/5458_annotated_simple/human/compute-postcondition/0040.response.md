Output State: **At the end of the loop, `N, M, S` remain positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split. The `dp` 2D list will have updated values based on the loop's execution logic.**
