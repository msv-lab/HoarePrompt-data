Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, the variables have the following state: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, and `j >= k`. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains as 1 if `j >= k` is true. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` for `j > k`.***
