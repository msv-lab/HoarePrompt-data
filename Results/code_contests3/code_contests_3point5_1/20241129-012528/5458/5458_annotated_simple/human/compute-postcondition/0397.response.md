Postcondition: ***`s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `i` equals 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, the program continues with the updated values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the comparison of `j` and `k`.***
