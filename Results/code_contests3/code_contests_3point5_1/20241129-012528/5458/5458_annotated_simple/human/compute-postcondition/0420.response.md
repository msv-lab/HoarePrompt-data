According to the given code, the loop will execute `s` times, where `s` is the value of the variable `s`. The loop variable `k` will take on values from 1 to `s` inclusive. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute another time `i` is less than `n`**
