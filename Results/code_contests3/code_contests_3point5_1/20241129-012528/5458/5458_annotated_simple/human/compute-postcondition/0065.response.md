Output State: **`N, M, S` are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `s` must be greater than 2, `k` must be 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
