Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string, `i+1` is an integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0. If j is greater than or equal to k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
