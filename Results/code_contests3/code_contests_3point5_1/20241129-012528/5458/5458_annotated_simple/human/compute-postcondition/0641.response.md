Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
