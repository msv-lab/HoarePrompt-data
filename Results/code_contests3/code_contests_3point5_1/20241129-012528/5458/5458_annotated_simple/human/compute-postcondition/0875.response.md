Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The updated values of `k` and `s` are greater than their current values. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, and the loop continues executing.
Output State: **`k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, and the loop continues executing**
