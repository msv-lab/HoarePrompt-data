According to the code, the loop can execute if n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, N, M, S are positive integers, so no need to adjust them. The loop can execute if n is at least 1, so we need to adjust n to be 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute the first time, i should be 0.
State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, n is 1, m, s are assigned the values obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0**
