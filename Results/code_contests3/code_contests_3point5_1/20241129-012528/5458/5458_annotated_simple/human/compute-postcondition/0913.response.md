Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k**
