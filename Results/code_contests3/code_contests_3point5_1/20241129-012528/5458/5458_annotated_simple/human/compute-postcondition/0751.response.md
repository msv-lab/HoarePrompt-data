Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. If `i` is 0, the condition checks if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, if true, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` remain unchanged. If `i` is not 0, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` remain unchanged.***
