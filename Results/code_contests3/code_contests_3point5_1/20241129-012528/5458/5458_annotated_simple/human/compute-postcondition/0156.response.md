According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as k is less than or equal to s. At the end of the last iteration, k was 1, and s is positive. So for the loop to execute one more time, k needs to be increased by 1.
State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+2 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 2 for the loop to execute the second time.**
