Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the new calculated value and the program continues the loop or execution.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the new calculated value and the program continues the loop or execution.**
