Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `j=3`, `k` are integers obtained by splitting the input string where `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is within the range from 1 to s inclusive, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0. The state of the variables `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`, and the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged.**
