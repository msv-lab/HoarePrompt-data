Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` are integers within the range of 1 to `s`, `i` is 0, dp[1][1][0] is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program maintains the initial state described in the precondition. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated according to the provided calculation.***
