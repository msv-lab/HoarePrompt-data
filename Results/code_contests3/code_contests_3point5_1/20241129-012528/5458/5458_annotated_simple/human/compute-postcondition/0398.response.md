According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is incremented by 1**
