Example Answer: 
If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged if `j` is greater than `k`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as described.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` remain unchanged if `j` is greater than `k`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.**
