Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. `k` is updated to a value greater than the current value as `s + 1`. Since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`**
