According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, so `s` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string, and `i+1` is an integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` needs to be 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer obtained by splitting the input string, `i+1` is an integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
