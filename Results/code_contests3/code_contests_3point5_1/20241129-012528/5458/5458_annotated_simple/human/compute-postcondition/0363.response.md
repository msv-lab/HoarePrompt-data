Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values of all variables are known. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, mod, n, m, s are 2; j, k are 1; i is not equal to 0; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **N, M, S, mod, n, m, s are 2; j, k are 1; i is not equal to 0; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
