Postcondition: ***`k` is `s + 1`, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `k` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `s` is updated to a value greater than the current value, `i`, `m`, `j` remain unchanged for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is not equal to 0, and the loop continues executing.***
