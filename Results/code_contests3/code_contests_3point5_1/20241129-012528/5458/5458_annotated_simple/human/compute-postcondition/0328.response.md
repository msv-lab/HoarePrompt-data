Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` are all 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, all variables remain the same and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables and the loop proceeds.***
