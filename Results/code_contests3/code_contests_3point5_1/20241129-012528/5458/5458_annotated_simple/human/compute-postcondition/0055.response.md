According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 1, and `k` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be 2.
State: **`N, M, S` are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `s` must be greater than 1, `k` must be 2**
