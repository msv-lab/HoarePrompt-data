Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: No changes in the state of variables.
Output State: **No changes in the state of variables**
