Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and then it is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not specified in the initial state, so the exact values of the variables cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous values of dp, j, and k.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the previous values of dp, j, and k**
