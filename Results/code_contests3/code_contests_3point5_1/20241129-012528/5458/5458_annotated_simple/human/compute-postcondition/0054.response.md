Postcondition: ***`N, M, S` are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, `mod` is assigned the value 100000, `n` is 1, `m, s` are assigned the values obtained from the input split, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. If i == 0, then if j >= k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1. If i is not equal to 0 and j > k, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is performed.***
