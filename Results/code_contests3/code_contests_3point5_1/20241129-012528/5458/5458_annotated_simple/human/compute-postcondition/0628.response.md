According to the code, the loop can execute if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from the input string, but it does not guarantee that the loop will execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
