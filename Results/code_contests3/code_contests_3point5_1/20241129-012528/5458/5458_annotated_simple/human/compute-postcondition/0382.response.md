Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` remain the same. If `i == 0`, and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Moreover, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.***
