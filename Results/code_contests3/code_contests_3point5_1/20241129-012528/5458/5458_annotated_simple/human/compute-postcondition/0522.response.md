Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp` is an integer with a specific value. Additionally, when the if condition i == 0 is met, all variables retain their initial state but `i` is now equal to 0.***
