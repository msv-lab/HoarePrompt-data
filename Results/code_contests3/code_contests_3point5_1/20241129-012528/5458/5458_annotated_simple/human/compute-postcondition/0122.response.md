Postcondition: ***All variables `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+1, k` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the existing positive integer values of the variables. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. After execution, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. The loop continues without affecting the variables.***
