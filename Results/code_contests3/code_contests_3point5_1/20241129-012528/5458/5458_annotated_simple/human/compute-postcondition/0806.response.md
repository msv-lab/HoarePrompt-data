Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, where `mod` is a predefined constant. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: *`k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k*. 
Output State: **`k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute the next time `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`**
