Postcondition: ***`N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 1`, for the loop to execute `s` is at least 1. `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1. Otherwise, `N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j is m+1, k is 1`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.***
