Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, and the assignment operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been executed.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string. `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0, and the assignment operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` has been executed.**
