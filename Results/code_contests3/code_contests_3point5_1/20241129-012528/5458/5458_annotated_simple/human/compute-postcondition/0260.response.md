Example Answer:
The code updates the dp array such that dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] if j >= k. The loop will execute again as k is incremented by 1. 
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j+m`, `k+s`, `i`, `j`, `k` are positive integers. dp array is updated as described above. `k` is incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again.**
