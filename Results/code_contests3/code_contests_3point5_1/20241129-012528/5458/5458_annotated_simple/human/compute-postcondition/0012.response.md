Output State: **N, M, S are positive integers such that 1 <= N <= 7, 1 <= M <= 2000, 1 <= S <= 3000, mod is assigned the value 100000, n is 1, m, s are assigned the values obtained from the input split, dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros with dimensions (m + 2) x (s + 1) x 2, for the loop to execute the first time i is 0, j is 1, k is 1. Additionally, the value of i is 0. After entering the if condition (j >= k), the program state remains the same. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
