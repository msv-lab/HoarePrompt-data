According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, there is no guarantee that the loop will execute, so adjustments need to be made to ensure the loop can run. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is 1, `k` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, for the loop to execute `n` is greater than 0**
