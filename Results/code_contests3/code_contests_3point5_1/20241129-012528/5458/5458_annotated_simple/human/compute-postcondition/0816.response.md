Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: No change in program state.
Output State: **No change in program state**
