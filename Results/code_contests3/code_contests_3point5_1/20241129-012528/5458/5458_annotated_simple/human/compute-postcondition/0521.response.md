According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` ranges from 1 to `s` inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n`, and `k` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **At the end of the loop, `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n`, `dp` is an integer with a specific value**
