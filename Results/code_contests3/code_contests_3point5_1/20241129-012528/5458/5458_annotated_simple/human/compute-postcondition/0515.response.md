Example Answer:
The calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is performed first, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is executed. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within their specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated according to the provided calculation.
Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated according to the provided calculation**
