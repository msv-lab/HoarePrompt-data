Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. If `j` is greater than `k`, no change occurs in any variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers**
