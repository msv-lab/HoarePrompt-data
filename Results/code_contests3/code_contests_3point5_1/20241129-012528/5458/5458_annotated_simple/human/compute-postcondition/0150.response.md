Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known, so the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k.
Output State: **All variables N, M, S, mod, n, m, s, j+2, k+1 are positive integers, s is greater than or equal to 1, k is 1 for the loop to execute the first time. i is not equal to 0. j is greater than k**
