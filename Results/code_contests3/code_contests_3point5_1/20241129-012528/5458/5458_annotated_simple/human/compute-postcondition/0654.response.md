Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `k`. The modulo operation has been applied to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are integers obtained by splitting the input string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` will be 2 if i is 0 otherwise j will be 1, `s` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation**
