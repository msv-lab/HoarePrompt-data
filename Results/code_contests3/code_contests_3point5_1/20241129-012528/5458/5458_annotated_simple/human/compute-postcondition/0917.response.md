Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly mentioned, so the output state is: `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k.
Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `i` is an integer, `j >= k**
