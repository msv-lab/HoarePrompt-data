Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. If `k` was less than or equal to `s` before the if statement, it may have been increased by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues execution with the updated values. Otherwise, the program proceeds with the existing values of the variables.***
