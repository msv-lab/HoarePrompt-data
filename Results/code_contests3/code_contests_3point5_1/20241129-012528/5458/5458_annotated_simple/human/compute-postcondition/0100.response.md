Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected in this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` are all integers, `m+1` is the value of `N`, `k+1` is the next value of `k`.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k+1` are all integers, `m+1` is the value of `N`, `k+1` is the next value of `k`**
