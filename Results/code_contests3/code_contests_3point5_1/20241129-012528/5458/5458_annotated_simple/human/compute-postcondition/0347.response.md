Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `dp` array are all integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the dp array is updated at index [1][2][1] with value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, no changes are made to the dp array and `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, `k` remain 1. For the loop to execute another time, `k` should be 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the dp array at index [1][2][1] is updated with value 1 and `k` is set to 2. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
