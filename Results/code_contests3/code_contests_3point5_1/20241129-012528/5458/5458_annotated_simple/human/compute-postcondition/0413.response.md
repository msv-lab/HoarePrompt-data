Output State: **`s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater or equal to the new `k`. The program continues its execution with the updated values. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
