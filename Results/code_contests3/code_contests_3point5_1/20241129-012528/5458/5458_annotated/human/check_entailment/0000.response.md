Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads the input values of N, M, and S, and then uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created. The program ensures that the conditions specified in the problem description are met, such as the arrangement of integers in ascending order in each column, and the uniqueness of each card. It outputs the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000, as required. Overall, the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for each given input.
