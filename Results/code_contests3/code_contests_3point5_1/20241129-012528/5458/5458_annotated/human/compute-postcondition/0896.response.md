According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to s inclusive. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted. Since `j` is m + 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be m + 2.
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to s inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values**
