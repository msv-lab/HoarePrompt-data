According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `m + 1`, and all other variables remain within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0**.
