Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are variables to be modified based on the conditions in the code. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The state of the variables remains unchanged otherwise.**
