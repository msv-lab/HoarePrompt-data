Example Answer: 
The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop and jump to the next iteration. Since there is no loop mentioned in the provided code snippet, the `continue` statement has no effect on the program. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on conditions, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on conditions, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before**
