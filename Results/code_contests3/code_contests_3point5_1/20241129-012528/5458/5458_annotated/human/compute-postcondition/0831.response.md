According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0 and `k`, `m`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values. 
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0**
