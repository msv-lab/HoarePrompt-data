Example Answer:
If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remains unchanged. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged**
