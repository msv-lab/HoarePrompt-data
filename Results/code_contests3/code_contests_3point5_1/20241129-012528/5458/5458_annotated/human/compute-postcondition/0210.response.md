Since the loop is iterating over `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. The final values of `j` and `m` will be equal to `m`. For the loop to execute the next time, `m` is at least 1 and `i` is incremented by 1**.
