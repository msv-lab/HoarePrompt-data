According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n**2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers and i is less than n**2. For the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated based on the calculations in the else part**
