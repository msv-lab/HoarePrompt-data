Output State: **After the if else block executes, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0. If `j > k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
