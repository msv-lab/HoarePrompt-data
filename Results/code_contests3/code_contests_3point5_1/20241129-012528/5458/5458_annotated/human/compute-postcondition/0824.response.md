Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to the remainder of the division of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, and `j` remain the same. If `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change in the program state. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated based on the given conditions, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` remain the same.
Output State: **`k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated based on the given conditions, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` remain the same**
