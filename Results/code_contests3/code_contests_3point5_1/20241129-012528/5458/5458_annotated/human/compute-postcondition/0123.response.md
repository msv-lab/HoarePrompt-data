According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `k`, `i`, `s`. 
For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. 
If `i` is equal to 0, then for the loop to execute again, `j` must be greater than or equal to `k`. 
If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod. 
So for the loop to be executed one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i`, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before**
