According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 20, `i` is 0, and `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value, which is 20.
State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 21, `i` is 0, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop**
