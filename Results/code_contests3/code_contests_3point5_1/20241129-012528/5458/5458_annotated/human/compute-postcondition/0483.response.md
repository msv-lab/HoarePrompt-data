Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0. If `i` is equal to 0, then dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program maintains the mentioned state. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k` are 1, `i` is 0. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] if j > k. Otherwise, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] modulo mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
