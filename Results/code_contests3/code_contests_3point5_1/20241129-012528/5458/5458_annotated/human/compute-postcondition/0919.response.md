According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`. 

If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0`, the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is retained. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`.**
