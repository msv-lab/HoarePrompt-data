According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and `s` should be adjusted accordingly to accommodate this change. 
State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`**
