Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the variable `dp` at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` remain the same.***
