According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, the adjusted state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on input values where `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0**
