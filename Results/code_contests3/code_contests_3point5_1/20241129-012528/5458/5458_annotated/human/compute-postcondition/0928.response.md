Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. The final state of the loop will result in the values of `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` being m + 2, and `s` being within the range of the input values. The values of the variables will be updated based on the conditions within the loop and the ranges specified.**
