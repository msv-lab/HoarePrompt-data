Postcondition: ***`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 21, `i` is 0, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, no changes occur in the variables `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `dp`. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `dp` are updated based on the calculations within the loop.***
