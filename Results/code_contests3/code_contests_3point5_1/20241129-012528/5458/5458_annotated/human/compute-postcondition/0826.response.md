Postcondition: ***`k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated based on the given conditions, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` remain the same. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` >= `k`, the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated, and the program state remains unchanged.***
