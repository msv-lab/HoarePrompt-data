Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s**
