Output State: **After entering the if block, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, and `i` is not equal to 0. In addition, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
