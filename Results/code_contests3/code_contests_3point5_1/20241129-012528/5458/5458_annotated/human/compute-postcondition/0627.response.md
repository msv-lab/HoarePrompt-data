According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `n ** 2`. Before the loop starts, the final calculated value of `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside, so the adjustment needed for the loop to execute is that `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
