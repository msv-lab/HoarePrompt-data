Output State: **n, m, s, k are greater than 0, s, k, i+1, j are integers. if j > k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The loop or if statement continues as we were directly inside it. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
