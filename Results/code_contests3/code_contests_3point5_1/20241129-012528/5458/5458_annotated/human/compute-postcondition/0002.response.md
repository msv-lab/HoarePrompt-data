Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Since the values are integers, the variables will hold the respective integer values. The values of N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **N, M, and S are positive integers within the specified ranges**
