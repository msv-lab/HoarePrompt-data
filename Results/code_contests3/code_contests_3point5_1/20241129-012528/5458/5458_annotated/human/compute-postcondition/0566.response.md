Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` reflects the updated value for the previous iteration. For the loop to execute, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
