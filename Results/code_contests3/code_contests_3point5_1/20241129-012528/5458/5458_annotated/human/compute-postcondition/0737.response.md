Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, when the if condition (j > k) is true, `j` is greater than `k`.
