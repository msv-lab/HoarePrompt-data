Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` inclusive. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or condition.***
