According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged. If i == 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If i != 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged if j > k.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop is iterating over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, for the next iteration, `k` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged. If i == 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If i != 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute i more time `k` should be `k+1`.**
