Output State: **`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0. The final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on the loop execution. The final values of `dp` are dependent on the calculations within the loop and the conditions met during each iteration.**
