Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. `j` is 3, `m` is 3, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and the conditions related to `i`, `j`, and `dp` as described above are satisfied. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
