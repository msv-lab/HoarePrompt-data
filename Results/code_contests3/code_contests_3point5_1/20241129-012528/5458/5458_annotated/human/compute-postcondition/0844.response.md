According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, as long as it stays within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive.
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` inclusive**
