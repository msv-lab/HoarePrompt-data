Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. The final values of `j` and `m` will be equal to `m`. The final values in the `dp` array will depend on the comparisons of `i`, `j`, and `k` at each iteration, along with the operations specified in the loop code.**
