Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the specified ranges. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2**
