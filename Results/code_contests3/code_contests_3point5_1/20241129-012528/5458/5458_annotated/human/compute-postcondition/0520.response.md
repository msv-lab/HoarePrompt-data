According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers does not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n`, `m` is greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations in the else part.
State: **`n`, `m` is greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations in the else part, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
