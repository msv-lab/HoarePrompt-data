Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0**
