Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain the same, the only change is in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` where 1 is assigned. Therefore, the Output State is: After the if else block, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2 and `m` unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.
Output State: **After the if else block, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2 and `m` unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1**
