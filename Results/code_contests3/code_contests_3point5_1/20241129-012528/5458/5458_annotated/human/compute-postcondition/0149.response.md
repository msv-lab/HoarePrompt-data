Postcondition: ***After the else block, the values of variables `i`, `j` is 2, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2, `m` remains the same, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The condition `i == 0` is false. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.***
