Output State: **`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is the current value of `s + 1`. If j >= k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. After the if else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
