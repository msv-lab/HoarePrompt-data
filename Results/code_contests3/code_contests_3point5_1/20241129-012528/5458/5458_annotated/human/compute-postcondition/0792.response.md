Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to execute without affecting any variables. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
