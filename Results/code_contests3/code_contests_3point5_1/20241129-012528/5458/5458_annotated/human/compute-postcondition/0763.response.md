According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are `dp`, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, and `j` to ensure k is within the range of 1 to s. Additionally, since k is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to the starting value of the loop range which is 1.
State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
