Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. For the first execution of the loop, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` are m + 2, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the `dp` array at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.***
