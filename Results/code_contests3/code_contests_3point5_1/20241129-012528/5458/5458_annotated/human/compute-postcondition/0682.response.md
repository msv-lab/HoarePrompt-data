Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on input values where `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j > k`. The value of `k` is incremented by 1 to allow for another loop iteration.**
