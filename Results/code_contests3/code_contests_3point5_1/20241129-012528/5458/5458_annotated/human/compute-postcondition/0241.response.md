Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `m` is at least 1. Initially, dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1. After the execution of the if else block, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k] remains 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated based on the given conditions. If `j` is greater than `k`, dp[i + 2 & 1][j + 1][k] is set to 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] is updated to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
