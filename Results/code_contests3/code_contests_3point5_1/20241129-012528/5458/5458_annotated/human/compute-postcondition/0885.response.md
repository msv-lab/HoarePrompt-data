Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
