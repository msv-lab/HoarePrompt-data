Postcondition: ***`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 3, `i` is 8, `dp` is updated, `s` is greater than 0. If i == 0, then the state remains the same. If i != 0, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `dp` are all updated. `s` remains greater than 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its original value, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
