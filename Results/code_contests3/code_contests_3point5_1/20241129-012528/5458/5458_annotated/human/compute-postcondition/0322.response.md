Output State: **Output is the result of the modulo operation on the element located at index `n`, `m` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.**
