Output State: **`k, dp, i, k, s, m, s, n, j` are within the range of 1 to `s, m, s, n, j` is less than `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`. After the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j > k`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
