Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The initial values of the variables are n=10, m=5, j=7, s=20, k=21, i=0. Since there is no loop, the values of the variables remain the same after the execution of this code snippet.
Output State: **n is 10, m is 5, j is 7, s is 20, k is 21, i is 0, dp is updated based on the calculations within the loop.**
