Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: *`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: ***`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`***
