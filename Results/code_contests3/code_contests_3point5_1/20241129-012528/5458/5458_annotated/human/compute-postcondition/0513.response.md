Postcondition: ***n, m, s, k are integers incremented by 1, i is 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 for the loop to execute the next time. If j > k, the variables remain incremented by 1 and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] remains assigned the value 1. If j >= k, all variables remain unchanged.***
