According to the loop statement, the loop will execute for the next iteration if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the last value used in the loop, and `m` is the upper limit. To continue the loop for one more iteration, `j` needs to be adjusted to a value that is less than `m`.
State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s` are integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`**
