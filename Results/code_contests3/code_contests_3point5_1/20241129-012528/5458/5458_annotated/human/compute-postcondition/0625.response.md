Postcondition: ***The final calculated value of `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables and no further action is taken.***
