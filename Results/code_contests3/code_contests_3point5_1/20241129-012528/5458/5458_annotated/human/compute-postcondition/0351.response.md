According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the final values are as follows:
`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 5, `s` is 20, `k` is 3, `i` is 8, `dp` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, the next iteration would have:
State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 3, `i` is 8, `dp` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**
