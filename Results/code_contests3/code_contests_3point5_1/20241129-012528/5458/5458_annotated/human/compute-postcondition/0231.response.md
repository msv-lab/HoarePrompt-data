Example Answer:
The code updates the value at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo operation of the value at index `[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are used in the calculation, but their exact values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k`, `m` are integers.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k`, `m` are integers**
