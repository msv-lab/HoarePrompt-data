Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers.
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers**
