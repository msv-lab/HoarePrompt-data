Output State: **`k`, `dp`, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` are within the range of 1 to s, m, s, n, j is less than m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` > `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**
