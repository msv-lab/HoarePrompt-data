According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is within the range of 1 to s. Therefore, before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are: k is 1, dp, i, s, m, n, j are within the range of 1 to s, m, s, n, j is less than m + 1.
State: **k is 1, dp, i, k, s, m, s, n, j are within the range of 1 to s, m, s, n, j is less than m + 1, for the loop to execute the first time**
