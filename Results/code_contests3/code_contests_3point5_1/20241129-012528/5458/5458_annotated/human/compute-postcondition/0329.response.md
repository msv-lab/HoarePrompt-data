Output State: **Output is the result of the modulo operation on the element located at index `n`, `m` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
