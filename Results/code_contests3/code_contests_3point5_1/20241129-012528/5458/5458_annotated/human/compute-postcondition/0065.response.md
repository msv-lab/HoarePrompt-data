Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `i`, `j` are integers, `k` is the next integer after the previous iteration to satisfy the condition `k < s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`i`, `j` are integers, `k` is the next integer after the previous iteration to satisfy the condition `k < s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
