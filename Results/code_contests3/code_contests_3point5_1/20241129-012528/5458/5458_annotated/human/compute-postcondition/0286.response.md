Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0. `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. Upon the condition that `j > k` is satisfied, this postcondition holds true.***
