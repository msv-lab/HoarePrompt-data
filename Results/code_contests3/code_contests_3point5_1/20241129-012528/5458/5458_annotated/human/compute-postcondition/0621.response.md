Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` and prints the result. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the loop iterations and conditions for each value of `k`. Therefore, the final output state after all iterations is based on the calculated value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`.
Output State: **The final calculated value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`**
