Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by taking the modulo of the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with respect to `mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, but the operation is performed based on those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, then the overall state of the program is as described.
