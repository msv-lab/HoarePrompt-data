According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. 
If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which allows the loop to continue. 
If `i` is not 0, the loop will continue if `j` is greater than `k`. 
At the end of the last iteration, the variables are `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and `i`.
To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`**
