According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` are all 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1. After the execution of the if else block, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. Otherwise, if `j` is not greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k, i` are all 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`**
