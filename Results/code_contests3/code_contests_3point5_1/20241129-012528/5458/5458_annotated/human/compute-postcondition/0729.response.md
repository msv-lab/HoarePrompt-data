According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`, `n`, and `s`. Since `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, the loop will execute. The final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` will depend on the loop execution. The final values of `dp` will be determined by the calculations and conditions met during each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, for the loop to execute `j` is in the range of 1 to `m`**
