According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. The final values of `j` and `m` will be equal to `m`. For the loop to execute the next time, `m` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is equal to 0, the conditions remain unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
State: **At the end of the iteration, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. `j` is equal to `m`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `j` is greater than `k`.**
