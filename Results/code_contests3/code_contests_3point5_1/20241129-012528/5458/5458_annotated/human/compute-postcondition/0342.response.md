Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i`, `j`, `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Output is the result of the modulo operation on the element located at index `n`, `m` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is either assigned the value 1 or incremented based on the conditions provided.
