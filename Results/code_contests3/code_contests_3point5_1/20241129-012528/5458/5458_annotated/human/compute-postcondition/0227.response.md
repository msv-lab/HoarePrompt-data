Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The states of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be greater than `k`, for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 1.
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` should be greater than `k`, for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 1**
