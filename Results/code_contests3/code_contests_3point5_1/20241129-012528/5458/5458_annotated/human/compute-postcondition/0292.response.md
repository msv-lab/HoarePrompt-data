Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the conditions for the if and else statements are met as described above.***
