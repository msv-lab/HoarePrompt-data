Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` reflects the updated value for the previous iteration, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. When the if condition `i == 0` is met, it signifies that the program is in the initial state of iteration***
