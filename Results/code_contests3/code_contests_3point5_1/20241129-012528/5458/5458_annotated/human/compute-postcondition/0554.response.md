According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, so they do not need to be adjusted. Since the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` has been updated based on the calculations in the loop code for the current iteration, it needs to be adjusted to reflect the updated value for the previous iteration.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` reflects the updated value for the previous iteration, for the loop to execute `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`**.
