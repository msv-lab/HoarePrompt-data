According to the code, the loop can execute if `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.**
