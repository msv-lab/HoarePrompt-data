Example Answer:
The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the remainder of the division of the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The values of `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, and `k` remain the same if `j` is not greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, otherwise, the values remain the same.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, otherwise, the values remain the same.**
