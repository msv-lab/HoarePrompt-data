Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` remain 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
