Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute, `s` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0, then `i` is updated to 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is not 0 and `s` is greater than 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
