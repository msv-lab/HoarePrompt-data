Postcondition: ***After the if else block, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2 and `m` unchanged. For the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `i == 0`, then the value of `i` is 0, `j >= k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. If `i != 0`, the value of `i` remains 2, `j > k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
