According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **At the end of the loop, the variables `dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m + 1**
