Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the state of the program variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, no change occurs in the variables, but the loop or statement proceeds to the next iteration.***
