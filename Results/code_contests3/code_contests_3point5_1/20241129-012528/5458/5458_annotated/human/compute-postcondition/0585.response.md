Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` have been updated based on the calculations in the loop code for all iterations. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
