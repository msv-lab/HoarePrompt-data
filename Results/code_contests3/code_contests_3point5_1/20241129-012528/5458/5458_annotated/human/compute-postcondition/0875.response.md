Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The previous values are maintained within the specified ranges. After execution, the new state will have `dp`, `i+1`, `j` as m + 1, `k` as 1, and the loop will continue with the updated `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` value.
Output State: **After the if block, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with the updated value.**
