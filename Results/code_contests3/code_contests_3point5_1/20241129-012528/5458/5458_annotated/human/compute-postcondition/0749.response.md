Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. `j` is within the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values of the variables remain unchanged and the program proceeds to the next iteration. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
