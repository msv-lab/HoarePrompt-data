Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, and `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` are maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, the states of these variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`**
