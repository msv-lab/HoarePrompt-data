According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `m`. 
State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`**
