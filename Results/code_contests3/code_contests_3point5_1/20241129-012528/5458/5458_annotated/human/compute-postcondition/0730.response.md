According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the value of `k` is in the range of 1 to `s + 1`. Before the loop starts, the values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, to ensure the loop executes, `j` needs to be set to a value within the range of 1 to `m`.
State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute**
