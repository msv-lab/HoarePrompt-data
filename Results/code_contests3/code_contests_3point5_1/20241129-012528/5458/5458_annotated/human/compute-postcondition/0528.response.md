Example Answer:
The value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. The loop will execute the first time with j = 1. Since the else part is not mentioned and no other variables are affected, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] remains the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, s, k are greater than 0, s, k, i+1, j are integers, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].
Output State: **n, m, s, k are greater than 0, s, k, i+1, j are integers, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is equal to dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
