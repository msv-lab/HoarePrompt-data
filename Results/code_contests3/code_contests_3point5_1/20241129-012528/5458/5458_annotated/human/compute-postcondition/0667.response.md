Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is dependent on input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0. The final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on the loop execution. The final values of `dp` are dependent on calculations within the loop and conditions met during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the final value of `j` must be incremented by 1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0***
