Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are all incremented by 1. `i` is set to 0. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
