Postcondition: ***The values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. `j` is 3, `m` is 3. For the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1. When the if condition `i == 0` is true, then `i` equals 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k`***
