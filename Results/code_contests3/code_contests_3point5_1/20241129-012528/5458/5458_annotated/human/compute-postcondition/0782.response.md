Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are not affected by this operation. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will execute the second time with `k` being 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` are within the specified ranges. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will execute the second time with `k` being 2.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` are within the specified ranges. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will execute the second time with `k` being 2**
