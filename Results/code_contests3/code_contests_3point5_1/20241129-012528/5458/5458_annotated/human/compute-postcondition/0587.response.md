According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, it is given that `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0 and `j` is less than `m`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` values are updated. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be greater than 0 and `k` should be 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` values are updated, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1**
