Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables remain the same as before. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 2, `i` is 8, `dp` is updated, `s` is greater than 0, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `k` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a new value based on the else part condition.
Output State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 2, `i` is 8, `dp` is updated, `s` is greater than 0, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `k` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a new value based on the else part condition.**
