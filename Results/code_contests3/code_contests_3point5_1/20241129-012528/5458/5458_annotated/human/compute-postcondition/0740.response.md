Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known, so the output state can be calculated based on those values. 
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no change occurs in the variables, but the loop or statement proceeds to the next iteration.**
