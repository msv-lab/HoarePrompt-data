Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The final values of `i`, `j`, `k` and `dp` are dependent on the loop execution and conditions met during each iteration, making it difficult to determine exact values without more context on the loop structure and initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: Final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on loop execution. Final values of `dp` are calculated based on the provided code snippet and conditions met during each iteration.
Output State: **Final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on loop execution. Final values of `dp` are calculated based on the provided code snippet and conditions met during each iteration.**
