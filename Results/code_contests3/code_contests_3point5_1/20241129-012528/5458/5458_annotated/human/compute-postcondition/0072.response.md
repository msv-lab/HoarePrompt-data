Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `k` is the next integer after the previous iteration to satisfy the condition `k < s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation described in the else part.***
