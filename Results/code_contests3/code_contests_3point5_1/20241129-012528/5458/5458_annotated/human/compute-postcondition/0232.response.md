Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k`, `m` are integers. If `i` is equal to 0, then the function does nothing. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is greater than `k` for the loop to execute, and `m` must be at least 1. Additionally, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1.***
