According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of `1` to `s` inclusive. The initial state before the loop starts is `i`, `j` is 1, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` as before. Since `k` is the loop variable, it needs to be adjusted to `1` for the loop to execute. 
State: **`i`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before, for the loop to execute again `j` is 1**
