Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`**
