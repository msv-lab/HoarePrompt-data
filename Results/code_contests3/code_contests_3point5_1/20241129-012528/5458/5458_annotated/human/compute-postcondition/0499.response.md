According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and the condition involving `i`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 for the loop to execute the next time**
