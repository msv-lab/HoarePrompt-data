According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the calculations in the loop code for each iteration. The loop will update the `dp` array based on the conditions provided in the if-else statements for each value of `k`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` has been updated based on the calculations in the loop code for the current iteration**
