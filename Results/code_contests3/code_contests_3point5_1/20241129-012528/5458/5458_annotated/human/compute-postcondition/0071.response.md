Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `k` remains the same. If `j` is initially greater than `k`, then `k` is updated to meet the condition `k < s + 1`, otherwise, there is no change. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation described.
Output State: **`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation described**
