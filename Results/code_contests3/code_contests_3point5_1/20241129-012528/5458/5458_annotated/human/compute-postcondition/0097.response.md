According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `S`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `k` by 1 and ensure that the conditions for the loop to continue are still satisfied. Therefore, the updated states should be:
State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. If `i == 0` and `j+1 >= k+2`, the loop will execute one more time**
