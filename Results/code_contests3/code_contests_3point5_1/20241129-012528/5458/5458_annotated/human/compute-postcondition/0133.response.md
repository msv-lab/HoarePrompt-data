Output State: **`i`, `j` are 1, `k` is updated according to the conditions specified, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before. If `j < k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[0][2][k]` is assigned the value 1**
