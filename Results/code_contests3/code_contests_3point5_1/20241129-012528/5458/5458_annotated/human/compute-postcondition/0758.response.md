Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`. `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` are maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change in the variables and the program continues execution. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
