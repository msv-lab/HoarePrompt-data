Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`. If `j >= k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the sum of the previous value and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Otherwise, the values remain the same.***
