Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 2][k]` reflects the updated value for the previous iteration. For the loop to execute, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. If `j > k`, there is no change in the variables, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
