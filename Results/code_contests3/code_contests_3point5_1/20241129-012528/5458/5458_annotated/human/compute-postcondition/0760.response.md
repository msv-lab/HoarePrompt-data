Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. If `i` is equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, in the else part, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
