Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, `i` are all integers. For the loop to execute a second time, `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 1. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0. The condition `j` is greater than or equal to `k` is true. After the execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k, i` are all 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula provided.***
