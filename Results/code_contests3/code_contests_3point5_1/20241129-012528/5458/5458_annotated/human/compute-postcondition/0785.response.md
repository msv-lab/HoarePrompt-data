According to the code, the loop depends on the variables `k`, `i`, `j`, and the conditions related to `dp`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`dp`, `i`, `j` remain within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time.**
