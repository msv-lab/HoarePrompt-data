Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values. If `i` is 0, when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with the updated value.***
