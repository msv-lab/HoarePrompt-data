Postcondition: ***All variables `i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. If `i == 0` and `j+1 >= k+2`, the loop will execute one more time. If `j >= k`, the loop condition is not met, so the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` does not affect any variable values. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
