Output State: `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` is 1, `m`, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After the code execution, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.
