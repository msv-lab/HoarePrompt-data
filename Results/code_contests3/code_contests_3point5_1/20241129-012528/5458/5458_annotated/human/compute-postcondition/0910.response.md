According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `s` are integers. For the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than or equal to `s+1`.
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, `k` is m + 3, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s+1`**
