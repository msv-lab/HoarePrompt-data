According to the code, the loop can execute for values of `j` ranging from 1 to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6 and `m` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and become 7, which is less than or equal to `m` which is 5.
State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 20, `i` is 8, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop, `s` is greater than 0**
