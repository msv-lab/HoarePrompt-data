According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`. If `s` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the loop, `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, `s` is greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.
