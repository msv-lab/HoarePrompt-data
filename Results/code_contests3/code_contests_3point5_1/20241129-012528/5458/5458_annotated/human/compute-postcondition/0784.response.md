Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2. If `i == 0`, then if `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] = 1`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. In the else part, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` if `j` is greater than `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will execute the second time with `k` being 2.***
