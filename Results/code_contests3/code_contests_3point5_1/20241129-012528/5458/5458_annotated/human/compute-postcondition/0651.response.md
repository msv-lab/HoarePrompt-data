According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variable `k` and `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the current value of `s - 1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be updated to the next value in the range of `1` to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `k` should be `current value of k + 1`.
State: *`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is the current value of `s`. If j >= k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. After the if else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`
