Postcondition: ***`i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before, for the loop to execute again `j` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is incremented by the value of dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
