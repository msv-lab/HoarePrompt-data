According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k`, `s`, and the conditions inside the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is the current value of `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop will not execute again. Otherwise, the loop will execute one more time.

State: **`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is the current value of `s - 1**.
