According to the code, the loop will execute `s` times where `s` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than 0. 

Before the loop starts, `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1. 

So, for the loop to execute the first time:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than 0**
