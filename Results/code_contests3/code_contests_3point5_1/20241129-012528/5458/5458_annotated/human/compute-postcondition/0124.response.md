Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i` and `j` are both 1, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 0, `j + 1` becomes 2, and `k` remains the updated value based on the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is updated, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s` are as before, and `dp[0][2][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is updated, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s` are as before, `dp[0][2][k]` is assigned the value 1**
