Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`. After executing the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` divided by `mod`.**
