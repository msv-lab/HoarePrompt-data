Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the input range, `s` is greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0**
