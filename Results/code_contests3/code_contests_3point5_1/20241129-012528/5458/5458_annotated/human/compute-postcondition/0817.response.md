Postcondition: ***`k, dp, i, k, s, m, s, n, j` are within the range of 1 to `s, m, s, n, j` is less than `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i != 0` and `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
