Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0. `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned as 1.***
