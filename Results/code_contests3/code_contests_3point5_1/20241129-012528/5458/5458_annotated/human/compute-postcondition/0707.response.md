Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` is 1, `m`, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated as follows: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is incremented by this sum.***
