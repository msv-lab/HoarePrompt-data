Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` values are updated. For the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.***
