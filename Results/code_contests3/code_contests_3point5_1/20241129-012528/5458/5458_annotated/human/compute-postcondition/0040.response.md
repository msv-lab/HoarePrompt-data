Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` will be modified based on the conditions specified in the loop code. The final values of the variables will depend on the execution path taken by the conditional statements within the loop. The final state will be determined by the outcome of the logical conditions and the calculations performed on the variables during each iteration of the loop.**
