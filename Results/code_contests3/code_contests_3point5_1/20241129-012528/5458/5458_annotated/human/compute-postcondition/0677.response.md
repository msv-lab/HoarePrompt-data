Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on input values where `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0. The final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on the loop execution. The final values of `dp` are dependent on calculations within the loop and conditions met during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented by 1, and after the if condition `j >= k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
