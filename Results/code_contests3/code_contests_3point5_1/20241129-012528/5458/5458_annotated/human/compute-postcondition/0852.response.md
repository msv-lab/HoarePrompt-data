Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` inclusive. If `i` is equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables and the loop or if statement continues execution. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
