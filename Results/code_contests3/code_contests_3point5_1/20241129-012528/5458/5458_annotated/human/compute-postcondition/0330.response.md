Output State: **Output is the result of the modulo operation on the element located at index `n`, `m` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the modulo operation of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
