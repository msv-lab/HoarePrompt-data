Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, updated values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. After running the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`.**
