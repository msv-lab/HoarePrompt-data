Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on input values where `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0. The final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on the loop execution. The final values of `dp` are dependent on calculations within the loop and conditions met during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` should be updated based on conditions in the loop. When `j >= k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on loop execution. Final values of `dp` are calculated based on the provided code snippet and conditions met during each iteration.***
