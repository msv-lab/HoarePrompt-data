Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i+1` and `j` are within the range of 1 to `m`, and `j` is greater than `k`, the values of the variables are maintained within the specified range. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i+1`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`**
