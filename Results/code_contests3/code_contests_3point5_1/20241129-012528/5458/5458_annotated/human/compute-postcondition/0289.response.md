Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation. Additionally, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. When the if condition is met (i == 0) and (j >= k), the state of the program variables is as described above. Otherwise, if the else condition is met, the state of the program variables is the same as described above, with the additional constraint that `j` must be greater than `k`.***
