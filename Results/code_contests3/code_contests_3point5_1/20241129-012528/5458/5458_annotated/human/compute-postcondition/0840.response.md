Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, no variables are affected, and the program continues without any changes.***
