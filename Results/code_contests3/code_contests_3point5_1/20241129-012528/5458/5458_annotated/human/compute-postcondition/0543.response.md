According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0. If `i == 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations in the else part or by `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j >= k`, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, where `mod` is a constant. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should still be less than or equal to `s`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time `k+1` must be less than or equal to `s**"
