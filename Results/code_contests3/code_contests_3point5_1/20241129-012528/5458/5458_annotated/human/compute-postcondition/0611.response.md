Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0. The variable `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then all variables remain integers greater than 0. The variable `j` is still less than `m`, and `k` has been incremented by 1. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 1.***
