Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, `m`, `n` remain the same. Since the value of `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` remain the same**
