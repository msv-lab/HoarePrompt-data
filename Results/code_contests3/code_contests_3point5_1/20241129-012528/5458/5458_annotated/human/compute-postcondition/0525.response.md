Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. Initially, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is 1. After the execution of the if else block, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations in the else part.***
