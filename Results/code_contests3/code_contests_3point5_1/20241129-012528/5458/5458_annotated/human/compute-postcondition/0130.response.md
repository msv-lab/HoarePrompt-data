Output State: **`i`, `j` are 1, `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
