According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range of 1 to m inclusive. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `i+1`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, but we need to adjust the value of `j` to be within the range 1 to m inclusive for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j` is within the range of 1 to m inclusive, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values for the loop to execute the first time**
