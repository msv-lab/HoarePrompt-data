Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, and `j+1` are integers greater than 0. `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues with updated values. The equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is applied. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
