Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` is 1, `m`, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute a second time.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` is 1, `m`, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute a second time**
