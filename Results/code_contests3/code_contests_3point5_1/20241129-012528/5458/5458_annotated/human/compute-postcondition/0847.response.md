Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` inclusive.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` inclusive**
