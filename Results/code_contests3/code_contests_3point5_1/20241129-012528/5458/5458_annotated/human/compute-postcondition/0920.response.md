Example Answer: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The values of `i + 1`, `j`, and `k` are integers, so the value of `dp` at the given indices is set to 1. The initial state of the variables remains the same.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to `k+1`. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
