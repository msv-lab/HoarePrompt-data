Postcondition: ***`j` is an integer incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` equals 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will continue executing, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the previous values of `dp`.***
