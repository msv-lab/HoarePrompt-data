According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is 20, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 3, `i` is 8, `dp` is updated, `s` is greater than 0, either `j` is greater than or equal to `k` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a new value based on the else part condition, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**.
