Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i` and `j` are both 1, and the value of `k` is updated based on the conditions mentioned earlier. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on conditions, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is updated based on conditions, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before**
