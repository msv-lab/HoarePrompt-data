Postcondition: ***`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 1, `i` is 8, `dp` is updated based on the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, `s` is greater than 0, and either `j` is greater than or equal to `k` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value based on the else part condition.***
