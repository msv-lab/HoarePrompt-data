According to the code, the `while 1` statement indicates an infinite loop. Therefore, the loop will execute indefinitely. Since it is a `while True` loop, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **N, M, and S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000; mod is 100000**
