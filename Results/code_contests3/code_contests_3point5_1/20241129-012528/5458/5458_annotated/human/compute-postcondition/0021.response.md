Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers within their respective ranges. If `i` equals 0, then if j >= k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` retains its value, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly by incrementing it with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
