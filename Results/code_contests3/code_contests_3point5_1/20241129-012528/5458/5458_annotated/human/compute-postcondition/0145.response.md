Postcondition: ***After all iterations of the loop, the values of variables `i`, `j` is 2, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2, `m` remains the same, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1. When the if condition `i == 0` is true, the value of `i` is 0, and all other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, when `j >= k`, the program state is such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
