Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `dp` remain unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation. Additionally, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. When the if condition is met (i == 0) and (j >= k), the state of the program variables is as described above.***
