Output State: **After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variables will have the following values: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations in the loop code for each iteration. The loop will update the `dp` array based on the conditions provided in the if-else statements for each value of `k`.**
