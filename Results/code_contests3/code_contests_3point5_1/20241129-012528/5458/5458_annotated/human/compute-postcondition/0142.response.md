According to the code, the loop depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` remains the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of variables `i`, `j` is 2, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2, `m` remains the same**
