According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and the condition `j >= k`. 

If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `i` is 0, then `j` is incremented by 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change to the program state.

At the end of the last iteration, the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `k` must satisfy the condition `k < s + 1`.

State: **`i`, `j` are integers, `k` is the next integer after the previous iteration to satisfy the condition `k < s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**.
