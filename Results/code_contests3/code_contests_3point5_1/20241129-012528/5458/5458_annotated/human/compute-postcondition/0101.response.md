Example Answer:
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the loop will execute one more time based on the condition, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers and the loop will execute one more time based on the condition.
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers and the loop will execute one more time based on the condition**
