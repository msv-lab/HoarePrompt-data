Postcondition: ***After the if else block, the values of variables `i`, `j` remain as 2, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged, with `j` being 2 and `m` staying the same. For the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. The condition `i == 0` is false. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
