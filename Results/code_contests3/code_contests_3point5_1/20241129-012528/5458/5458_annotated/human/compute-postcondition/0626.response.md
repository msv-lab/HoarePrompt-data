Example Answer:
A 2D list `dp` is created with dimensions determined by the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. Since all three variables are 0, the values of the variables do not change, and we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.
Output State: **The final calculated value of `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.**
