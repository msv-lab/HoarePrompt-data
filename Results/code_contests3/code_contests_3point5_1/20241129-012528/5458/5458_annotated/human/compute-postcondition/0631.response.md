Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. The loop executes the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. Additionally, after entering the if condition `i` is equal to 0. Also, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
