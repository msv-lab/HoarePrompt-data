Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j` are 1, `k` is updated according to the conditions specified, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before.
Output State: **`i`, `j` are 1, `k` is updated according to the conditions specified, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before**
