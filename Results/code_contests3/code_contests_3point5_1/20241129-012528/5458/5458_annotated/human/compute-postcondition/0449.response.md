Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k, i` are all 0. `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1` and `k` is less than or equal to `s`. After the execution of the if statement, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the program continues to the next iteration.**
