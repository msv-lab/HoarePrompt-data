Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the remainder of the division of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` by `mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the calculations in the else part or by `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `k` has been incremented by 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers. If `j > k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the calculations in the else part or by `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `k` has been incremented by 1. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`.**
