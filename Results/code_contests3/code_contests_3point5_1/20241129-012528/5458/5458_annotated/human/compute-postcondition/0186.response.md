Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. The values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop, `j` is 3, `m` is 3. For the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `j` is greater than `k`.
