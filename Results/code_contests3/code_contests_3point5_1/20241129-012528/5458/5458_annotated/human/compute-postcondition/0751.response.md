Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, `j` is within the range of 1 to `m`. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
