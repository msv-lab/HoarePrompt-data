Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, either `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m` or `i` is 0 and `j >= k. If `j > k`, the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to be the same as dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` divided by `mod`.**
