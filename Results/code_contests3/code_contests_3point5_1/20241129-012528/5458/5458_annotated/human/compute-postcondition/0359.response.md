Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 1, `i` is 8, `dp` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 1, `i` is 8, `dp` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for the loop to execute the first time, `s` is greater than 0, and `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`**
