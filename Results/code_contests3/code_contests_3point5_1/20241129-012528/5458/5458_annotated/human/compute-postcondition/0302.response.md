Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the conditions for the if and else statements are met.
