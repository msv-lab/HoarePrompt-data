Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged. If i == 0 and j > k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if j >= k. If i != 0 and j > k, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged, for the loop to execute i more time `k` should be `k+1`. If j <= k, the program continues to the next iteration without any changes. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Additionally, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.
