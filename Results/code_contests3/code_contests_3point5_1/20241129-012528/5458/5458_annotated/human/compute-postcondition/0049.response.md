Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`j` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time. `i` is not equal to 0. `j` is greater than `k`**
