Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The states of the other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. If `i == 0` and `j+1 >= k+2` and `j > k`, the loop will execute one more time based on the condition.**
