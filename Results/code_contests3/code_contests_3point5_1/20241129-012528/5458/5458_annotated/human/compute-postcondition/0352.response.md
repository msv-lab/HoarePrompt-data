According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `m` values are not relevant for the loop to execute. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `k` is now 1.
State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 6, `s` is 20, `k` is 1, `i` is 8, `dp` is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
