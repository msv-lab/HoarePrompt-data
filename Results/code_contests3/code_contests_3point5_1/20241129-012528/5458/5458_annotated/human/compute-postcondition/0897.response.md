According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` are m + 2, `k` is within the range of 1 to s inclusive. To ensure the loop executes, `k` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 2, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0**
