According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `k`, and `s`. If `j >= k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are integers incremented by 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Since `j >= k`, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the variables remain the same.
State: **n, m, s, k are integers incremented by 1, i is 0, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value 1 for the loop to execute the next time. If j >= k, the variables remain unchanged**
