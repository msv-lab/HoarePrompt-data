Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0. If `i == 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculations in the else part or by `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` if `j >= k`, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `i != 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`, where `mod` is a constant.***
