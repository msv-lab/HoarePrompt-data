Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `dp[i][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation if `i != 0`, `s` is greater than 0 after the execution of the if else block.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `dp[i][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation if `i != 0`, `s` is greater than 0 after the execution of the if else block**
