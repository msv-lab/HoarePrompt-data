Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is the current value of `s - 1. After the if else block executes, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
