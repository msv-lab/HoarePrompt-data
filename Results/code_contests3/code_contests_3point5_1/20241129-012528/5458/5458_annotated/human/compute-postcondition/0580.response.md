Example Answer:
The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged and we continue to the next iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain unchanged and we continue to the next iteration**
