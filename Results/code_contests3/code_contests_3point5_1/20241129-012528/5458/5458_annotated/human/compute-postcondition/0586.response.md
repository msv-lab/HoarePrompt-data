According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m`, all other variables are integers greater than 0. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m + 1`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` values are updated**
