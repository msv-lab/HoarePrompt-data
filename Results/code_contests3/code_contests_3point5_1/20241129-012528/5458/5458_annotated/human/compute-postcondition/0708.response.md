According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k` is 1, `m`, `s` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Update `k` to be the next value in the xrange, so `k + 1`.
- Update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the conditions provided in the code snippet.

State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1` is 1, `m`, `s` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute a second time**.
