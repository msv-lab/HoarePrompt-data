Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment takes place. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop.
Output State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop**
