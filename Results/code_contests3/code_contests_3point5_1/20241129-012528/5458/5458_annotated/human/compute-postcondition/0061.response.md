Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The loop will execute as long as `j` > `k` and `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so the final output state after this operation is not determinable.
Output State: **Indeterminable**
