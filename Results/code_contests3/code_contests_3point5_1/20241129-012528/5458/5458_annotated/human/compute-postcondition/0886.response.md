According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `s` must be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **After the if else block executes, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `s` is greater than 0**
