Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` if `j > k`. The initial values are provided as `n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k, i` are 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k, i` are 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k, i` are 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the condition**
