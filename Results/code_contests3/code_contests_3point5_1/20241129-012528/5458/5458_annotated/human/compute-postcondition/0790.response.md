Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `j`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `s` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to execute without affecting any variables. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
