Postcondition: ***At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, `j` is less than or equal to `m`, and the conditions for the if and else statements are met. If `j > k`, the program retains the same state as the precondition.***
