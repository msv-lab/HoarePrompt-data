Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1` remain unchanged, and `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain the same and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1`, `updated dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` remain the same and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1**
