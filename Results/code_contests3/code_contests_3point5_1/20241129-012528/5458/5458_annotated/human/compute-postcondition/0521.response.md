According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If s is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n, m, s, k, i+1, j are already greater than 0 and integers, and dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated based on calculations in the else part. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be 1. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations in the else part, and `j` is 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k` are greater than 0, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j` are integers, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the calculations in the else part, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
