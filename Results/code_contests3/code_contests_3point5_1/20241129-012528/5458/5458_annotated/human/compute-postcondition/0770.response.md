Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since the condition `(i == 0)` is false, and `j` is greater than `k`, this assignment takes place. The values of `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` remain the same, assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` = `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is made**
