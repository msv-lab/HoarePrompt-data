Output State: **After the if else block executes, `dp`, `i+1`, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute the second time `s` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, so the state after execution remains the same.**
