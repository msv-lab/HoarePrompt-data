Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the 3D array `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to access the specific element in the array, with `i + 1` and `j + 1` representing the updated indices. Since `k` is 2 for the loop to execute the second time, the value 1 is assigned to the element at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` in the array `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] = 1`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] = 1**
