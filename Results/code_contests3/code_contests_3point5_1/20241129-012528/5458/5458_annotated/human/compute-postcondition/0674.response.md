Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on input values where `n`, `m`, `s` are greater than 0. The final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on the loop execution. The final values of `dp` are dependent on calculations within the loop and conditions met during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the final value of `j` must be incremented by 1. After entering the if condition where `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. After this assignment, the program state is determined by the specified conditions and calculations. If the if condition is not met, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on calculations.***
