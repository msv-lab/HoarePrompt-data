According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k, s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`k, dp, i, k, s, m, s, n, j are within the range of 1 to s, m, s, n, j is less than m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is within the range of 1 to s+1**
