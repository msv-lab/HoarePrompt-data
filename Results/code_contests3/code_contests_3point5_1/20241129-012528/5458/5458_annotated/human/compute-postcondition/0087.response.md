Postcondition: ***`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j >= k`, then the loop will execute one more time. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated as the modulus of the previous value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` with `mod`.***
