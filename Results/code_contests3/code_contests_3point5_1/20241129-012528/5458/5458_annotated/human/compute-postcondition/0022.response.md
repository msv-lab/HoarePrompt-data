According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`, `j`, and `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i` are positive integers, and if `i` equals 0, then the conditions for updating `dp` are checked based on the values of `j` and `k`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` needs to be modified based on the conditions specified in the code**
