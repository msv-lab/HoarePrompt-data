Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, so we can't determine the exact values. Therefore, the Output State is: After the adjustment, the values of variables `k`, `j`, and `dp` are updated for the next iteration to satisfy the loop condition.
Output State: **After the adjustment, the values of variables `k`, `j`, and `dp` are updated for the next iteration to satisfy the loop condition**
