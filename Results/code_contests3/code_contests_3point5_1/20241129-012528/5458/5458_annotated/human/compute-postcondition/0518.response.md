Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, `j` are integers. If i == 0 and the loop is executed, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be assigned the value 1. If i != 0 and the loop is executed, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] will be updated based on the calculations in the else part. If the loop does not execute due to the conditions not being met, the variables remain unchanged.**
