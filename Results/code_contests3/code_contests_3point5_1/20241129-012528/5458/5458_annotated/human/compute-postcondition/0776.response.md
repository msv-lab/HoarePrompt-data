According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `k`, `i`, and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1. Since `k` is being iterated from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2**
