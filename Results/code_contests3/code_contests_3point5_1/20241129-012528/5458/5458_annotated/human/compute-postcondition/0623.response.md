Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input provided through `raw_input().split()`. Since the specific input values are not known, the states of `n`, `m`, and `s` will be based on the input values received. Therefore, the Output State is: The final calculated value of `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.
Output State: **The final calculated value of `dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`**
