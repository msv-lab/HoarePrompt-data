Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are affected by the operation. Since `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time by incrementing `k` by 1. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0. The variable `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
