Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `s`, `n`, `j` are maintained based on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. The final value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be the accumulated result of the calculations performed in the loop, considering the conditions and assignments for each iteration.**
