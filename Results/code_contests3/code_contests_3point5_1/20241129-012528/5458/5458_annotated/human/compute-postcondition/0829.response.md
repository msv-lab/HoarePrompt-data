According to the code, the loop will execute `n^2` times. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `n` are maintained within the range of the input values. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values**
