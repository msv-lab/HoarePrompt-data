According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is updated to be greater than or equal to `s`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `dp[i][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1 if `i == 0` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation if `i != 0`, `s` is greater than 0 after the execution of the if else block**
