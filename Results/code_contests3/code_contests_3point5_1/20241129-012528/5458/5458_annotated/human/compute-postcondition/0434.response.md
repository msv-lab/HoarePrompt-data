Example Answer:
The code assigns the value 1 to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k + 1`, `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1, dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is 1**
