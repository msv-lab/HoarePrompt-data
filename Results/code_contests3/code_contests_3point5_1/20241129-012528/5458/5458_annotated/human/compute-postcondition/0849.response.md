Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are within the range of 1 to `m` inclusive, `m`, `s`, `n` are maintained within the range of the input values, `s` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` is within the range of 1 to `s + 1` inclusive. If `j` is greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables and the loop or if statement continues execution.***
