Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, and `k` are given, and the assignment is carried out accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers with `dp` being m + 2, `i+1`, `j` being greater than `k`, and `k` being 1.
Output State: **`dp`, `i+1`, `j`, `k` are integers with `dp` being m + 2, `i+1`, `j` being greater than `k`, and `k` being 1**
