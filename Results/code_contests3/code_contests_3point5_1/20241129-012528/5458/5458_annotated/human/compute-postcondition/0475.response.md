According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k, i` are 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0.**
