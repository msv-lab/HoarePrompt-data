Output State: **Output is the result of the modulo operation on the element located at index `n`, `m` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 2, `dp[i][j + 1][k]` is either assigned the value 1 or incremented based on the conditions provided. If j > k, the program executes the specified operations. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by the modulo operation result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % `mod`**
