Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `%` is the modulus operator. The previous values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are known, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: N, M, S, n, m, j, s, i are positive integers within their respective ranges. i is not equal to 0. If j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **N, M, S, n, m, j, s, i are positive integers within their respective ranges. i is not equal to 0. If j > k, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated accordingly.**
