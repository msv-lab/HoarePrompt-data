According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range of `1` to `s + 1`. 
Before the loop starts, `n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is incremented by 1 and less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`n`, `m`, `j` are 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1 and less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute one more time**
