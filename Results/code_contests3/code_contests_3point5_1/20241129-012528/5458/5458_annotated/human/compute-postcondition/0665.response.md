Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. The final values of `i`, `j`, `k` are dependent on the loop execution, and the final values of `dp` are dependent on calculations within the loop and conditions met during each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the final value of `j` must be incremented by 1. After entering the if condition where `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program state is determined by the specified conditions and calculations.**
