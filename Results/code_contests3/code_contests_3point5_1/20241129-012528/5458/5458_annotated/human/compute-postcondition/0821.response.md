Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within certain ranges, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated based on the given conditions, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` remain the same.
Output State: **`k` is within the range of 1 to `s+1`, `dp` is updated based on the given conditions, `i`, `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` remain the same**
