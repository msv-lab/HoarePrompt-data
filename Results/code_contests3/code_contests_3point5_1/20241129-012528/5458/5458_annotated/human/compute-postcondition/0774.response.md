Example Answer:
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo operation result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` to it. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial state remains the same, so the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` remain the same.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `n` remain the same**
