Output State: **All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, and `j+1` are integers greater than 0. The variable `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will continue with the updated values of the variables. The equation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is applied, where the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is taken modulo `mod` and assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
