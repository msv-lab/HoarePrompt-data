Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i == 0` and `j+1 >= k+2`, the loop will execute one more time. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers and the loop will execute one more time based on the condition.
Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+2`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers and the loop will execute one more time based on the condition**
