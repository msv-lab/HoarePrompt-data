Postcondition: ***After the adjustment, the values of variables `k`, `j`, and `dp` are updated for the next iteration to satisfy the loop condition. If `i == 0` and `j >= k`, the program will continue with the next iteration. Otherwise, the values of variables `k`, `j`, and `dp` are updated according to the formula provided for the next iteration to satisfy the loop condition.***
