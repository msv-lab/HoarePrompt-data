Postcondition: ***All variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, and `j+1` are integers greater than 0. The variable `j` is less than `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the loop will continue with the updated values of the variables.***
