Postcondition: ***`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 7, `s` is 20, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program continues with the given values. If `i` is not 0, `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
