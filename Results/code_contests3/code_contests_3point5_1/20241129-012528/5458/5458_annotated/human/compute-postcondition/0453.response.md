According to the code, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `s` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is at least 1. Additionally, since the loop needs to execute a second time, `m` should be greater than or equal to 1 and `j` should remain as 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k, i` are all 0, for the loop to execute a second time `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 1**
