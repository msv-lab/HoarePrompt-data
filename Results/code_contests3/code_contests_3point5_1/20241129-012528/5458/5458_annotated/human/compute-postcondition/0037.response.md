Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i` are modified based on the conditions specified in the code. For the loop to execute again, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, no change in variables and the loop continues execution. `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
