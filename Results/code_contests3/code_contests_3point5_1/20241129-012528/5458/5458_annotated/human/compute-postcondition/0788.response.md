Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are within the specified ranges. After execution, the affected variables are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j` remain within the range of 1 to `s`, `m`, `n`, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time.**
