Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Since `i` is 9, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1, the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is the same as the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 1, `s` is 20, `k` is 1, `i` is 9, and `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop for the loop to execute. i is not equal to 0. In addition, `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`n` is 10, `m` is 5, `j` is 1, `s` is 20, `k` is 1, `i` is 9, and `dp` is updated based on the calculations within the loop for the loop to execute. i is not equal to 0. In addition, `j` is greater than `k`**.
