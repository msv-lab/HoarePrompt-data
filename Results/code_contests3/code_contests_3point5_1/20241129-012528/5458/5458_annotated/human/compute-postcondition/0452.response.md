According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is 0. As the loop increments `j` by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 1 and `m` should be at least 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `j` is 1, `s`, `k, i` are all 0, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` should be greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is 1**
