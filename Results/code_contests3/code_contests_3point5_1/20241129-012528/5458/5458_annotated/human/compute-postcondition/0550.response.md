Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly given, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0 and the above operation is performed on the dp array.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j` are integers greater than 0 and the dp array is updated based on the given operation**
