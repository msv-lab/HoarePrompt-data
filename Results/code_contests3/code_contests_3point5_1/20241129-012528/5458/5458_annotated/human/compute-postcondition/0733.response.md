Example Answer:
The value 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The previous values of the variables are not directly provided, but based on the given initial state, `i` is 0 and the loop is executed for `j` in the range of 1 to `m`. When the condition `j >= k` is true, the state of the program variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute, and `i` remains 0.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute, `i` is 0**
