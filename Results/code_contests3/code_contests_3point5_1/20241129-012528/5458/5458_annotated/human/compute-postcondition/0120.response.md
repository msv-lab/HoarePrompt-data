Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j`, `k` are integers, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before. For the loop to execute again, `j` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, there is no change in the values of the variables, and the loop continues.
