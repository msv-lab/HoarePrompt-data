Postcondition: ***After the if else block, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2 and `m` unchanged. For the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then after the if else block, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2 and `m` unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1.***
