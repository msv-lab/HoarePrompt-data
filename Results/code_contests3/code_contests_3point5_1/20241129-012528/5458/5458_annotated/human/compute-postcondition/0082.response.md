Output State: **`i`, `j+1`, `k+1`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s+1` are integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `j+1` must be less than or equal to `m`. `i` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
