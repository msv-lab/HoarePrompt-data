Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the modulo of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with `mod`. The previous values of the variables `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. If `j` is greater than `k`, the values are updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, and `s` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is updated to be greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation, and `s` is greater than 0**
