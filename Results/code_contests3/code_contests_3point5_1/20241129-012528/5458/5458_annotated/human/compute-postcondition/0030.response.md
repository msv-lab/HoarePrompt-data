Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `i`, `k` are modified based on the conditions specified in the code. If `i == 0`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1 if `j >= k`. If `i != 0`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditional statement provided.***
