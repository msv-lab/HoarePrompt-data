According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. The loop will run from `j=1` to `j=m`. Since `i` is not mentioned in the loop, it does not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes again, the states need to be adjusted to `j` is now 1.
State: **`i`, `j` is 1, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are as before, for the loop to execute again `j` is 1**
