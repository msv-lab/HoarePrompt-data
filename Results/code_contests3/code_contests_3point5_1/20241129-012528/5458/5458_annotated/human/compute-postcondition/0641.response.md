Postcondition: ***`dp[n]` is dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s`. The loop executes the first time `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. After entering the if condition, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
