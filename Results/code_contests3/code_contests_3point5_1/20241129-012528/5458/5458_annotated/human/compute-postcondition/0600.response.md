According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` values are updated. For the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be less than `s`, and `k` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k+1`, `i+1`, `j+1` are integers greater than 0, `j` is less than `m`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k+1]` values are updated**
