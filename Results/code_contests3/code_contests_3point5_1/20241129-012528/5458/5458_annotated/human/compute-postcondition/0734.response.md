Postcondition: ***`dp`, `i`, `k`, `m`, `s` are dependent on the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` where `n`, `m`, and `s` are greater than 0, `j` is in the range of 1 to `m` for the loop to execute, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
