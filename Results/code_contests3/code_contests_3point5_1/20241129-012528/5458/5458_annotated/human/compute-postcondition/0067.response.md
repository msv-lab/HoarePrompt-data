Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values of `i` and `j` are used to access the elements in the 3-dimensional array `dp`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i`, `j` are integers, `k` is the next integer after the previous iteration to satisfy the condition `k < s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.
Output State: **`i`, `j` are integers, `k` is the next integer after the previous iteration to satisfy the condition `k < s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
