Example Answer:
The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `mod` is a constant value. The loop continues to execute as long as `j` is greater than `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` remain as 1 and greater than 0 respectively, and the loop continues if `j` is greater than `k`.
Output State: **`dp`, `i`, `j+1`, `k + 1`, `m`, `s` remain as 1 and greater than 0 respectively, and the loop continues if `j` is greater than `k`**
