According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the values of variables `i`, `j`, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` are already set and do not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `s` needs to be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **After all iterations of the loop, the values of variables `i`, `j` is 2, `k`, `N`, `M`, `S`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `dp` remain as before, with `j` being 2, `m` remains the same, for the loop to execute `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
