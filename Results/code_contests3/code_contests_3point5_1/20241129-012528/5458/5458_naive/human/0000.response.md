Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created given the constraints provided in the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to iterate through all possible combinations of integers in the Bingo card and ensures that the conditions of the Bingo card are met. The program then outputs the remainder of the maximum number of Bingo cards that can be created divided by 100000. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases.
