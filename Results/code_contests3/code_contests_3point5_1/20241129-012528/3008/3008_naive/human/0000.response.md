Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it uses input() to take the input, which returns a string type. Then it tries to perform arithmetic operations directly on the string without converting it to an integer. This will lead to a TypeError. Additionally, the logic of the program is flawed and will not produce the correct output for all cases as per the problem description.
