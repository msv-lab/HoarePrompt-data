Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description requires finding the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce a magic number to zero by subtracting a digit from it in each step. However, the program simply calculates a mathematical expression based on the input number without actually performing the required operations.

The program should be revised to actually implement the required functionality of subtracting a digit from the magic number in each step until it reaches zero.
