Example Answer:
If the last digit of `n` is not 0, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `n` and `s` remain the same. The expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is calculated based on the updated values of `n` and `s`.
Output State: **If the last digit of `n` is not 0, then `s` is incremented by 1. The expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is calculated based on the updated values of `n` and `s.**
