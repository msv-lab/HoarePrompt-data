The function `func` reads an input value `n`, checks if the remainder of dividing `n` by 10 is not 0, sets `s` to 1 in that case, and then prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. It does not return any value. The code may have potential issues because `input()` returns a string, so the division operation might not work as intended, potentially causing a TypeError.
