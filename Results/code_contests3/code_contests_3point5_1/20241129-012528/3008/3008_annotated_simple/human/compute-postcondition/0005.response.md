Example Answer:
The value of `s` depends on the remainder of dividing `n` by 10. If the remainder is not 0, `s` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0. Then, the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` is evaluated and printed. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `s` is 1 if the remainder of dividing `n` by 10 is not 0, otherwise `s` is 0.**
