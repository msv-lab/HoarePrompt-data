Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program is supposed to count the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero by subtracting a digit from it until it equals zero. However, the code provided does not implement this logic correctly.

For example, if we take the input `24`, the expected minimum number of operations should be 5, as shown in the problem description: 24 → 20 → 18 → 10 → 9 → 0. But the code does not perform the required subtractions to reach zero.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.
