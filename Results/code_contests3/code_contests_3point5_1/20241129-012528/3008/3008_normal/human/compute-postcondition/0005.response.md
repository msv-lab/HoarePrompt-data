Example Answer:
If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0, then `s` is set to 1. The value `n` is divided by 10 and multiplied by 2, then added to the value of `s`. Depending on the initial value of `n` and the condition, the final output may vary.
Output State: **Depends on the initial value of `n` and the condition, the final output may vary**
