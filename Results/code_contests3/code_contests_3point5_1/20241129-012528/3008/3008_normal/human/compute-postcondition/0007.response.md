Functionality: **The function prompts the user to input a value for `n`, calculates a value `s` based on whether the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0, and then prints the result of the expression 2 * (n / 10) + s. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.** 

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality: 
- The function does not handle cases where the user enters a non-integer value for `n`.
- If the input `n` is 0, there will be a division by zero error when calculating the expression, but this case is not handled in the function.
