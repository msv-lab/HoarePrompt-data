Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value 1. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer that the user inputs, and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer that the user inputs, `s` is 1, the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that the user inputs, `s` is 1, the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is not 0**
