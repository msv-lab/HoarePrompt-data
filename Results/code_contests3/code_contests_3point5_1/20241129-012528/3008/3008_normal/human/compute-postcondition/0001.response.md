Example Answer: 
`s` is initialized to 0. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer input by the user, but since `s` is not affected by `n`, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer that the user inputs, `s` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that the user inputs, `s` is 0**
