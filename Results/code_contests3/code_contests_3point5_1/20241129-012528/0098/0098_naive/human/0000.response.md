Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle the case when n is equal to 3 properly. When n is equal to 3, the formula used in the program to calculate the minimum length of a side of the square 2n-gon can be embedded in does not give the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it fails for the case when n = 3.
