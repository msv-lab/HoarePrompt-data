The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. The function returns the result of applying the cosine of (pi / (4 * n)) divided by the sine of (pi / (2 * n)). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 and return the result of the specified mathematical operation involving cosine and sine.
