Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an odd integer `n` between 3 and 199 as input. It then calculates and returns the result of applying the cosine of (pi / (4 * n)) divided by the sine of (pi / (2 * n)), which is the minimum length of a side of the square that a 2n-gon can be embedded in.

Since the program accurately calculates the minimum length of the side of the square as required by the problem description for any given odd integer `n`, the program is correct.
