#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the result of the mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine of specific angles based on the odd integer n provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199 and calculates the result of a mathematical expression involving cosine and sine of specific angles based on the value of `n`. The function returns this calculated result.
