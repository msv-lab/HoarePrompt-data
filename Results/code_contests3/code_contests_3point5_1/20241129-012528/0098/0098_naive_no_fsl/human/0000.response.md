Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum length of a side of the square in which a 2n-gon can be embedded. The formula used in the `func_1` function is mathematically correct for the given problem description. The program iterates through the test cases and prints the output with the required precision. The code seems to work correctly for all possible odd values of n within the given constraints.
