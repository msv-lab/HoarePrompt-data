#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.**
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the result of the mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions with the given odd integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts an odd integer n within the range of 3 to 199 and returns the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions with the given integer n. The function calculates the cosine of π / (4 * n) divided by the sine of π / (2 * n) and returns the result.
