Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the function `func_1` which takes an odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199 and calculates the result of a mathematical expression involving the cosine and sine functions with the given integer `n`. 
- The function calculates the cosine of π / (4 * n) divided by the sine of π / (2 * n) and returns the result. 
- The code iterates through the test cases, calculates the minimum length of a side of the square that the 2n-gon can be embedded in, and prints the result with 9 decimal places accuracy. 
- Since the code follows the problem description and the output hints provided, we can determine that the code is correct for all potential cases.
