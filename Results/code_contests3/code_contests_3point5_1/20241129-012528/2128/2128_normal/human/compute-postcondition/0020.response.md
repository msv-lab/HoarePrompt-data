Example Answer:
`arr` is sorted in descending order. The previous values of variables are `t` greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` with assigned values, `arr` as a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans` as the sum of the first element of `arr` and elements at indices 1 to `k` inclusive. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after applying the sorting operation.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
