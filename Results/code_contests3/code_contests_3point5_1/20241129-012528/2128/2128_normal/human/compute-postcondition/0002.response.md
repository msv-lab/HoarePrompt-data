Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than or equal to 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))` where `sys.stdin.readline()` reads a line from input and `split(' ')` splits the input line into a list of strings which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`.**
