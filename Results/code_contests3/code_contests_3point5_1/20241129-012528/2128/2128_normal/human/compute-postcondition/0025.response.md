Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` would be the second largest element in the list. Therefore, `ans` is increased by the second largest element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list plus the second largest element, `l` is 1**
