Example Answer:
The value at index `l` of the `arr` list is added to `ans`. Since `l` is initially 3, it must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute one more time. The new value of `ans` will be the sum of the current `ans` value and the element at index 3 of the `arr` list. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the largest and second largest elements in the list plus the element at index 3 of the list, `l` is 3**
