According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 0. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and elements at indices 1 to `k` inclusive, if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`, `k` is assigned the value of the length of `arr` - 1, for the loop to execute one more time `i` should be incremented by 1**
