Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is the largest element since the list is sorted in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the largest element in the list.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list**
