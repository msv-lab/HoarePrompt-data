According to the code, the loop will execute t times, where t is the number of test cases. Before the loop starts, t is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Therefore, the state should be adjusted such that t is greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute.
State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than or equal to 0**
