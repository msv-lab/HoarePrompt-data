Example Answer:
`arr` is assigned a list of integers converted from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`. The size of the list `arr` depends on the input values. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases, for the loop to execute `t` is greater than or equal to 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split(' '))`; `arr` is a list of integers.
