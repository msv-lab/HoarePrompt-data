Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` will output the value stored in the variable `ans`, which is updated to include the sum of values in the list `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`. Since `ans` already includes this sum, the output will be the sum of values in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.
Output State: **The sum of values in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]**.
