Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is incremented by 1, the next value of `l` will be considered for the addition. The loop will continue until `l` is less than or equal to `k + 1`, where `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. As `arr` is sorted in descending order, the largest values will be added first. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include the sum of values in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `l` needs to be less than or equal to `k + 1`.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include the sum of values in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `l` needs to be less than or equal to `k + 1`**
