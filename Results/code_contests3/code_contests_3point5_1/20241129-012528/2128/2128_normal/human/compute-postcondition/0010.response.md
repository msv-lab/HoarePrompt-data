Example Answer:
`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` ranges from 1 to `k` inclusive. The initial value of `ans` is the first element of `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and elements at indices 1 to `k` inclusive.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and elements at indices 1 to `k` inclusive**
