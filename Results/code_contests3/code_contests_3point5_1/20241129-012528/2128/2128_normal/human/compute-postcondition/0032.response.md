According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1, so `i` becomes i+1. 
State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the largest `k` elements in the list, `l` is `k`, the sum of the largest `k` elements in the list is printed, for the loop to execute again `i` is i+1**
