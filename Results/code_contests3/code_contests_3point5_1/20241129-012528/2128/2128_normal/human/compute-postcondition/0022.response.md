Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is a previously assigned value. Since the initial state mentions that `n` and `k` have assigned values, the new value of `k` will be one less than the previous value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list.
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element in the list**
