Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is incremented by 1. The loop will execute one more time if `l` is less than or equal to `k + 1`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `k` have assigned values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include the sum of values in `arr` from `arr[0]` to `arr[l]`, `l` is incremented by 1, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1` for the loop to execute one more time `l` needs to be less than or equal to `k + 1**
