Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. Since `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `k` will be one less than the original value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is still a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is still a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`**
