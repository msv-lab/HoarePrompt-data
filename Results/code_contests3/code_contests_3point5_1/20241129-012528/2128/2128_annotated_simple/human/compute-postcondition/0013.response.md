According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l] + arr[l+1]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` should be less than `k+1`.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l] + arr[l+1]`, for the loop to execute another time `l` should be less than `k+1`**
