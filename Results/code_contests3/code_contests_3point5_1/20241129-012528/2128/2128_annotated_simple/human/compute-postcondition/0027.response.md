Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is less than or equal to `k + 1`. The loop executes one more time since `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is greater than 0, `l` is less than or equal to `k + 1
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` is greater than 0, `l` is less than or equal to `k + 1**
