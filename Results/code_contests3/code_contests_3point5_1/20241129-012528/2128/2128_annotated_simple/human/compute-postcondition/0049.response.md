Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, then for each iteration in the range of `t`, it reads integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`, sorts the list in descending order, calculates a sum `ans` based on the elements in `arr` up to index `k`, and prints the final `ans` value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
