According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of list `arr`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` should be increased by the value at index `l+1` of list `arr`.
State: **variable `ans` is increased by the value at index `l+1` of list `arr`, for the loop to execute a second time `l` is incremented by 1 and should be less than or equal to `k`**
