Example Answer:
The list `arr` is sorted in descending order using the `sorted()` function. As the list `arr` was created by mapping input values to integers, sorting it in reverse order will rearrange the elements in descending order. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
