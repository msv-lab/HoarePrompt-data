According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `l` needs to be incremented by 1
- If `k` was the limiting factor in the previous iteration, `k` should be increased to allow for another iteration.
- If `arr` is used in any way to determine the continuation of the loop, ensure that the necessary changes are made to `arr` to facilitate the next iteration.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l+1]`.**
