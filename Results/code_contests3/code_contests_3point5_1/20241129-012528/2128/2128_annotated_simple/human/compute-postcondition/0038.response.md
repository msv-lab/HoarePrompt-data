Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after applying the sorted function with reverse=True, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr`, `i` is incremented by the total number of elements in the updated list `arr`, `ans` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k + 1`, the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr` is printed, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is assigned the value from the input split by space, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order after applying the sorted function with reverse=True, `ans` is increased by the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr`, `i` is incremented by the total number of elements in the updated list `arr`, `ans` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k + 1`, the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr` is printed, `ans` is assigned the value of the sum of all elements in the updated list `arr`.***
