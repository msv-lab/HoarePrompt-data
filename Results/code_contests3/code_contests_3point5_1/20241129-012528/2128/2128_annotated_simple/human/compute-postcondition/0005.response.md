Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `arr`, which is already sorted in descending order. Therefore, `ans` will be the largest integer in the list `arr`. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in the list `arr`**
