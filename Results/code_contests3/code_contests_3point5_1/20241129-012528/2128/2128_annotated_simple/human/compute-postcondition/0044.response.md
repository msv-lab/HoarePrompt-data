Example Answer:
Initially, `ans` is increased by the value at index `l+1` of list `arr`. The loop will execute a second time if `l` is incremented by 1 and is less than or equal to `k`. After the code execution, `ans` will have the sum of values at index `l+1` and `l+2` of list `arr`. The value of `l` is also incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop. 
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the sum of values at index `l+1` and `l+2` of list `arr`, `l` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.**
