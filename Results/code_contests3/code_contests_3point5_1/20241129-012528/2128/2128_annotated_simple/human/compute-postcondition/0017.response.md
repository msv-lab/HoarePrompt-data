According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
