Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value stored in the variable `ans`. The values of `ans` and `l` are not changed by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated with the sum of values at index `k` of list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k + 1`.
Output State: **`ans` is updated with the sum of values at index `k` of list `arr`, `l` is equal to `k + 1**
