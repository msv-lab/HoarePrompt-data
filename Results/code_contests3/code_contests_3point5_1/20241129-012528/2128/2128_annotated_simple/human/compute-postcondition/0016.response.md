Example Answer:
The program prints the value of `ans`, which is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`. The initial state includes `t` as a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` with new values, `arr` as a list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans` increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`**
