According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, variable `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of list `arr`, `l` is less than or equal to `k`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **variable `ans` is increased by the value at index `l+1` of list `arr`**
