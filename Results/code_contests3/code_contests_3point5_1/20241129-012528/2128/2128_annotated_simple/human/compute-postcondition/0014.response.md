Example Answer:
`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. The loop will execute again if `l` is less than `k+1`. The previous values of `ans` and `arr` are known, so after execution, the new value of `ans` will be `ans + arr[l]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, and the loop will execute again if `l` is less than `k+1`.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, the loop will execute again if `l` is less than `k+1`**
