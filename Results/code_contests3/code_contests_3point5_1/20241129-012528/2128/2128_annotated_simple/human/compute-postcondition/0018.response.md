Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `k` are assigned by mapping the input values from standard input after splitting them. The variables `n` and `k` will be updated with new values from the input. The other variables `arr`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` have new values, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
