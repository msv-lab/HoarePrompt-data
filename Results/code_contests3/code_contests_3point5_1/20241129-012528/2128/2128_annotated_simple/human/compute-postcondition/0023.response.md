Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a new value, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order from the input, `ans` is increased by the sum of the first `k` elements in the list `arr`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in `arr`.***
