Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by the value at index `l` of the `arr` list. The values of `ans`, `arr`, and `l` are not provided, so the output state is: variable `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of list `arr`.
Output State: **variable `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of list `arr`**
