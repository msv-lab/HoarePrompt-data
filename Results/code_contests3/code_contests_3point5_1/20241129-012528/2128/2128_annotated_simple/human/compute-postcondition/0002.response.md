Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space. `sys.stdin.readline().split(' ')` reads a line from the standard input, splits it by space, and maps the values to `n` and `k`. The initial state variable `t` is not affected.
Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input after splitting the input string by space**
