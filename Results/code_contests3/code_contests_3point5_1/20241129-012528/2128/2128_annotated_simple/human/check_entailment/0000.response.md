Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input, sorts the barrels in descending order, calculates the maximum possible difference between the maximum and minimum amount of water in the barrels after k pourings, and prints the result for each test case. The program ensures that the number of pourings does not exceed the number of barrels and calculates the difference accurately. It handles multiple test cases as described in the problem statement.
