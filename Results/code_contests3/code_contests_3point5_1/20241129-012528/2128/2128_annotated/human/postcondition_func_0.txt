Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. The function then sorts `arr` in reverse order, calculates the sum of the largest value in `arr` and the elements from index 1 to `k`, and prints this sum. The function handles multiple test cases as specified. However, the function lacks error handling for cases where the input parameters do not adhere to the specified constraints, such as `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.
