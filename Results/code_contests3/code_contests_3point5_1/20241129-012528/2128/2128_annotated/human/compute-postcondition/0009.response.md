According to the code, the loop can execute if k is greater than or equal to 1. The loop will iterate from 1 to k inclusive. Since k is given as 4, the loop will definitely execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the initial state for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` is 5, `k` is 4, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list**
