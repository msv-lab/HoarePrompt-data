Example Answer:
t is assigned the value of int(sys.stdin.readline()), where sys.stdin.readline() reads input from the standard input. The value of t is an integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: t is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000**
