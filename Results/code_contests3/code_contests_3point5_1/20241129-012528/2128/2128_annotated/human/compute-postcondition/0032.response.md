According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is between 1 and 1000. Since the loop is iterating from 0 to t, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` would be t. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be t + 1.
State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first five largest values in the list, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is t + 1**
