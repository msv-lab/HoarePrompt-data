Example Answer: 
The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order. Since the list is already updated with integers from standard input, sorting it in reverse order will arrange the elements from largest to smallest. After sorting, the fifth, fourth, third, second, and first largest values will be at indices 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 respectively. The variable `ans` is then updated by adding these values. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are updated by mapping integers from standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is updated by adding the fifth, fourth, third, second, and first largest values of the list.
Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are updated by mapping integers from standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is updated by adding the fifth, fourth, third, second, and first largest values of the list**
