Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` of the `arr` list. Since `l` should be 2 for the loop to execute one more time, the value at index 2 of the list is added to `ans`. The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order, so the value at index 2 is known to be the third largest value. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding the third largest value of the list. Other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` is 5, `k` is 4, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is updated by adding the third largest value of the list**
