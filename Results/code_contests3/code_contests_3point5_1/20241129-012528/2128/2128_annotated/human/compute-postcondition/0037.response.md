Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is an input integer, so `k` will be one less than the input integer. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the first largest value in the list, `i` is t + 1.
Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the first largest value in the list, `i` is t + 1**
