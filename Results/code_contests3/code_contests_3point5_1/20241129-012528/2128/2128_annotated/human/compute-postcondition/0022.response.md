Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`, where `n` is mapped from standard input. The value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are updated by mapping integers from standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is updated by adding the fifth, fourth, third, second, and first largest values of the list, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the sorted `arr` list, `k` is n - 1.
Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are updated by mapping integers from standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is updated by adding the fifth, fourth, third, second, and first largest values of the list, `ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the sorted `arr` list, `k` is n - 1**
