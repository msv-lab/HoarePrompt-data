Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the `arr` list, which is the maximum value since the list is sorted in reverse order. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the maximum value in the list**
