The value of `ans` is increased by the value at index `l` of the `arr` list. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order and `ans` is the maximum value in the list, after execution, `ans` will be the sum of the current `ans` and the value at index `l` of the `arr` list. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` is 5, `k` is 4, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the previous `ans` and the value at index `l` of the list**
