Example Answer:
`ans` is updated by adding the value at index `l` of the `arr` list. Since `l` is 5, the third largest value of the list is added to `ans`. The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order, so the third largest value is the one at index 2. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[5]`, which is the third largest value of the list. The other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` is 5, `k` is 4, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is updated by adding the third largest value of the list, `l` is 5**
