The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, the function will accept integers n, k, and a list of integers a_i. The constraints for these parameters are specified as follows: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a_i is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function will process each test case and return the required output based on the input parameters. Since there are no specific details provided on the exact operation or output format, the functionality of the function `func` can be summarized as follows: the function processes multiple test cases with specified constraints and returns the desired output for each test case.
