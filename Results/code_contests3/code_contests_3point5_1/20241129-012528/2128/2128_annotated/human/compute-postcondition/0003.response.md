Example Answer:
`arr` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input values from standard input after splitting them. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input**
