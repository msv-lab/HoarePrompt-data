Example Answer:
`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are known, so if `n = 5`, then `k` will be `4`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` is 5; `k` is 4; `arr` list is sorted in reverse order; `ans` is the maximum value in the list.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` is 5; `k` is 4; `arr` list is sorted in reverse order; `ans` is the maximum value in the list.**
