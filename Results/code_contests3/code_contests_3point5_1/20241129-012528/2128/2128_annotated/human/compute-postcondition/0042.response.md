Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is incremented by adding the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is in the range 1 to k+1. The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order, so the largest value is at the beginning. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first largest value in the list and arr[l], `i` is t + 1, `l` is in the range 1 to k+1.
Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 1000, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is the sum of the first largest value in the list and arr[l], `i` is t + 1, `l` is in the range 1 to k+1**
