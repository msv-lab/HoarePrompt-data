Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned the values obtained by mapping the integers from the input separated by a space. The values are taken from the standard input. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input**
