Example Answer:
The `arr` list is sorted in reverse order. The previous values of the `arr` list are unknown, but after sorting in reverse order, the order of elements in the `arr` list is changed accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `n` and `k` are mapped integers from the standard input, `arr` list is sorted in reverse order**
