Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes the input values n and m, then generates the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p). The program calculates the factorial of the remaining length of the permutation and uses it to determine the index of the next element in the permutation. It then removes that element from the list of possible elements and continues the process until all elements are selected.

The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the correct output for all possible input cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
