Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integer inputs `n` and `m` and calculates the number of permutations of length `n`.
- It then iterates through these permutations to find the maximum possible value of `f(p)` based on the given constraints.
- The code prints out the calculated values as it iterates through the permutations.
- The implementation appears to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
- The output hints also agree with the code, providing a summary of the functionality implemented.
- Since the code seems to handle all cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints, we can conclude that the correctness of the code is True.
