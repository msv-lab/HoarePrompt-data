Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing the value of `i` by the factorial of `n - k`. The value of `i` is obtained from `b` decreased by 1, and the value of `n - k` is represented by `f`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decreased by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` inclusive, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and `d` is the result of `i // f`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decreased by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` inclusive, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and `d` is the result of `i // f`**
