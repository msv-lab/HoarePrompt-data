Example Answer:
The value at index `d` of the modified range `p` is removed by calling the `remove` method. After the removal, the index of the elements in the list `p` might have shifted. Therefore, the Output State is: The value at index `d` of the modified range `p` is removed.
Output State: **The value at index `d` of the modified range `p` is removed**
