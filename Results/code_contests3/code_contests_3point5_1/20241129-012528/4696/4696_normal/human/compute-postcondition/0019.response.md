Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decreased by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` inclusive excluding the element at index `d`, `d` is the result of `i // f`, and the value at index `d` of range `p` is removed, `i` is modified to be the remainder of `i` divided by `f`, `k` must be less than or equal to `n + 1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `d` is the result of `i // f`**
