Example Answer:
`i` is assigned the integer value of `b`, which was obtained after splitting the input string. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string; `i` is an integer value obtained from `b`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string; `i` is an integer value obtained from `b`**
