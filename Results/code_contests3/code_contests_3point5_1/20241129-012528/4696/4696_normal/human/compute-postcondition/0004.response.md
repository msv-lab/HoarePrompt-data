Example Answer:
`p` is assigned a range from 1 to `n` inclusive. The value of `n` is already defined, so `p` will be a range from 1 to the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string; `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` is decreased by 1; `p` is a range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string; `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` is decreased by 1; `p` is a range from 1 to `n` inclusive**
