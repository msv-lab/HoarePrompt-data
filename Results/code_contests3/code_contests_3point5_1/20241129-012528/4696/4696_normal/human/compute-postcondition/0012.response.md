Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string, `i` is an integer value obtained from `b` decreased by 1, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` inclusive excluding the element at index `d`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and `d` is the result of `i // f, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`**
