Functionality: **The function takes two integer inputs `n` and `m`, calculates the number of permutations of length `n`, and then iterates through these permutations to find the maximum possible value of `f(p)` based on the given constraints. It prints out the calculated values as it iterates through the permutations. There is a missing `factorial` function in the code that calculates the factorial of a number. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
