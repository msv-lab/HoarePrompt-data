Example Answer:
The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned values after splitting the input string**
