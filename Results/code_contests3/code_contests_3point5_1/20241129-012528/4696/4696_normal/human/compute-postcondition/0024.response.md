The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the number of permutations of length n and finds the maximum possible value of f(p), where n and m are integers satisfying 1 <= m <= cntn. The function then returns this maximum possible value of f(p). Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the number of permutations of length n and find the maximum possible value of f(p) with the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the number of permutations of length n and returns the maximum possible value of f(p) with the given constraints.**
