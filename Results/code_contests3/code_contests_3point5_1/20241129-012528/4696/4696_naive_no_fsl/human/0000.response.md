Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and m as input, where n represents the length of the permutation and m is the lexicographically m-th permutation to find. It then calculates the permutation based on the given m value and outputs the result. The logic used in the program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for all possible cases. The program iterates through all the elements in the permutation and calculates the factorial value to determine the order of the elements in the output permutation. It then removes the selected element from the list and continues until all elements are processed. Since the logic is correct and follows the problem description for all possible inputs, the program is correct.
