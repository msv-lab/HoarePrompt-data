Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the input values of n and m, generates the permutation p, calculates the factorial, and then iterates through the permutation to print the lexicographically m-th permutation with the maximum possible value of f(p). The program ensures that all permutations are printed in the correct order.
