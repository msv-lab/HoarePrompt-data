The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p), denoted as cntn. The function then returns the result without any additional processing. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p) and return the result.
