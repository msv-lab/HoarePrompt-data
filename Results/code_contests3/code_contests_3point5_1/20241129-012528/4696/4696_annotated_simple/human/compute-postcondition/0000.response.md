Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split by space.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p); `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split by space**
