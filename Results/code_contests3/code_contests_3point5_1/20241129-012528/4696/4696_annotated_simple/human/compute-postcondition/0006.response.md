Example Answer:
The value of `f` is assigned the result of calculating the factorial of `n - k`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split by space, `i` is assigned the integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n (inclusive) for the loop to execute, `k` ranges from 1 to n, and `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split by space, `i` is assigned the integer value of `b - 1`, `p` is a range from 1 to n (inclusive) for the loop to execute, `k` ranges from 1 to n, and `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
