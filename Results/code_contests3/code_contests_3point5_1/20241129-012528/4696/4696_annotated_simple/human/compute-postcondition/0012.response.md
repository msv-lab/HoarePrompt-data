Example Answer:
The factorial of `n - k` is calculated and assigned to `f`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to n+1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and the value at index `d` of list `p` has been removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to n+1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and the value at index `d` of list `p` has been removed, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
