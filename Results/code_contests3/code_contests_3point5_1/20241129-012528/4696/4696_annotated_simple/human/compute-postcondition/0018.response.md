Example Answer:
The factorial of `n - k` is calculated and stored in variable `f`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to `n+1` excluding the current value of `k`, and `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to `n+1` excluding the current value of `k`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to `n+1` excluding the current value of `k`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, `i` is the remainder of `i` divided by `f`**
