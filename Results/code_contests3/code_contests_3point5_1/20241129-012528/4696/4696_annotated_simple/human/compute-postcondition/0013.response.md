The value of `d` is calculated as the floor division of `i` by `f`. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `p`, `k`, and `f` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to n excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to n+1, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`, and the value at index `d` of list `p` has been removed, `d` is calculated as i // f**
