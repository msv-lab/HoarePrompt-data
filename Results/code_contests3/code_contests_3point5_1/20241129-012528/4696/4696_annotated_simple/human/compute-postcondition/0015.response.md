Example Answer:
The element at index `d` is removed from the list `p`. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `k`, and `f` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to `n+1`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is defined, `a` and `b` are assigned values, `i` is the remainder of `b - 1` divided by `n - k`, `p` is a range from 1 to `n` excluding the element at index `d`, `k` ranges from 1 to `n+1`, `f` is the factorial of `n - k`**
