The function `func` reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `a` represents the length of permutations and `b` is a value used in calculations. It then calculates the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of f(p), removes elements from the list `p` based on calculations, and prints the result. The code does not explicitly return any value.
