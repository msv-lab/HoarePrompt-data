Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes input values for `n` and `m`, calculates the maximum possible value of f(p), and then iterates through a loop to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p). The program ensures that the output is in the correct format and follows the constraints given in the problem description.
