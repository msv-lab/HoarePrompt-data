The function takes user input for integers `a` and `b`, where `a` represents the length of permutations and `b` is modified by subtracting 1. It then calculates the maximum possible value of f(p) for permutations of length `n` based on certain constraints. The function iterates through a loop to compute values and remove processed elements from a list `p`.
