Example Answer:
The value of `i` is updated to the remainder of `i` divided by `f`. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the input values after splitting, `i` is an updated integer based on the input value of b - 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive with one less element, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of the floor division of `i` by `f`, and the value of `p[d]` has been removed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the input values after splitting, `i` is an updated integer based on the input value of b - 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive with one less element, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of the floor division of `i` by `f`, and the value of `p[d]` has been removed.**
