Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the input values after splitting, `i` is an updated integer based on the input value of b - 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive with one less element, `k` is n + 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), `d` is the result of the floor division of `i` by `f`, the value of `p[d]` has been removed for the next iteration, `f` is the factorial of (n - k), `d` is the result of the floor division of `i` by `f`. The value of `p[d]` is printed.**
