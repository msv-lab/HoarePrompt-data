Example Answer: 
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `split()` splits the input based on spaces. Since the initial state does not mention the values of `a` and `b`, the output state is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned the input values after splitting.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= m <= cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p); a and b are assigned the input values after splitting.**
