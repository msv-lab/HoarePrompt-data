Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the input values after splitting, `i` is an updated integer based on the input value of b - 1, `p` is an empty list, `k` is equal to n + 1, `f` is the factorial of 0, `d` is the result of the floor division of `i` by `f` (which is 0), and all values have been processed and removed from `p`.**
