Example Answer:
The value of `f` is assigned the factorial of `(n - k)`. Since `k` is initialized as 1, `n` is an integer from 1 to `cntn`, and `factorial` calculates the factorial of a number, the value of `f` will be the factorial of `(n - 1)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the input values after splitting, `i` is an integer based on the input value of b - 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1).
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, `a` and `b` are the input values after splitting, `i` is an integer based on the input value of b - 1, `p` is a range from 1 to n inclusive, `k` is 1, `f` is the factorial of (n - 1)**
