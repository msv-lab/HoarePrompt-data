Example Answer: 
`i` is assigned the value of `b`, where `b` is converted to an integer. The value of `b` is dependent on the input values after splitting, so the value of `i` will be accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the input values after splitting, i is an integer based on the input value of b.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the input values after splitting, i is an integer based on the input value of b**
