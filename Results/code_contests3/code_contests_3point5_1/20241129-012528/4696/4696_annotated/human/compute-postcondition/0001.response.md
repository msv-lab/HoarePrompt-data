Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the integer value of `a` after conversion. The values of `m`, `cntn`, `a`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the input values after splitting.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= m <= cntn, a and b are the input values after splitting**
