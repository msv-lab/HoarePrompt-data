Example Answer:
The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown based on the input value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, a and b are the input values after splitting, i is an integer based on the input value of b - 1.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= cntn, a and b are the input values after splitting, i is an integer based on the input value of b - 1**
