Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input about the number of companies, the number of employees in each company, and their salaries. It then calculates the minimal total increase of all salaries that allows merging all companies into one, as described in the problem description. The program iterates through each company, finds the maximum salary in each company, calculates the difference between the maximum salary in each company and the overall maximum salary, and then multiplies this difference by the number of employees in the company. Finally, it prints the total minimal increase required.

The program follows the instructions provided in the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
