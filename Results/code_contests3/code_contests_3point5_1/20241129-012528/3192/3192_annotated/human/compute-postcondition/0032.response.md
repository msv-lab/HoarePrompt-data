Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is equal to `arr1[0], `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by splitting raw input.
