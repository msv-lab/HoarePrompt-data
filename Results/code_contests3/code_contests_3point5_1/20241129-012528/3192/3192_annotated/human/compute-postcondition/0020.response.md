According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1` has at least one element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the value of `j` is the length of `arr1`, which doesn't ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `arr1` has at least one element, `j` is updated to 1, and `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
