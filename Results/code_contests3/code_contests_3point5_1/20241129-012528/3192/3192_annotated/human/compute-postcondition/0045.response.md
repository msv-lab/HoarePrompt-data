According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, ensure that the states are adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in all `arr1` lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in all `arr1` lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in each `arr1` list, `j` is equal to the first element in each `arr1` list, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
