Example Answer:
An empty list `arr` is initialized. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, and no other variables are impacted, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `arr` is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate, `arr` is an empty list**
