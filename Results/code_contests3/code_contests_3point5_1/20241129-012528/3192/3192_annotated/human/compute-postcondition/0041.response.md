Example Answer:
`arr2` appends the first element of `arr1`, and `arr1` is a list. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the first element in `arr1`, `arr` appends the value of `temp`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the first element in `arr1`, `arr` appends the value of `temp`**
