Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the second element in `arr1`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1` is a list of integers obtained by splitting raw input with at least 2 elements and the value at index 0 is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`.**
