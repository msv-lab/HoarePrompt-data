Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The values of other variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is empty, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces, `temp` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is empty, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces, `temp` is 0**
