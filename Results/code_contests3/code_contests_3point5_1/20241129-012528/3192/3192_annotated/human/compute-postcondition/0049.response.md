According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in all `arr1` lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in all `arr1` lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in each `arr1` list, `j` is equal to the first element in each `arr1` list, `ans` is updated by adding the product of (maxval - arr[i]) and arr2[i]. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in all `arr1` lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in all `arr1` lists, `arr2` contains the first element of each `arr1` list, `i` is equal to `n+1`, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in each `arr1` list, `j` is equal to the first element in each `arr1` list, `ans` is updated by adding the product of (maxval - arr[i]) and arr2[i]**
