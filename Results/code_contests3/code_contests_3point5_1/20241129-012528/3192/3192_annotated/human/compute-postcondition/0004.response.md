According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be greater than 0, `i` needs to be 0, `arr` remains empty, `maxval` is still 0, and `arr2` remains empty.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is empty, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
