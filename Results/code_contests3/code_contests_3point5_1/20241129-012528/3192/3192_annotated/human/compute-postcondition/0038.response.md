Example Answer:
`temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is equal to the second element in `arr1` plus 1. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than the first element in `arr1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the second element in `arr1` plus 1, `j` must be less than the first element in `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the second element in `arr1` plus 1, `j` must be less than the first element in `arr1`**
