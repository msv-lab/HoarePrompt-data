According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is 2, and `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and be less than `arr1[0]`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is 3, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
