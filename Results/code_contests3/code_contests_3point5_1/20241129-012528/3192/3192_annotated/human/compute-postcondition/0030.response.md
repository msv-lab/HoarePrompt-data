According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` remains unchanged.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]**
