According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the elements in `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element in `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the second element in `arr1` plus 1, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than the first element in `arr1` again.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1` and the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `i` is 1 less than the value at index 0 of `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is equal to the second element in `arr1` plus 1, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than the first element in `arr1`**
