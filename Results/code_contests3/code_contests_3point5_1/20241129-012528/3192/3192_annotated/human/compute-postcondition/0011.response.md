According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and the first element of `arr1` is the condition for the loop to execute again. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and be less than the first element of `arr1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is empty, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between `temp` and the value at index `j` in `arr1`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the first element of `arr1`**
