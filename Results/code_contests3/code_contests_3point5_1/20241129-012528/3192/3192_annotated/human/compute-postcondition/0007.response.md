According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. So, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` needs to be 1. Additionally, since `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function to input split by spaces, it must have at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, `arr1` should have at least one element. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is empty, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
