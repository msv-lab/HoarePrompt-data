According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, since `i` is used to access elements in `arr1`, the length of `arr1` should be greater than the new value of `i` (i.e., `j` should be greater than the new `i`). 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers created by mapping `int` function to input split by spaces with at least one element, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is the length of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` at index `i` and the previous maximum value stored in `maxval`.**
