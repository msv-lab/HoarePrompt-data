According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]` after the adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `j` is 2, `j` is less than `arr1[0]`**
