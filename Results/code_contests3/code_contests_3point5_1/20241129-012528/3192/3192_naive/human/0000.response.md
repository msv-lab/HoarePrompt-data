Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, calculates the maximum salary of each company, determines the overall maximum salary, and then calculates the total increase needed to make the maximum salary of each company equal to the overall maximum salary. This approach satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description. The program iterates through each company and calculates the increase needed, ensuring that the total increase is minimized. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and produces the correct output, the correctness is True.
