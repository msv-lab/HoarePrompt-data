According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the key states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes are:
- `i` should be set to 0 instead of `n-1` to start the loop from the beginning.
- `j` should be the length of the first input list `arr1` instead of the last one.
- `ans` should be 0 to start fresh calculations within the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the maximum values of each input list `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in all input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the lengths of each input list `arr1`, `i` is 0, `j` is the length of the first `arr1`, `ans` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
