According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `arr1[0]` and `j`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1. In the for loop, `j` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `arr1[0]` after the increase. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` is greater than 2**
