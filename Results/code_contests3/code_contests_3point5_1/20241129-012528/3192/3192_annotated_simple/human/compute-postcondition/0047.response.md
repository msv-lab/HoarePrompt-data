According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the length of the first `arr1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the maximum values of each input list `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in all input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the lengths of each input list `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the length of the first `arr1`, `ans` is incremented according to the formula**
