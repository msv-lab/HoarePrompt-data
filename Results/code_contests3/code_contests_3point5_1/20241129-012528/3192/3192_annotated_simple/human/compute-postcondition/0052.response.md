Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is computed as the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each `i` in the range of `len(arr)`. The variables `n`, `arr`, `temp`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `i`, `j` are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the maximum values of each input list `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in all input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the lengths of each input list `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is printed.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the maximum values of each input list `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in all input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the lengths of each input list `arr1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is the length of the last `arr1`, `ans` is printed**
