Example Answer:
The variable `maxval` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate. Each company description consists of an integer m_i representing the number of employees in the company, followed by m_i integers representing the salaries of the employees. Salaries are positive and do not exceed 10^9. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2*10^5. `arr` is an empty list. `maxval` is 0.
