According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `temp` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr1`, which means `j` is currently equal to the length of `arr1`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `j` should be updated to be less than `arr1[0]`. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be updated to 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1`, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
