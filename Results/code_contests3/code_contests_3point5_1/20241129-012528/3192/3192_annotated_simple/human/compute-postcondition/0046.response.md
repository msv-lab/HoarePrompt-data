The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` for index `i`. The value of `i` starts at 0 and iterates through the length of `arr1`. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not altered. After executing the code, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the maximum values of each input list `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in all input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the lengths of each input list `arr1`, `i` is the length of the first `arr1`, `j` is the length of the first `arr1`, `ans` is incremented according to the formula**
