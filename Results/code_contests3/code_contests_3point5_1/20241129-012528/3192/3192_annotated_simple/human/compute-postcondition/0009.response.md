According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than the first element of `arr1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in `arr1`, `arr1` has at least 1 element, `j` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the second time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in `arr1`, `arr1` has at least 1 element, `j` is 2**
