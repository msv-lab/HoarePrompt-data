According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `n` must still be a positive integer.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr1`**
