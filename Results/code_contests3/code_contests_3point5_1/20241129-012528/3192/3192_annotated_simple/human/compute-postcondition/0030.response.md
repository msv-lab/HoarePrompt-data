According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr1`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 and `i` should be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 2, `j` is the length of `arr1`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n`**
