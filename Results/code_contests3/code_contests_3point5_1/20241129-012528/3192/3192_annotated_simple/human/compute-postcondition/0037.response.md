According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `j` and `arr1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `arr1` is a list containing integers input by the user, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1` must be a list containing integers input by the user, `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 1, `temp` must be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, and `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is now updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1` is a list containing integers input by the user, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`**
