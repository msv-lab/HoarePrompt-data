Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing the maximum values of each input list `arr1`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in all input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value among all maximum values in `arr`, `arr2` is a list containing the lengths of each input list `arr1`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is the length of the first `arr1`, `ans` is incremented by the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i` for each `i` in the range of `len(arr)` and for the loop to execute one more time `i` needs to be less than `n`.**
