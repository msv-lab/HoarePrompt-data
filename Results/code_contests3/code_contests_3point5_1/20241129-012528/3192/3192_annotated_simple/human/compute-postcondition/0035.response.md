According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, and `arr1` must be updated to contain integers input by the user where `arr1[0]` is still greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is now updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1` is a list containing integers input by the user, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
