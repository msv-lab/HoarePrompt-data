According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1`. If `arr1` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr1` has at least 1 element, `j` is 1, and `temp` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, `arr1` has at least 1 element, `j` is 1**
