Example Answer:
An empty list `arr` is initialized, which will be used to store the descriptions of each company. Since no company descriptions have been added yet, the list `arr` remains empty.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies in the conglomerate. Each company description consists of an integer m_i representing the number of employees in the company, followed by m_i integers representing the salaries of the employees. Salaries are positive and do not exceed 10^9. The total number of employees in all companies does not exceed 2*10^5. `arr` is an empty list.**
