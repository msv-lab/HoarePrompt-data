Example Answer:
`maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element of `arr1` at index `i` and the previous maximum value `maxval`. Since `i` is 1 and `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `maxval` will be updated to the maximum value between the first element of `arr1` and the current `maxval`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr1`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`, and `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the first element of `arr1` and the previous `maxval`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr1`, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr1`, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`**
