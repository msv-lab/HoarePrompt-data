According to the code, the loop will execute if arr1[0] is greater than 1. Since i, j, and n are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that arr1[0] is greater than 1 and j is now 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user `arr1` and `temp`, `temp` is now initialized to 0, `maxval` is the updated maximum value in `arr1`, `arr2` is a list containing the first element of `arr1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `arr2` now contains the first element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1` is a list containing integers input by the user, arr1[0] is greater than 1**
