Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and the value at index `j` in `arr1`. Since `j` is 1, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in `arr1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in `arr1`, `arr1` has at least 1 element, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list containing integers input by the user, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value at index 1 in `arr1`, `arr1` has at least 1 element, `j` is 1**
