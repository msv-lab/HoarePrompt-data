Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the maximum salary in each company, finds the overall maximum salary, and then calculates the total increase needed to make all maximum salaries equal by iterating through each company. This ensures that the owners can merge the companies while minimizing the total increase in salaries. The program handles all potential cases within the given constraints and outputs the correct result.
