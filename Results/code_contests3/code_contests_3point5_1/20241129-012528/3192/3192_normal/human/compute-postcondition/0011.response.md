According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is at least 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to a new maximum value, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 3**
