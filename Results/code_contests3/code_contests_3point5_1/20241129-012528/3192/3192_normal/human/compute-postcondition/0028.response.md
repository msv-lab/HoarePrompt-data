Example Answer:
The first element of `arr1` is appended to the `arr2` list. Since the value of `arr1[0]` is already stored in `j`, the value of `arr2` is updated to include the first element of `arr1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`**
