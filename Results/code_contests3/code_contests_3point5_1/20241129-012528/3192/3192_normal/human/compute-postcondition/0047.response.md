According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. Since the loop increases `i` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with `n` elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from the last input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains all elements of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in the final `arr`, `ans` is initialized to 0 for the loop to execute the second time. `ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.**
