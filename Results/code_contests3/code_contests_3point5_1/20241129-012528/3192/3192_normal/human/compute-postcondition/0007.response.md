According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is 0 and `i` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and `temp` is 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
