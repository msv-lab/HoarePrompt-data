According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list and `maxval` is 0. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be greater than 0, `i` should be 0 to start with, and `arr` should have at least 1 element. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 0**
