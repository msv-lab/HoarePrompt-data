Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is reset to 0. This affects the state of `temp`, but the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`**
