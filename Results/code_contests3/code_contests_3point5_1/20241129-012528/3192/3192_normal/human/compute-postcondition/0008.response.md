Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is initialized to 0 and `arr1[j]` is a positive integer, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and the value of `arr1[j]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to a new maximum value, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to a new maximum value, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 1**
