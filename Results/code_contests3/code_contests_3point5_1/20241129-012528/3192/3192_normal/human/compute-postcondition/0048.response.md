Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` in each iteration of the loop. The initial value of `ans` is 0. The loop iterates through each element of `arr` and `arr2` simultaneously, calculating and adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` to `ans`. After the loop finishes, the new value of `ans` is the sum of all these products. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with `n` elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from the last input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains all elements of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in the final `arr`, `ans` is the calculated value after the loop completes**
