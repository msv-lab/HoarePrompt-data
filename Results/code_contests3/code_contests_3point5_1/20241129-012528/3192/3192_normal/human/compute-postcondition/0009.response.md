According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is at least 2. Since `j` is increased by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to a new maximum value, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
