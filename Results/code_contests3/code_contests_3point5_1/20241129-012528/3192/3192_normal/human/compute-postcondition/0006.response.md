Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0**
