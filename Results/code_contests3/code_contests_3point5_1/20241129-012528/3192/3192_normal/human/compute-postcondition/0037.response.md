According to the code, the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1 and `arr1[0]` should still be greater than the incremented `j`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 3, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the third time `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`.**
