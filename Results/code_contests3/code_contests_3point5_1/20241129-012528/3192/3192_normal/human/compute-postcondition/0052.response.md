Example Answer:
The code calculates the value of `ans` by summing the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each element in `arr`. The final output is printed. Since no variable values are updated in the code snippet provided, the initial states of all variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `arr`, `maxval`, `i`, `arr1`, `temp`, `j`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `ans` remain the same as the initial state**
