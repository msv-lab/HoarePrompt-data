Example Answer:
`ans` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with `n` elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from the last input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains all elements of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in the final `arr`, `ans` is initialized to 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with `n` elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from the last input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains all elements of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in the final `arr`, `ans` is initialized to 0**
