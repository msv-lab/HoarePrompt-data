According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`**
