According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `j` is set to `arr1[0] - 1`, which means `j` is currently not in the range `(1, arr1[0])`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `1` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
