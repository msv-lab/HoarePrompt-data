Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 3. Since `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, and `arr1[3]` is the fourth element in the list, the loop executes the third time. For the loop to execute the third time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3. Therefore, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`.**
