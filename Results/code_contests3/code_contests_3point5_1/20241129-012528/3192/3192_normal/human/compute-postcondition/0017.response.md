According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and it should still be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element in `arr` at index `i` and the current `maxval`**
