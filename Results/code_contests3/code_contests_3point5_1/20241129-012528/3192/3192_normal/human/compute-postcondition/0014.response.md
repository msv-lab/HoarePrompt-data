The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, which is initially equal to `maxval`. The loop executes when `arr1[0]` is at least 2, which means `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`. Therefore, after execution, the new state will be: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements (appended `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`**
