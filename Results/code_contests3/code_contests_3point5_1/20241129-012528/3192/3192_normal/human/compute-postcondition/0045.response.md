According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 0
- `j` should be updated to `arr1[0]`
- `maxval` should be updated to the maximum value in `arr`
- `ans` should remain initialized to 0

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with `n` elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from the last input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains all elements of `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in the final `arr`, `ans` is initialized to 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
