According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j` and `arr1`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. 
At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, and `arr1[0]` should be greater than the new value of `j`.
So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements (including `temp`), `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr2` contains the first and only element of `arr1`, for the loop to execute the second time `arr1[0]` is greater than 2**
