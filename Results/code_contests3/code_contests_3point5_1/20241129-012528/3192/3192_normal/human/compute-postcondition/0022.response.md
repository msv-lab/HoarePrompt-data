According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1`. If the first element of `arr1` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. In this case, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, which means `j` is one less than the first element of `arr1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` should be one less than the updated first element of `arr1` after the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between the current element in `arr1` at index `j` and the current `temp`, `j` is updated to be one less than the updated first element of `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element in `arr` at index `i` and the current `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned the list of integers converted from input split by spaces, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
