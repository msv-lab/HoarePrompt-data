According to the code, the loop can execute if the range of values from 1 to the first element of `arr1` (exclusive) is valid. In this case, `arr1[0]` is used in the loop condition, so the loop will execute as long as that value is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr1`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr2` contains the first element of `arr1`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between the current element in `arr` at index `i` and the current `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned the list of integers converted from input split by spaces, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2**
