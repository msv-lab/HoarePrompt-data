The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then processes `n` company descriptions. Each description contains the number of employees and their salaries. It calculates the maximum salary of each company and the overall maximum salary across all companies. After that, it computes a value based on the salary differences and number of employees, and finally prints the result. The function does not have a return value. However, it seems like the annotations are not completely accurate, especially regarding the calculations and indexing in the loops. There might be potential issues in the code logic that need further verification.
