Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of companies and their information as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the maximum salary of each company and the overall maximum salary across all companies.
- Then, it computes the minimal total increase of all employees that allows merging all companies.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the salaries are increased to merge companies only if the maximum salaries are equal.
