Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two inputs S and T, then it iterates through all possible rotations of T and checks if any of them matches S. If a matching rotation is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. This logic correctly implements the problem description and covers all potential cases. The code seems to be handling the rotation operation correctly and checking if S equals T after rotation as specified in the problem description.
