`s` is assigned the value `raw_input()`, which takes an input as a string. The previous values of `S` and `T` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with length between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and |S| = |T|; `s` is an input string.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with length between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and |S| = |T|; `s` is an input string**
