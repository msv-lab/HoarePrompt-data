Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two strings `S` and `T` as input, then checks if `S` equals `T` after rotation. It does this by comparing `S` with all possible rotations of `T` and prints `Yes` if they match, otherwise `No`.

The program covers all possible cases as it checks if `S` equals `T` after rotation for all rotations of `T`. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
