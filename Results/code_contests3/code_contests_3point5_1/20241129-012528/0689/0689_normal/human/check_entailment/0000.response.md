Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes two input strings `S` and `T` of equal length, consisting of lowercase English letters.
- It then checks if string `S` can be obtained by rotating string `T` and returns 'Yes' if it is possible, 'No' otherwise.
- The code loops through all possible rotations of string `T` and checks if any of them match string `S`.
- Since the program follows the problem description and the output hints correctly, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
