Example Answer:
`t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and assigns it to `t`. The variable `s` was assigned the value of the input string, but it is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the value of the input string, `t` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of the input string, `t` is assigned the input value**
