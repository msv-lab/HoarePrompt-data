Example Answer:
The code compares different rotations of the input value `t` with the input string `s` to check if any rotation matches `s`. If a match is found, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. The values of `s` and `t` are not modified during this process. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the value of the input string, `t` is assigned the input value.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of the input string, `t` is assigned the input value**
