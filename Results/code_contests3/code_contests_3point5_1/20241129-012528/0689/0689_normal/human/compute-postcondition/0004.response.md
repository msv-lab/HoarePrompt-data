Functionality: **The function `func` takes two input strings `S` and `T` of equal length, consisting of lowercase English letters. It then checks if string `S` can be obtained by rotating string `T` and returns 'Yes' if it is possible, 'No' otherwise. The function may not handle edge cases where `S` cannot be formed by rotating `T` due to incomplete rotations or incorrect string lengths.**
