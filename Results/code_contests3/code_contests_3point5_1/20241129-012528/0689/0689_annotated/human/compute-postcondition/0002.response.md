Example Answer: 
The code checks if there exists a rotation of string `t` that is equal to string `s`. It loops through all possible rotations of string `t` and checks if any of them are equal to string `s`. If a rotation of string `t` is equal to string `s`, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The values of the variables `S` and `T` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T|; `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T|; `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user**
