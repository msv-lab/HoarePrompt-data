Example Answer:
The value of `t` is assigned the input string entered by the user using `raw_input()`. Since `s` is not used in the provided code snippet, the value of `s` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of the string X; `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of the string X; `s` is a string input by the user, `t` is a string input by the user**
