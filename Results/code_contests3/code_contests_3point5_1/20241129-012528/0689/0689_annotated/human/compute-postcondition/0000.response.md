Example Answer:
The value of variable `s` is assigned the input received from the user using `raw_input()`. Since the initial state does not specify any particular value for `s`, the output state will be: S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of the string X; `s` is a string input by the user.
Output State: **S and T are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and |S| = |T| where |X| denotes the length of the string X; `s` is a string input by the user**
