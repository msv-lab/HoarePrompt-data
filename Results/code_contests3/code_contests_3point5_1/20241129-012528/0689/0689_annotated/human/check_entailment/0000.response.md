Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two strings `s` and `t` as input, and then checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t`. It does this by checking if any rotation of string `t` is equal to string `s`. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The program covers all possible cases and follows the requirements of the problem description.
