Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if string S equals string T after rotation. It checks for every possible rotation of string T and compares it with string S. If any rotation of T is equal to S, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No". The program handles all potential cases and works as expected according to the problem description.
