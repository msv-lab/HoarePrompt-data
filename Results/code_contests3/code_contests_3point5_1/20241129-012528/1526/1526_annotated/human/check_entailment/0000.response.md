Correctness: **True**

The program reads an input string `w`, creates a dictionary `memo` with the frequency of each unique character in `w`, and then checks if all the frequencies are even. If all frequencies are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This exactly matches the problem description which requires determining if each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in `w`. Therefore, the program is correct.
