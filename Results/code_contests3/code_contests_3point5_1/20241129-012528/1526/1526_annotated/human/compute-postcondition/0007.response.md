According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least one character, and `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one character left in `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least one character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value incremented by 1**
