According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the dictionary `memo`. If there are more values in the dictionary, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with no characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `result` is True. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more values in the dictionary `memo`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with no characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 key-value pairs, `result` is True**
