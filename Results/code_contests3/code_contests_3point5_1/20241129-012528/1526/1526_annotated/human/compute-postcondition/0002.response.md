According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the input string `s`. Before the loop starts, the input string `s` is provided, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must contain at least one character, and `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with at least one character, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
