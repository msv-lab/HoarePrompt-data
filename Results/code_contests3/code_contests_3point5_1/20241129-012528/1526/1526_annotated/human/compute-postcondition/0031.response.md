Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True, otherwise 'No'. In this case, `result` is True, so 'Yes' is printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with no characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the values are all even, `result` is True**.
