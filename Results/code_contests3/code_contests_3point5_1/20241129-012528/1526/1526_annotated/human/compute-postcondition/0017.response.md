According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least 1 value, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters and `s` being an input string with no characters left does not directly impact the loop execution. The initial state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted so that `memo` has at least 1 value. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, there must be at least 1 key-value pair in `memo`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string with no characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 key-value pair, `result` is True**
