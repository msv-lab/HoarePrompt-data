Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is assigned 0, which means the value associated with key `c` in the dictionary `memo` is now 0. If `c` was not already in the dictionary, its value would be incremented by 1. The initial state tells us that `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c`, so after execution, the value associated with key `c` in the dictionary `memo` is 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least one character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` having the value of 0**
