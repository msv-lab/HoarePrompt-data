According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` still has characters remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least one character remaining, and `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value is incremented by 1 if `c` was not already in the dictionary. Since the loop is iterating through `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still have characters remaining.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least one character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` and the value is incremented by 1 if `c` was not already in the dictionary**
