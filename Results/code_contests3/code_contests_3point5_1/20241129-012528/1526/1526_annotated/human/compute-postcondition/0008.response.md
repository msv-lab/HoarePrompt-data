Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. The value of `c` is not specified in the initial state, but it is mentioned that `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, the value of `memo[c]` becomes 0. The states of `w` and `s` remain the same. 
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` has at least one character remaining, `memo` is a dictionary with key `c` and value 0**
