Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an input string `s`, then creates a dictionary `memo` where keys are unique characters in `s` and values represent the frequency of each character. It then checks if all frequencies in `memo` are even. If all frequencies are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
