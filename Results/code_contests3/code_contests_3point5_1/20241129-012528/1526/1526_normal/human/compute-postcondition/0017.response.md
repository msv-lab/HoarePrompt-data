According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are values in the `memo` dictionary. Therefore, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute is that `memo` should not be empty. Additionally, since `memo` is a dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, the loop will iterate over each value in `memo.values()`. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, `result` is True, for the loop to execute there are values in `memo.values()`**
