Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, `result` is True. The loop will make `result` False if any value in `memo.values()` is odd. If all values in `memo.values()` are even, `result` will remain True.**
