According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if all values in `memo.values()` are even. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, `result` is True. If x % 2 > 0, `result` becomes False. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be values in `memo.values()` that are all even.
