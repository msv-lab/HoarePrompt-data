According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair added if `c` was not already present in it and the value of `c` is incremented by 1 if it already existed in the dictionary. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the string `s` needs to be considered. So, for the loop to execute another time, the string `s` should have at least one more character to iterate over, and the state of `w`, `s`, and `memo` should be maintained.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `memo` is a dictionary with the appropriate key-value pairs based on the previous iterations**
