Example Answer:
The code snippet increments the value associated with the key 'c' in the dictionary `memo` by 1. If the key 'c' is not present in `memo`, a new key-value pair is added with the key 'c' and value 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `memo` is a dictionary with the appropriate key-value pairs based on the previous iterations where the value associated with the key 'c' has been incremented by 1.
