Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, `result` is True. If x % 2 > 0, `result` becomes False, and for the loop to execute one more time, there must be values in `memo.values()` that are all even, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
