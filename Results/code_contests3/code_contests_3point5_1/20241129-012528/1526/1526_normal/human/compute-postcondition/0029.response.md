Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, `result` is True. If the count of characters in `memo.values()` is all even, the loop executes one more time. Otherwise, the loop breaks and `result` becomes False.***
