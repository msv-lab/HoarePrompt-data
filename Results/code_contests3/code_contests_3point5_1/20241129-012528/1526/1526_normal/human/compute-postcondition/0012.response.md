Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is assigned the value of 0. The dictionary `memo` contains key-value pairs where the value associated with the key 'c' has been incremented by 1 in previous iterations, but now all values are reset to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with all values reset to 0.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `memo` is a dictionary with all values reset to 0**
