Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. Since `c` is not in `memo`, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary `memo` with key `c` and value 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair added.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair added**
