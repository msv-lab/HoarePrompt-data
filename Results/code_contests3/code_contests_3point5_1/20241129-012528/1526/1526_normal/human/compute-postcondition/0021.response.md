Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary representing the frequencies of characters in `s`, `result` is True. For the loop to execute, there are values in `memo.values()`. If x % 2 > 0, `result` is False, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
