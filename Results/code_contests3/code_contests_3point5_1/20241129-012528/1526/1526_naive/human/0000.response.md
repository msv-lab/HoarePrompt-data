Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input string `w`, counts the occurrences of each lowercase letter, and checks if each letter occurs an even number of times. If any letter occurs an odd number of times, the program sets the result to False. The program then prints 'Yes' if the result is True (indicating that `w` is beautiful) and 'No' otherwise. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases where `w` may or may not be beautiful.
