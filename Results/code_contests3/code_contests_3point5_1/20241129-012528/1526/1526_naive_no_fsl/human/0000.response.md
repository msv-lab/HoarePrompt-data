Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each lowercase letter in the input string and then checks if each letter occurs an even number of times. If so, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and all potential cases have been considered.
