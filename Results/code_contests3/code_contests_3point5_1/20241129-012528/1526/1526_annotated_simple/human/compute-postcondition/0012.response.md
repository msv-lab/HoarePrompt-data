Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is assigned 0. The key `c` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that `c` is a character in the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is either 1 or 2, and a new key `c` with a value of 0 has been added to `memo`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is either 1 or 2, and a new key `c` with a value of 0 has been added to `memo`**
