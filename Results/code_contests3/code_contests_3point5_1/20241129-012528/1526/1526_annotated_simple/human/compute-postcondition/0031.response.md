Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'Yes' if the value of `result` is True and 'No' if the value of `result` is False. The values of `w`, `s`, and `memo` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the values are all even, and the value of `result` determines whether 'Yes' or 'No' is printed.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the values are all even, and the value of `result` determines whether 'Yes' or 'No' is printed**
