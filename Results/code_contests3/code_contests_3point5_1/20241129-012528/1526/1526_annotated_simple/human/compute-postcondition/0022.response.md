According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more values in the dictionary, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `result` is either True or False. For the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more values in the `memo` dictionary.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with more than one key-value pair, `result` is either True or False**
