According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If there are more characters left in the string `s`, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is either 1 or 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character in `s` must still exist. Therefore, the state for the next iteration should be:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters left, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is either 1 or 2**
