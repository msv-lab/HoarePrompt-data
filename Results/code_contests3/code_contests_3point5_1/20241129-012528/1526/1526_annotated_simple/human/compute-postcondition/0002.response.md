According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be empty. Before the loop starts, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string accepted as raw input, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `s` should not be empty, `c` should be the first character in `s`.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character in `s`**
