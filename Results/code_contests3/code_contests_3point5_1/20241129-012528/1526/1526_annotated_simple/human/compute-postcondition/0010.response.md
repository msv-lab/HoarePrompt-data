Example Answer: 
`memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` is in `memo` and its value is 1, then after execution `memo[c]` becomes 2. Otherwise, if `c` is not in `memo`, then it is added to `memo` with value 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is either 1 or 2**
