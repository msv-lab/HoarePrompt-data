According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If there are more key-value pairs left in the dictionary, the loop will execute another time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with more than one key-value pair, and `result` is either True or False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the `memo` dictionary must have at least one key-value pair left to iterate over.
