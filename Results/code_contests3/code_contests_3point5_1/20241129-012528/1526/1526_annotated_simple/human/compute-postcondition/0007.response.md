According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` where `c` is the first character in `s` and its value is 1.
So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `s` will be considered. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be as follows:
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is 1**
