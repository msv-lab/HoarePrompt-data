Example Answer:
The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `memo[c]` is 0. Therefore, after execution, the value of `memo[c]` becomes 1. The states of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with the key `c` where `c` is the first character in `s` and its value is 1.**
