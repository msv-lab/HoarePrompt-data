Example Answer:
`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. The previous state of `memo` does not provide information on the key `c`, so after execution, `memo[c]` is set to `0`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with the key next character in `s` where its value is 1, `memo[c]` is 0**
