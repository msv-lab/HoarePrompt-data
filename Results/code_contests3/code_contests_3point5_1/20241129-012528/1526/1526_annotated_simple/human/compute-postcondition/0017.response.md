According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least one key-value pair, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `memo` has at least one key-value pair. For the loop to execute the first time, let's say the first key in `memo` is 'a' with a value of 1.
State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time the first key in `memo` is 'a' with a value of 1**
