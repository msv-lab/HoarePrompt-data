Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly determines if a given string `w` is beautiful by checking if each lowercase letter in the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in the string. It achieves this by creating a dictionary `memo` to store the count of each character in the string `s`, then iterating through the values in the dictionary to check if each count is even. If any count is odd, it sets the result to False, otherwise, it remains True. Finally, it prints 'Yes' if the result is True and 'No' if the result is False.

The program follows the problem description accurately and will always output 'Yes' if the input string is beautiful and 'No' if it is not.
