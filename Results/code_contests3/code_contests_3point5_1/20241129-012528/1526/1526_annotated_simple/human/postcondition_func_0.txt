The function func_1 reads a string `s` as input, creates a dictionary `memo` to store the count of each unique character in `s`, and then checks if the count of all characters in `s` is even. If all counts are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function operates on a string `w` consisting of lowercase letters.
