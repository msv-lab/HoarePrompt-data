Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of the square root of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, `x` will be an integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N**
