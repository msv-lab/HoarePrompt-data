Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `N` is a positive integer, the value of `n` will be a positive integer within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6**
