Example Answer:
The program prints the value of 'answr'. The value of 'answr' is determined based on some conditions not provided in the code snippet. Since the conditions are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of 'answr'. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, 'answr' is an integer value based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, 'answr' is an integer value based on the conditions mentioned above**
