Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N. If the square of x is equal to N, 'answr' is 4 times the value of x. If the square of x is not equal to N and x * (x + 1) > N, 'answr' is calculated accordingly. If x * (x + 1) ≤ N, 'answr' is set to 4 * (x + 1)***
