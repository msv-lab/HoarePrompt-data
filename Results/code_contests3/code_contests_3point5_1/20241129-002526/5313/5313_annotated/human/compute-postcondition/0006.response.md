Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `N`. The square of `x` is not equal to `N`, and the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `N`, so the value of `answr` is `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, the square of x is not equal to N, the product of x and x+1 is greater than N, and answr is calculated as described.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, the square of x is not equal to N, the product of x and x+1 is greater than N, and answr is calculated as described**.
