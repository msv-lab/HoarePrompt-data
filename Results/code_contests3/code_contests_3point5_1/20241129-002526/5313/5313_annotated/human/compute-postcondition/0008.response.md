Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`, where `x` represents the square root of `N`. Since the square of `x` is not equal to `N`, and `x * (x + 1) <= N`, the value of `answr` can be calculated based on the value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, the square of x is not equal to N, x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to N; `answr` is the result of the calculation 4 * (x + 1).
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, the square of x is not equal to N, x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to N; `answr` is the result of the calculation 4 * (x + 1)**
