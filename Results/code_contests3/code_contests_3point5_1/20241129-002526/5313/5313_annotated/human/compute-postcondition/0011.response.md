Example Answer:
The value of 'answr' is converted to an integer. The value of 'answr' can be 4 times the value of x, or calculated based on the conditions mentioned. 
If the square of x is equal to N, 'answr' is 4 times the value of x.
If the square of x is not equal to N and x * (x + 1) > N, 'answr' is calculated accordingly.
If x * (x + 1) ≤ N, 'answr' is set to 4 * (x + 1).
Therefore, the Output State is: *N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, 'answr' is an integer value based on the conditions mentioned above.
Output State: ***N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, x is an integer representing the square root of N, 'answr' is an integer value based on the conditions mentioned above***
