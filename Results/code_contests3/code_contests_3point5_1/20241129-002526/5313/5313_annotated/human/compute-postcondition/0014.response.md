Functionality: **The function takes user input for a positive integer N, calculates a value based on the square root of N, and prints the result. If the square of the square root of N is equal to N, the function calculates the result as 4 times the square root of N. If the square of the square root of N is not equal to N and x * (x + 1) is greater than N, the result is calculated accordingly. If x * (x + 1) is less than or equal to N, the result is set to 4 times (x + 1). The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
