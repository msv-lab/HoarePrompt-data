Correctness: **True**

The program takes a positive integer N as input, calculates the square root of N, and then determines the minimum perimeter that can be achieved to enclose N city blocks. It follows the problem description by checking if the square of the square root of N is equal to N, in which case it calculates the perimeter as 4 times the square root of N. If the square of the square root of N is not equal to N, it checks if x * (x + 1) is greater than N and calculates the perimeter accordingly, otherwise it calculates the perimeter as 4 times (x + 1). The program outputs the correct result for all possible cases as described in the problem description.
