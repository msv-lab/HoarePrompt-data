Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter that can be achieved to enclose exactly N city blocks. It first calculates the square root of N, then checks if the square of the square root is equal to N. If it is, the perimeter is calculated accordingly. If not, it calculates the perimeter based on other conditions which also align with the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output for each scenario described in the problem statement.
