Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum perimeter required to enclose the given number of city blocks as described in the problem. The logic used in the program accounts for different scenarios based on the value of the input integer `n` and calculates the minimum perimeter accordingly. 

The program first calculates the square root of the input integer `n` and then checks if the square of this value is equal to `n`. If it is, the minimum perimeter is calculated as `x * 4`. If not, it further checks if `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`. If it is, then the minimum perimeter is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`, otherwise it is calculated as `4 * (x + 1)`.

Therefore, the program always provides the correct minimum perimeter required to enclose the given number of city blocks as specified in the problem description.
