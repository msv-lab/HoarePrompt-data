Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is an input integer. The value of `x` is calculated by taking the square root of `n` and converting it to an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer**
