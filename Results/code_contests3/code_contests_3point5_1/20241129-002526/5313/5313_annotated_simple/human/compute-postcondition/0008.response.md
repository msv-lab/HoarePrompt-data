Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value 4 * (x + 1), where `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer. The conditions given indicate that the square of `x` is not equal to `n` and that the product of `x` and `x + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the value of `x` and subsequently the value of `answr` can be calculated based on these conditions.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer, `answr` is the result of 4 * (x + 1)**
