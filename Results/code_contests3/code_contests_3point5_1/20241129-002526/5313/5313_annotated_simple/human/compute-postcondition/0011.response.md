Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value `int(answr)`, where `int` converts the value of `answr` to an integer. The previous values of the variables are `N` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer, `answr` is an integer value**
