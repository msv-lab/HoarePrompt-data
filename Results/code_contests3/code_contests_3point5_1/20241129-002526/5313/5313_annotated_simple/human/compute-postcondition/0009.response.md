Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer, and the square of `x` is not equal to `n`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated based on the given conditions. Otherwise, `answr` is the result of 4 * (x + 1)***
