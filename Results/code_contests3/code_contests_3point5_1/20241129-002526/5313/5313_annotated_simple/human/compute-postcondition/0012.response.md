Example Answer:
`print(answr)` will output the current value of `answr`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `answr`, so the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **`N` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer, `answr` is an integer value**
