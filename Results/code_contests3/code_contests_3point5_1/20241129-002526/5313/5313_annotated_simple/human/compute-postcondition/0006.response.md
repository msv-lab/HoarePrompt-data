Example Answer:
`answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`, where `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer. The conditions given about `x` and `n` indicate that the value of `x` is valid and the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`. Therefore, `answr` will be calculated accordingly.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer. The square of `x` is not equal to `n`. The product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `n`, `answr` is calculated based on the given conditions.**
