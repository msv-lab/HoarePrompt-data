Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the square root of `n` converted to an integer. If x ** 2 == n, then `answr` is equal to 4 times the square root of `n`. If x ** 2 is not equal to `n` and `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated based on the given conditions. Otherwise, `answr` is the result of 4 * (x + 1)***
