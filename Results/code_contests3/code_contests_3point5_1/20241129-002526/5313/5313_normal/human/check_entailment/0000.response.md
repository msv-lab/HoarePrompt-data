Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes an integer input `n`, calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`, and based on certain conditions, computes a value for `answr` that represents the minimum perimeter that can be achieved. 
1. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` is set to `x * 4`, which represents the minimum perimeter when forming a square with side length `x`.
2. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, `answr` is calculated accordingly to form a rectangle with dimensions `x` and `x + 1`.
3. Otherwise, `answr` is set to 4 times the sum of `x` and 1, which represents the minimum perimeter when forming a rectangle with dimensions `x + 1` and `x`.

The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given examples. The logic is sound and covers all possible scenarios for determining the minimum perimeter required to enclose the specified number of city blocks.
