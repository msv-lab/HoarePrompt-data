Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any positive integer between 1 and 10^6. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6.
Output State: **N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6**
