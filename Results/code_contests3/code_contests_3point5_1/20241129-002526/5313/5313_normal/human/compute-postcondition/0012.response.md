Example Answer:
If the square of `x` is equal to `N`, `answr` is equal to `N * 4`. If `x * (x + 1) > N`, `answr` is the result of the calculation. Otherwise, `answr` is 4 times the sum of the integer square root of `N` and 1.
The value of `answr` is then printed. The initial state does not provide the values of `x` and `N`, so the specific value of `answr` cannot be determined without knowing `x` and `N`.
Output State: **Specific output cannot be determined without the values of `x` and `N`**
