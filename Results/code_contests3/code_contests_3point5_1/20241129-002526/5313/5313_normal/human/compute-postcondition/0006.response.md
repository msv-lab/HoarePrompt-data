Example Answer:
The value of `answr` is calculated by multiplying `(x + x + 1)` by `2`. Since `x` is the integer square root of `N`, the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `N`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `N`, the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `N`, and `answr` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `N`, the product of `x` and `x+1` is greater than `N`, `answr` is the result of the calculation**
