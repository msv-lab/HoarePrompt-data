Example Answer: 
`answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. Given that the product of `x` and `(x+1)` is less than or equal to `N`, we can calculate `x` and substitute it into the equation. We know that `x` is the integer square root of `N`, so we can calculate `x` using this information. Therefore, `answr` can be calculated as `4 * (sqrt(N) + 1)`. 
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `N`, `answr` is 4 times the sum of the integer square root of `N` and 1.**
