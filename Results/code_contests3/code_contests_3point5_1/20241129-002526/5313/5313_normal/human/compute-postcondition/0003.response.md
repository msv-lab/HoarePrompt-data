Example Answer:
The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`, where `x` is the integer square root of `N`. Since the square of `x` is equal to `N`, `answr` is equal to `N * 4`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `N`, and the square of `x` is equal to `N`, `answr` is equal to `N * 4.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, `x` is the integer square root of `N`, and the square of `x` is equal to `N`, `answr` is equal to `N * 4**.
