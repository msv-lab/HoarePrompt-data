The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the integer square root `x` of `n`, and based on certain conditions, computes a value for `answr`. If the square of `x` is equal to `n`, `answr` is set to `n * 4`. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, `answr` is calculated accordingly. Otherwise, `answr` is set to 4 times the sum of `x` and 1. The final value of `answr` is then converted to an integer and printed. The function does not have any specified return value.
