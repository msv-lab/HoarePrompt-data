The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the predefined parameter constraints mentioned above: n, V, ai, and bi are positive integers representing the number of ingredients, volume of the pan, proportions, and available amounts of ingredients respectively. The function should calculate and return the total amount of each ingredient needed to fill the pan to the desired volume V based on the proportions ai and available amounts bi.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates and returns the total amount of each ingredient needed to fill the pan to the desired volume V based on the proportions ai and available amounts bi.**
