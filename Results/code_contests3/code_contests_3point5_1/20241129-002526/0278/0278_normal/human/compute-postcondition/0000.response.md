Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned values by mapping the integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n` and `V` are positive integers representing the number of ingredients and the volume of the pan respectively. The variables `ai` and `bi` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of ingredients, V is a positive integer representing the volume of the pan, ai and bi are positive integers representing the proportions and available amounts of ingredients respectively.**
