Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The program is not correctly calculating the total amount of each ingredient needed to fill the pan to the desired volume V based on the proportions and available amounts. The code seems to have a complex logic that may not accurately represent the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also suggest that the code may not be handling all scenarios correctly. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
