Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values of the input after converting them to float. The input is split and converted to float values. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `ai` and `bi` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100, `a` and `b` are lists of float values.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `ai` and `bi` are non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100, `a` and `b` are lists of float values**
