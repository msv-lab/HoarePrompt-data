Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description by correctly calculating the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the provided input values. The program reads the input values for n, V, ai, and bi, and then calculates the volume of soup using a complex nested calculation involving min, reduce, zip, and lambda functions. The final result is printed as the output, which is the volume of soup that Volodya will cook.

The program is designed to handle all potential cases within the specified constraints, ensuring that it always produces the correct output based on the problem description.
