Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values for n, V, ai, and bi. It then calculates the minimum volume of soup that can be cooked based on the ingredients available and the proportion needed. The program uses lambda functions and zip to iterate over the ingredients and calculate the minimum volume of soup that can be cooked. Finally, it compares this value with the maximum volume allowed in the pan and prints the result. The program logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the correct volume of soup is calculated.
