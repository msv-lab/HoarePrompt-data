Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the list of float values obtained by splitting the input. Similarly, `b` is assigned the list of float values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input given, which are non-negative integers. Therefore, the Output State is:  `n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000; `ai` and `bi` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= ai, bi <= 100; `a` is a list of float values based on input; `b` is a list of float values based on input.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000; `ai` and `bi` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= ai, bi <= 100; `a` is a list of float values based on input; `b` is a list of float values based on input**
