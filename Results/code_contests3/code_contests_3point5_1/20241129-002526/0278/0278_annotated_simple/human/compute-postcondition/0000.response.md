Example Answer:
`n` and `V` are assigned values based on the input received from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The values are split based on spaces, converted to integers, and assigned to `n` and `V`. The ranges for `n` and `V` are provided, so they fall within the valid range. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000; ai and bi are non-negative integers such that 1 <= ai, bi <= 100.
Output State: **`n` and `V` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 20 and 1 <= V <= 10000; ai and bi are non-negative integers such that 1 <= ai, bi <= 100**
