Correctness: **True**

The program takes the input values for n, V, ai, and bi as described in the problem description. It then calculates the volume of soup that Volodya will cook based on the given ingredients and proportions, ensuring that the volume does not exceed the V litres limit.

The program correctly calculates the volume of soup by iterating over the ingredients and proportions using the zip function, and then finding the minimum ratio of available ingredients to required ingredients. It then multiplies this minimum ratio by the corresponding ingredient amount to get the total volume of soup that can be cooked. Finally, it compares this total volume with the V litres limit and prints the minimum of the two.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly determines the volume of soup that Volodya will cook.
