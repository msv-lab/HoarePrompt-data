Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values, calculates the minimum of the proportion of each ingredient available and the corresponding ingredient needed, then multiplies it by the amount of that ingredient to get the maximum amount of soup that can be cooked. This process is repeated for each ingredient and the final result is the minimum of all these values and the volume of the pan. The logic seems to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
