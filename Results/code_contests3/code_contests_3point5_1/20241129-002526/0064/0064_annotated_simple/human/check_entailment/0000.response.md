Correctness: **True**

The program takes input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It then calculates the total sum of coins and checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If it is, then it outputs the initial bet size (total sum divided by number of players), otherwise it outputs -1.

The program follows the problem description accurately by determining the initial bet size b based on the given final number of coins each player has. It covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
