Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the sum of the values in the list `c`, where `c` contains the values of c1, c2, c3, c4, c5. Since c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers between 0 and 100, the sum of these values will also be an integer between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 500.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 500**
