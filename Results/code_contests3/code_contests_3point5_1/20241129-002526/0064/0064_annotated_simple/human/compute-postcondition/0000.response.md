Example Answer:
The variable `c` is assigned the result of mapping the integers obtained from splitting the raw input. However, the initial states of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100**
