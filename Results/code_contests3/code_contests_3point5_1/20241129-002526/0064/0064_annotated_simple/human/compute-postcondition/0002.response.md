Example Answer:
The code checks if s is equal to 0 or if s divided by the length of the list c has a remainder. If either condition is true, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of s divided by the length of c. Since the initial state does not provide the values of the list c, we cannot calculate the exact output. Therefore, the Output State is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 500.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100; s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 500**
