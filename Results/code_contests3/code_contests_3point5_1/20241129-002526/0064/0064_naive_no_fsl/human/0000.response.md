Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes the input of the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the total sum of coins, and then checks if the sum is divisible by the number of players. If it is, then it outputs the initial bet size (sum divided by the number of players), otherwise it outputs -1.

The program follows the problem description accurately and covers all potential cases. It correctly determines the initial bet size or indicates if there is no possible initial bet size for the given final number of coins each player has.
