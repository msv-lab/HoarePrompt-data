Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of applying the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. However, since `map` does not directly return a list, we cannot determine the exact values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`. Therefore, the output state is: c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100**
