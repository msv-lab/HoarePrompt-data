Functionality: **The function `func` reads a list of integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers in the list, and prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the length of the list, or the average of the integers in the list if the sum is non-zero and divisible by the length of the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
