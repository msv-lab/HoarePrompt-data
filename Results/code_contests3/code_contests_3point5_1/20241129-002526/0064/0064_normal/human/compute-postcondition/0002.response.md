Example Answer:
The code checks if the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` is 0 or not divisible by the number of elements in the list `c`. If the condition is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the elements in `c`. Since `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`, it will be used to determine the output.
Output State: **If the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` is 0 or not divisible by 5, print -1. Otherwise, print the average of the elements in `c`.**
