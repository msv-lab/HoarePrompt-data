Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the user input, calculates the sum of the integers in the list, and prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the length of the list, or the average of the integers in the list if the sum is non-zero and divisible by the length of the list. The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. The code covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
