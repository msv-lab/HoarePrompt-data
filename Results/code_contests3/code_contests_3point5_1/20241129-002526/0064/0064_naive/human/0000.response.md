Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the sum of coins held by all players and then checks if the total sum is divisible by the number of players. If it is divisible, then it calculates and prints the initial bet value (sum divided by the number of players). If the total sum is 0 or not divisible by the number of players, it prints -1. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and edge cases, making it correct.
