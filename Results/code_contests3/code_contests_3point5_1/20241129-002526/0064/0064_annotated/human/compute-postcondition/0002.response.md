Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the average of the values in `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` stored in variable `s`. If `s` is 0 or not divisible by the number of elements (5 in this case), it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the average. The initial state shows that `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, and `s` is the sum of these values, which is between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` which is between 0 and 500.**
