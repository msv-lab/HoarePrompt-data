Functionality: **The function `func` reads input integers, calculates the sum of those integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of input integers, or the average of the input integers if the sum is non-zero and divisible by the number of inputs. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
