Example Answer:
The variable `s` is assigned the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. Since `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the sum `s` will be between 0 and 500. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` which is between 0 and 500.
Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` which is between 0 and 500**
