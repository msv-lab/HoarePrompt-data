Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which reads input values, splits them, and converts them to integers. Since the initial state does not specify the values of c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, the output state will be dependent on the input provided at runtime.
Output State: **c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100 based on the input provided**.
