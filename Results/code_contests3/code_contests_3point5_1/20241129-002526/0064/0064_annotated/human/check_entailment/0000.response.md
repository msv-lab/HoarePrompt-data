Correctness: **True**

The program reads input integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, calculates the sum of those integers, and then prints either -1 if the sum is zero or not divisible by the number of input integers, or the average of the input integers if the sum is non-zero and divisible by the number of inputs. This aligns with the problem description, as it determines the initial bet size 'b' based on the final number of coins each player has. The program covers all possible cases and outputs the correct result.
