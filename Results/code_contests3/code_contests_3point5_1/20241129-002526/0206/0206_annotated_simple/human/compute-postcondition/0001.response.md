Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input string after splitting it. Since the input is a string, after splitting it, `a` becomes a list of strings. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a string input, `a` is a list of strings.
Output State: **N is a string input, `a` is a list of strings**
