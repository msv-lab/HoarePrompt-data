Example Answer:
The `np.abs` function calculates the absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. Since the initial state of `a` is a list of strings, we cannot directly find the maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the output state is: N is a string input, `a` is a list of strings. 
Output State: **N is a string input, `a` is a list of strings**
