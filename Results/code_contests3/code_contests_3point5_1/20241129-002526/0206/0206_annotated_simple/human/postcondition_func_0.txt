The function reads input from the user for a list of numbers, calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, and prints the result. It does not accept any parameters, and there is no specific output or return value. The annotations mention the use of `raw_input()` and `np.abs()`, but the code does not actually import any libraries or define the `np` variable, which could lead to errors in execution. Additionally, the annotations do not cover error handling for cases where the input is not valid or if the list of numbers is empty.
