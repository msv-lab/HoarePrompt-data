Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
2. The program does not convert the input values to integers before performing calculations. It should use `map(int, input().split())` to convert the input values to integers.
3. The program uses `np.abs()`, `np.max()`, and `np.min()` functions which are not defined without importing the numpy library. The program should import numpy and use `np.abs`, `np.max`, and `np.min` properly.

Overall, the program does not follow the problem description and will not provide the correct output for the given problem.
