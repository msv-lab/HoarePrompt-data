Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `N` elements and each element `a_i` is an integer between 0 and 1000, the maximum and minimum values are also within that range. Therefore, the value of `ans` will be in the range of 0 to 1000. 
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, `ans` is an integer between 0 and 1000**
