Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` using NumPy functions and prints the result. The function assumes `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the elements in `a` are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 <= i <= N. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
