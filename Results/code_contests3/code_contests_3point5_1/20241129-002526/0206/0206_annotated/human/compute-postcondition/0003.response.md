Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `ans`. The values of `N`, `a_i`, and `ans` are not modified by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, `ans` is an integer between 0 and 1000.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a_i` are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 <= i <= N, `ans` is an integer between 0 and 1000**
