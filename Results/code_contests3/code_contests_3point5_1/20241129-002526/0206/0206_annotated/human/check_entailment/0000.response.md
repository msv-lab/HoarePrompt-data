Correctness: **True**

The annotated program reads the input integer N and a list of integers a from the user, then calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list a using NumPy functions, and finally prints the result. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the minimum distance to be traveled between houses. The program correctly finds this minimum distance and outputs it.
