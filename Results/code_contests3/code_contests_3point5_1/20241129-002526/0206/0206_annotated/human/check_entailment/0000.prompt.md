You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It is only six months until Christmas, and AtCoDeer the reindeer is now planning his travel to deliver gifts.
There are N houses along TopCoDeer street. The i-th house is located at coordinate a_i. He has decided to deliver gifts to all these houses.
Find the minimum distance to be traveled when AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions.

Constraints

* 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
* 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000
* a_i is an integer.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_1 a_2 ... a_N


Output

Print the minimum distance to be traveled.

Examples

Output

8
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and a_i are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 <= i <= N.**
def func():
    N = raw_input()
    a = raw_input().split()
    ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` using NumPy functions and prints the result. The function assumes `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the elements in `a` are integers between 0 and 1000 for 1 <= i <= N. The function does not explicitly return a value.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
