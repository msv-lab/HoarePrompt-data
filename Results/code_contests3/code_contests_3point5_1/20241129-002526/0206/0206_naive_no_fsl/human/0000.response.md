Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not calculate the minimum distance to be traveled as per the problem description. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach would involve finding the minimum distance to be traveled by considering all possible start and end positions.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
