Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the input values are not integers. The program assumes that the input values are integers, but since it uses `raw_input()` which reads input as strings, it may not work correctly for non-integer inputs. For example, if the input is "4\n2 3 7 9.5", the program will not give the correct output because it expects integers but encounters a float value.
