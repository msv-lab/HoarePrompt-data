Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(ans)` prints the value stored in the variable `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`. The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of strings, so the program will first need to convert the strings in `a` to numbers to calculate the maximum and minimum values. Once the maximum and minimum values are found, the absolute difference between them will be calculated and stored in `ans`. Finally, the code snippet `print(ans)` will output this value.
Output State: **The absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` is printed.**
