Example Answer:
The code snippet `a = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings. Since the initial state specifies that N is a positive integer, and a_i are integers, the output state after the execution of this code would be that variable `a` is a list of strings containing the input values.
Output State: **variable `a` is a list of strings containing the input values**
