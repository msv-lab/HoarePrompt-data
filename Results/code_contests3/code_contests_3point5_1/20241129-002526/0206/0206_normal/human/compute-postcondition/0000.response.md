Example Answer:
N is assigned the value of raw_input(), which is a string. The value of N can be any positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: N is a positive integer and a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N.
Output State: **N is a positive integer and a_i are integers such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for 1 ≤ i ≤ N**
