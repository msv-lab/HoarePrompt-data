Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code is not correctly following the problem description as it is not calculating the minimum distance to be traveled when AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions. Instead, it is calculating the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the input integers.
- The output hints correctly point out that the code lacks the import of the numpy library and error handling for unexpected input formats or ranges. This also contributes to the incorrectness of the code.
- Therefore, the code does not handle the specific requirements outlined in the problem description and is considered incorrect.
