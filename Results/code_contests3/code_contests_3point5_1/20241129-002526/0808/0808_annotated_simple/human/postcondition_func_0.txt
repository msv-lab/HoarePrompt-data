The function initializes a list `a` of 1000000 elements with all values set to True. It then iterates over the range from 2 to 999,999 and marks non-prime indices in the list `a` as False based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. After that, it attempts to read input from the standard input and prints the count of True values in the list `a` from index 1 to n-1 for each input line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
