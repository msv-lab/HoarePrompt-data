Example Answer: 
The element at index `j'` in list `a` is set to `False` where `j'` is the next value that satisfies the range condition `j in range(i, len(a))`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: The element at index `j'` in list `a` is set to `False` where `j'` is the next value that satisfies the range condition `j in range(i, len(a))`.
Output State: **The element at index `j'` in list `a` is set to `False` where `j'` is the next value that satisfies the range condition `j in range(i, len(a))**.
