Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to `True` and all other elements set to `False`, `i` is 3. If the element at index 2 in list `a` is `True`, the loop can execute a third time. If `a[i - 1]` is `True`, all elements in `a` at indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are set to `False`.***
