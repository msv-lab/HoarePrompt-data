According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if the range provided is valid. Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is set to 2 which is enough for the loop to execute. So, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements all set to `True`, `i` is 2, the element at index `i - 1` in list `a` is `True`, for the loop to execute `j` is set to `i ** 2 - 1`**
