Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to `True` and all other elements set to `False`, `i` is 2. If the element at index `i - 1` (prime index) is `True`, then the program continues. Otherwise, the program exits without further changes.***
