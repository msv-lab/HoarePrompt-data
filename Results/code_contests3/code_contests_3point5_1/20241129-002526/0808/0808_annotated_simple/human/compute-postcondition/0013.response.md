Example Answer:
The code snippet `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in list `a`. Since `j` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine the exact index affected. However, we do know that the loop is executing the third time, so the element at index 8 in list `a` is `True`. After executing the code snippet, the element at the index `j` will be set to `False`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to `True` and all other elements set to `False`, `i` is 3, the element at index 8 in list `a` is `True`, the element at index `j` in list `a` is `False`**.
