According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `a[j]` is `True`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `i` and should be less than 1000000. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` should be updated to `j + i`, and `a[j]` should still be `True`.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with the element at index `i - 1` set to `True` and all other elements set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `a[j]` is `True`**
