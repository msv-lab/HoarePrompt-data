Example Answer: 
The element at index `j` in list `a` is set to `False` after executing the code. The initial state of the element at index `j` was `True`, and `j` satisfies the loop condition. Therefore, after running the code, the element at index `j` in list `a` is set to `False`.
Output State: **The element at index `j` in list `a` is set to `False`**
