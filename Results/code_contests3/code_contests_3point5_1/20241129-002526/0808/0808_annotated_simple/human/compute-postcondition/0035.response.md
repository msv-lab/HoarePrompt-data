Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to `True`, all other elements set to `False`, `i` is 1000000, the element at index i - 1 in list 'a' is True, and there is still more input from sys.stdin for the loop to execute another time. The code prints the count of True values in list `a` from index 1 to `int(s)` (excluding `int(s)`).**
