Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads an integer n and prints the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to n. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to 999,999 and then counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n. The program is designed to handle multiple datasets and print the output for each dataset separately. The algorithm used in the program ensures that only prime numbers are counted, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
