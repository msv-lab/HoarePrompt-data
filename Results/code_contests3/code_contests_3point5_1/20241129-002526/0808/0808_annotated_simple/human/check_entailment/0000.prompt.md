You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a program which reads an integer n and prints the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to n. A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first four prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5 and 7.



Input

Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset has an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) in a line.

The number of datasets is less than or equal to 30.

Output

For each dataset, prints the number of prime numbers.

Example

Input

10
3
11


Output

4
2
5
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999.**
def func():
    a = [True] * 1000000
    for i in range(2, 1000000):
        if a[i - 1]:
            for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
                a[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to `True` and all other elements set to `False`, `i` is 1000000. If the element at index `i - 1` (prime index) is `True`, then the program continues. Otherwise, the program exits without further changes.
    for s in sys.stdin:
        print(a[1:int(s)].count(True))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` contains 1000000 elements with only prime indices set to `True`, all other elements set to `False`, `i` is 1000000, the element at index i - 1 in list 'a' is True for the loop to execute. The code prints the count of True values in list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
