Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The given program correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to the input number 'n'. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes method to efficiently mark all the non-prime numbers up to 1,000,000. Then, for each input 'n', it counts the number of 'True' values in the boolean array 'a' up to index 'n', which indicates prime numbers. The program handles multiple datasets and prints the correct count for each input. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
