According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1,000,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 1,000,001.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where the values are updated based on the prime number pattern; the value of `n` will remain between 1 and 999,999; `i` is 1,000,001 for the next iteration**
