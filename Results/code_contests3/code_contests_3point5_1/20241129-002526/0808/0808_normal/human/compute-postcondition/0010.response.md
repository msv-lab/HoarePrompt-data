Postcondition: ***n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True. After the if statement, a will be a list of 1,000,000 elements where the values will be updated based on a specific pattern related to prime numbers. The value of n will remain between 1 and 999,999, and i will be 2 for the next iteration.***
