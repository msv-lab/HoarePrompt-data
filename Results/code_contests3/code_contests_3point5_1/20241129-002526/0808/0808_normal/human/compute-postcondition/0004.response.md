Example Answer:
The value of `a` at index `j` is set to False. Since `j` is equal to `i` and `i` is 2, the value at index 2 in list `a` is set to False. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the value at index 2 set to False, i is 2, j is equal to i.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the value at index 2 set to False, i is 2, j is equal to i**
