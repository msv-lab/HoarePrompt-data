According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of 1000000. Before the loop starts, `n` is between 1 and 999,999, and `i` is 1,000,001 for the next iteration. So, for the loop to execute, `n` should remain between 1 and 999,999, and `i` should be less than or equal to the square root of 1000000. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True, `i` is 1,000,001 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute, `i` is less than or equal to the square root of 1000000**
