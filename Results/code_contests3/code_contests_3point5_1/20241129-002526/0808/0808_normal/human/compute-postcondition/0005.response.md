According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to 2. The next value of `j` is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is 2 ** 2 - 1 = 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1000000, thus the next value of `j` should be 3.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999; a is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the value at index 2 set to False, i is 2, j is equal to 3**
