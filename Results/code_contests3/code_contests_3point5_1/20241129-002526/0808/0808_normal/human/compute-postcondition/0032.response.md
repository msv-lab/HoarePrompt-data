According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is input coming from `sys.stdin`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, and `i` is 1,000,000. For the loop to execute one more time, there should be input available from `sys.stdin`.
State: **`n` is an integer in the range of 1 to 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 1,000,000, input from `sys.stdin` is available for the next iteration**
