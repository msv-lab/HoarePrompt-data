According to the code, the loop depends on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True except for index 1,000,001 which is set to False, `i` is 1,000,001, `j` is calculated based on the current state, and a[j] is set to False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next value of `j` based on the current state. Given that `j` is calculated based on the current state, we need to calculate the next value of `j` that satisfies the range condition in the for loop statement.

In this case, the next value of `j` should be such that it falls within the range `(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. This means the next value of `j` should be greater than or equal to `i ** 2 - 1` and less than `1000000`, while also being a multiple of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True except for index 1,000,001 which is set to False, `i` is 1,000,001, `j` is the next value that satisfies the range condition in the for loop statement, and a[j] is set to False**.
