Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program initializes a list of 1,000,000 elements with True values and then updates the list based on a prime number pattern.
- It reads input from sys.stdin, prints the count of True values in the list up to a given input value, and repeats this process until there is no more input.
- The code correctly identifies prime numbers and counts them as per the problem description.
- The code handles the input constraints of 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and the number of datasets being less than or equal to 30.
- Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
