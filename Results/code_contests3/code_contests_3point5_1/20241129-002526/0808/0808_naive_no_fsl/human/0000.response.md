Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer `n`. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to 1000000. The algorithm marks all multiples of a prime number as not prime, leaving only the prime numbers marked as True in the array `a`. The program then simply counts the number of True values in the array up to the given input `n` and prints the count, which corresponds to the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`.

Since the program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
