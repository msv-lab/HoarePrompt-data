Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully operate as described in the annotations. It does not actually read any input from `sys.stdin` due to the absence of proper handling for that. Therefore, it does not print the count of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` as required by the problem description. As a result, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is therefore incorrect.
