According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000000, `j` is updated based on the formula `j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the range specified.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, `a[0]` is False, `a[999999]` is True, `i` is 1000000, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range specified for the loop to execute one more time**
