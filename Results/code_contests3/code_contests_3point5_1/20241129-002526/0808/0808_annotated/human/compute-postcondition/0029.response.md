Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False. Specifically, `a[j]` is set to False for all appropriate values of `j`. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm has been applied to the list `a`, marking all non-prime numbers as False.**
