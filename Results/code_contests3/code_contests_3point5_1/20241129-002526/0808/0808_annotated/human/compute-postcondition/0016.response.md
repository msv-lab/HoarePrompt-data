According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1000000, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with the j-th element updated to False, `i` is 1000000. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than 1000000. 
State: **`n` is at least 1000000, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with the j-th element updated to False, `i` is 1000000, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than 1000000**
