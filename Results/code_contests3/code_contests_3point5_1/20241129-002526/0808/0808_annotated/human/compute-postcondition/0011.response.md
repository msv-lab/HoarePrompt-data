According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to 999,999. At the end of the last iteration, the loop index `i` is 999,999. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be 1000000.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False. If a[i - 1] is true and i > 1000, then all elements in a with indices that are multiples of i starting from (i^2 - 1) have been updated to False. For the loop to execute one more time, i should be 1000000**
