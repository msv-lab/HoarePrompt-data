Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False. If a[i - 1] is true and i > 1000, then all elements in a with indices that are multiples of i starting from (i^2 - 1) have been updated to False. For the loop to execute one more time, i should be 1000000. If a[i - 1] is true and n is at least 1000000, the loop does not execute.***
