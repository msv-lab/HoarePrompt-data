According to the code, the loop can execute again if the next value of `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1000. The next value of `j` is determined by `j = j + i`, and `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` must be less than 1000000.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, i is greater than 1000, for the loop to execute one more time the next value of j must be less than 1000000**
