Example Answer:
The j-th element of list `a` is updated to False. Since `j` is less than 1000000, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, after execution, the j-th element of list `a` will be False, and all other elements will remain True. The values of `n`, `i`, and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1000000, `a` is a list of 999999 True values and 1 False value, `i` is 1000000, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is less than 1000000**
