Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False (specifically, `a[j]` is set to False for all appropriate values of `j`), `a[0]` is False, `a[999999]` is True, `i` is 1000000, `j` is adjusted to the next value in the range specified for the loop to execute one more time.***
