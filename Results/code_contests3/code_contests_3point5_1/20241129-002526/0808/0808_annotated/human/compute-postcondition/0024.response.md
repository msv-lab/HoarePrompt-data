The value of `a` list is updated such that `a[j]` is set to False. Here, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the range `(1000000, 0)`. Since `j` is initially 1000000, the next value in the range after 1000000 would be 0. Therefore, `a[0]` will be set to False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, `a[0]` is False, `a[999999]` is True, `i` is 1000000, `j` is 0**
