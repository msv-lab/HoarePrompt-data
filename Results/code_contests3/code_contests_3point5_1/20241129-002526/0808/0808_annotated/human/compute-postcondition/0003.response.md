According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if the range specified by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)` is not empty. For this range to be non-empty, the starting value `i ** 2 - 1` must be less than 1000000. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` must be such that `i ** 2 - 1 < 1000000`, which implies `i` should be less than or equal to 1000. 

Additionally, the loop will only execute if the (i-1)th element of list `a` is a True value. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the (i-1)th element of list `a` must be True.

State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 True values, for the loop to execute the first time i is 2, (i-1)th element of a is True, and i is less than or equal to 1000**
