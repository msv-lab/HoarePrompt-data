According to the code, the loop will execute again if the value of `j` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1000000, `j` is equal to or greater than 1000000. Since the loop is iterating over `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing by `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the specified range.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, `a[999999]` is true, `i` is 1000000, `j` needs to be updated to the next value within the range `(1000000 ** 2 - 1, 1000000, 1000000)` for the loop to execute one more time**
