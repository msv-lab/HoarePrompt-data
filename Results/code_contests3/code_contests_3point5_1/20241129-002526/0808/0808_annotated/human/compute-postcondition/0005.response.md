According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, `i` is greater than 1000. For the next iteration, `j` is increased by `i`, so the next value of `j` will be `i ** 2 - 1 + i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` must be less than 1000000.
State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, a is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, i is greater than 1000, for the loop to execute one more time the next value of j must be less than 1000000**
