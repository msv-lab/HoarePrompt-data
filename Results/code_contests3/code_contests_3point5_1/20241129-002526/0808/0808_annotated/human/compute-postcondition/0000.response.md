Example Answer: 
The list `a` is initialized with 1000000 `True` values. The variable `n` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 True values.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999; a is a list of 1000000 True values**
