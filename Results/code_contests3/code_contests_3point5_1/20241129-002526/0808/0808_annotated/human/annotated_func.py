#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999.**
def func():
    a = [True] * 1000000
    for i in range(2, 1000000):
        if a[i - 1]:
            for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
                a[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False. Specifically, `a[j]` is set to False for all appropriate values of `j`. The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm has been applied to the list `a`, marking all non-prime numbers as False.
    for s in sys.stdin:
        print(a[1:int(s)].count(True))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 999,999, `a` is a list of 1000000 True values with some elements updated to False, the loop does not execute, no input available from `sys.stdin`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` initializes a list of 1000000 elements with True values and applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers as False. It then attempts to read input from `sys.stdin` and prints the count of True values in the list `a` up to the specified index. However, there is a missing functionality in the code as it does not actually read any input from `sys.stdin` due to the absence of proper handling for that. Therefore, the function does not fully operate as described in the annotations.
