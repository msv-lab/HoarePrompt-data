Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly set the levels to the passages as required by the problem description. It generates levels based on the binary representation of the loop index, which does not guarantee that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even. 

For example, when N = 3, the program outputs:
```
1
1
2
```
This does not satisfy the condition that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to a room.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
