According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is not equal to 0. Right before the loop, `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be adjusted such that it is not equal to 0.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `n` is not equal to 0**
