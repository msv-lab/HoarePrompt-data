Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. The value of `j` is between 1 and 499, so `j + 1` is between 2 and 500. The binary representation of `j + 1` will have at least one set bit. The code finds the position of the rightmost set bit (1-indexed) by reversing the binary representation, finding the index of the first '1', and adding 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is between 1 and 499, and the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is between 1 and 499, position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated**
