Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1 each time the code is executed. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is not equal to 0 for the loop to run the first time, the loop will run until `n` becomes 0. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), where `n` can be 1 to 499 after executing the code multiple times.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), where `n` can be 1 to 499 after executing the code multiple times**
