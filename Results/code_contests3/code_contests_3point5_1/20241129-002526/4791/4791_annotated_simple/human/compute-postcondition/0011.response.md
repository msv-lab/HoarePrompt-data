Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1, so the value of `n` changes based on its previous value. As `n` is between 2 and 500, after decrementing by 1, `n` will be between 1 and 499. The value of `j` which is `n-1` will also change accordingly. Since the loop needs to execute the last time when `n` is between 1 and 499 inclusive, and the output value is 1, the loop will not execute one more time. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is between 1 and 499 inclusive, and the output value is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is `n-1`, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is between 1 and 499 inclusive, and the output value is 1**
