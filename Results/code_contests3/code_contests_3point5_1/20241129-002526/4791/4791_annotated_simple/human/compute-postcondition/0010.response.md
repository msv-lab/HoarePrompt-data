According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is considered truthy, meaning any non-zero value. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is `n-1`, and for the loop to execute the last time `n` is between 1 and 499 inclusive, and the output value is 1. Since the loop will execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, j is n-1, for the loop to execute the last time n is between 1 and 499 inclusive, and the output value is 1, for the loop to execute one more time n is greater than 1**
