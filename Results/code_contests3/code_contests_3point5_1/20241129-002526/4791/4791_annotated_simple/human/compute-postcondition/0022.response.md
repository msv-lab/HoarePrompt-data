Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is 0, `j + 1` is 1. Therefore, the binary representation of 1 is '1'. The rightmost set bit is at position 0 (from the right), so the code returns 1. 
Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 499, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is 500, and the output value is 1, the loop must execute at least once, so `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 0. The code returns 1.**
