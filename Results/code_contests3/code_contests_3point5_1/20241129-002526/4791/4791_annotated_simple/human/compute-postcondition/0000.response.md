Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` can be any integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is the input integer.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is the input integer**
