According to the code, the loop will execute `n` number of times, where `n` is the range specified in the loop. Since after all iterations of the loop, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, and `j` is 499, it means that the loop will execute at least once. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 499, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is 500, and the output value is 1, the loop must execute at least once, so `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 0**
