According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is between 1 and 499 inclusive and `j` is 0.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is between 1 and 499 inclusive**
