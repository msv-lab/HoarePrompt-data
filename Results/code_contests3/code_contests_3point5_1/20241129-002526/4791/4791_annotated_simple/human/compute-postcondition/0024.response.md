Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 498, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is 500, and the output value is 1. The code prints the position of the rightmost '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, starting from 1. In this case, `j + 1` is 499, which in binary is '111110011'. The rightmost '1' bit is at position 1, so the code outputs 1.**
