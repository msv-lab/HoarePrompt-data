Example Answer:
`j + 1` is calculated first, which results in 3. Then, `bin(3)` converts 3 to binary which is '0b11'. Reversing the binary string gives '11'. Finding the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string gives 0. Adding 1 to the index gives 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, j is 2, for the loop to execute a second time n is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and the output value is 1.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, j is 2, for the loop to execute a second time n is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and the output value is 1**
