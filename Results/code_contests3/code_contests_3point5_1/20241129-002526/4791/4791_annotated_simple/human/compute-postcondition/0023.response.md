According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 1 and 499, `j` is 499, `n` is 500, and the output value is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, so `j` must be adjusted to 498.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 498, for the loop to execute the last time `n` is 500, and the output value is 1**
