Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the logic required to set levels to the passages as described in the problem description. The program simply decreases the value of `n` in a while loop and then prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j+1`. This logic does not address the problem requirements of setting levels to passages in such a way that the number of times we pass through a passage is always even when leaving and returning to a room.

The program should calculate and print out the levels of passages based on the problem description, but it does not do so. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
