#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 1 and 499, `n` is 0, `j` is 499
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input value `n`, decrements it in a loop, and then iterates through a range of numbers to print the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in their binary representation. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates based on the input `n`. However, the code snippet does not accurately match the annotations as there is a missing return statement or explicit output. Additionally, the code snippet may not behave as expected due to the decrementing of a string input `n` in the while loop, which could potentially lead to a TypeError. Further clarification and correction are needed in the code to align it with the annotations provided.
