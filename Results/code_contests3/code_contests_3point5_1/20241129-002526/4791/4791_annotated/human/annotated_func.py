#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `j` is -1, the loop does not execute
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an input `n`, decrements `n` in a loop without ever entering the loop, and then attempts to iterate through a range based on `n` which will not execute. The code does not perform any meaningful computation or task and does not return any value. The annotations suggest a loop and printing binary values, but the code does not execute this logic.
