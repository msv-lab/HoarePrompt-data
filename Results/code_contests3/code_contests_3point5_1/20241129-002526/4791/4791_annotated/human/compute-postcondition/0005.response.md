According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the output of the expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` is displayed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and be less than `n`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the output of the expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` is displayed, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `n`**
