Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is decreased by 1. Since `n` is a user input, the value could be any integer between 2 and 500. After decrementing by 1, `n` will be one less than the user input value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is one less than the user input.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is one less than the user input**
