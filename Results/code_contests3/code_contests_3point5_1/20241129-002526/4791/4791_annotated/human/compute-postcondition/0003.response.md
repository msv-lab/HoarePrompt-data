According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` is one less than the user input, it means the user input must be at least 1. Therefore, `N` should be adjusted to be between 1 and 500 (inclusive) for the loop to execute.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) for the loop to execute**
