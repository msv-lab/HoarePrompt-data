According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the output of the expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` is displayed, and `j` is less than `n`. As the loop increases `j` by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n+1`.
State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), the output of the expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` is displayed, `j` is less than `n+1` for the loop to execute one more time**
