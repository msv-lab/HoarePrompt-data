Example Answer:
The expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` is executed, where `j` is the initial value. The value of `j` is initially `n - 1`. The expression finds the position of the rightmost '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, adds 1 to it, and prints the result. The loop will continue as long as the output is not equal to 1, and `n` is decreased by 1 each time. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will continue with updated values of `n`, and the previous output value is displayed.
Output State: **The loop will continue with updated values of `n`, and the previous output value is displayed.**
