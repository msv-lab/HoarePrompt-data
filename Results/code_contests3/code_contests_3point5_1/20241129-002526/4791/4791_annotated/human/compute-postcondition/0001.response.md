According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a truthy value (i.e., not 0). Right before the loop, `n` is a user input and is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Since any non-zero integer will allow the loop to execute, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a user input**
