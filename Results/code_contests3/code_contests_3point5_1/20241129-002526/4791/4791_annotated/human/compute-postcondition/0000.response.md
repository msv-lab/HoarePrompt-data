Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` is not specified within the given initial state. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a user input.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a user input**
