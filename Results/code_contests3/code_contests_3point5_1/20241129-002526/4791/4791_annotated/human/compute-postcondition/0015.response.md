Example Answer:
The code prints the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j + 1 after reversing it. The value of j is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact result. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop will continue with updated values of n, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than the updated n value.
Output State: **The loop will continue with updated values of n, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than the updated n value**
