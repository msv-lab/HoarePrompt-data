Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1. The value of j is used in the calculation. 
Output State: **The loop will continue with updated values of n, for the loop to execute one more time j must be less than the updated n value, position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of j+1**
