Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`, then adds 1 to get the position of that set bit starting from 1. Since `j` is 0, `j + 1` is 1, and the binary representation of 1 is '0b1'. The rightmost set bit is at position 1, so the output will be 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, the output is 1**.
