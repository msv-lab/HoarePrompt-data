According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute if `n` is 0. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **For the loop to execute again, `n` needs to be greater than 0**
