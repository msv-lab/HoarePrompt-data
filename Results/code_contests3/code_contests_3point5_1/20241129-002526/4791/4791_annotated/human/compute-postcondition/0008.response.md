Example Answer:
The expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` is executed, where `j` is less than `n+1`. The output of this expression is the index of the first occurrence of '1' when the binary representation of `j + 1` is reversed. This index is then incremented by 1. The result of this expression is displayed as output. 
Output State: **The output of the expression is displayed as the final output.**
