According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will continue with updated values of `n`. 
State: **The loop will continue with updated values of `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than the updated `n` value**
