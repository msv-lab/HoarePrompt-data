The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it operates on a predefined integer `N` which is between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The function does not return a single value but performs a specific task or computation based on the value of `N`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to execute a task or computation based on the predefined integer `N` within the specified constraints.
