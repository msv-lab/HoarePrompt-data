According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Since `n` is decremented by 1 before the loop starts, the adjustment needed for the loop to execute is `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
