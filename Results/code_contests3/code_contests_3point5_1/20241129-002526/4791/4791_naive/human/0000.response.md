Correctness: **False**

The given program does not accurately set the levels of the passages as required by the problem description. The logic used in the program is not in line with the constraints and conditions provided in the problem statement. 

One potential case where the program fails is when N = 4. The correct output should be:
```
1 1 1
1 1
1
```
However, the program does not produce the correct output for this case. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
