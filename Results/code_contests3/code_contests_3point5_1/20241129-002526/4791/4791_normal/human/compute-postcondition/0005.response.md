According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499. To calculate the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of j + 1, the next iteration needs to have j increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, n remains the same and j is increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of j + 2 is calculated and printed**
