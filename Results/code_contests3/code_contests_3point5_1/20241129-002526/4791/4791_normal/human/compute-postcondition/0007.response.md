According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499. To determine the next iteration, we need to analyze the binary representation of j + 2 and find the position of the rightmost set bit (1). This means we need to consider the binary representation of (j + 2) for the next iteration.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of (j + 2) needs to be calculated and printed for the next iteration**
