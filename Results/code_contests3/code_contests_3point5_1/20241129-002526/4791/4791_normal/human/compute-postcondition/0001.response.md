According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is not empty or evaluates to True. Since `n` is a string containing the input value, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must not be an empty string. 
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500; for the loop to execute the first time `n` must not be an empty string**
