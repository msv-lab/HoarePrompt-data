Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input. The variable `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, so after execution, `n` will be a string containing the input value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a string containing the input value.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a string containing the input value**
