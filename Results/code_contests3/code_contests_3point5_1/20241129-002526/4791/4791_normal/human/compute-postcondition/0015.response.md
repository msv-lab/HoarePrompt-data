Example Answer:
The code calculates and prints the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`. Since `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 until `n-1`, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` will be calculated and printed for each `j`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated and printed for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`**
