Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of (j + 2) and prints it. The value of j is not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the specific position. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of (j + 2) needs to be calculated and printed for the next iteration.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of (j + 2) needs to be calculated and printed for the next iteration**
