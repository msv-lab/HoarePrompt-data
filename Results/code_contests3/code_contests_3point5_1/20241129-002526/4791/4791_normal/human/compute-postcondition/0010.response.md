According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is not 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499. To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the value of `n` to be less than the current value while maintaining the rightmost set bit (1) position unchanged. 

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of n is calculated and printed for each value of j from 1 to n, n is less than the current value while maintaining the position of the rightmost set bit (1) unchanged**.
