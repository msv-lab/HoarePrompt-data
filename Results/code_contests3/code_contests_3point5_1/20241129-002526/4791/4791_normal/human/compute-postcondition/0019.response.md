According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `n` is non-zero. The state at the end of the previous iteration is `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, and `j` is `n-1`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be a non-zero integer less than the current value of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499 and for the loop to execute again `n` needs to be a non-zero integer less than the current value of `n`, `j` is `n-1`**
