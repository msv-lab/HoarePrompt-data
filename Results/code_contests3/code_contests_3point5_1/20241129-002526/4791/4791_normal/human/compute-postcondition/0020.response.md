Example Answer:
`n` is decremented by 1, which means its value will be decreased by 1. Since `n` needs to be a non-zero integer less than the current value of `n`, `n` will be a non-zero integer between 1 and 498 after execution. The value of `j` is `n-1`, so `j` will be one less than the new value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is `n-1`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is `n-1`**
