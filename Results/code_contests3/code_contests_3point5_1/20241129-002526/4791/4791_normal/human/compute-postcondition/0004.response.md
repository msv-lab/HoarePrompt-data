Example Answer:
The code calculates the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of j + 1. The value of j is not given, but since n is between 1 and 499 and the loop will execute, j + 1 will fall within the valid range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of j + 1 is calculated and printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of j + 1 is calculated and printed**
