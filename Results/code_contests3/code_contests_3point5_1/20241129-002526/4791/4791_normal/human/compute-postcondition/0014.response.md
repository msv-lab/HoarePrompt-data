According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 0. The position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` is calculated and printed for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` is calculated and printed for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`**
