According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is 0. Since the loop is designed to run as long as `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration would be:
State: **`n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is 1, the output of the code snippet is 1**
