According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, and it should still be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute another time `j` must be less than `n`**
