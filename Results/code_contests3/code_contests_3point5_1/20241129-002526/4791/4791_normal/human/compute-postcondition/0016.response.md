According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `n` and `j`. The loop executes for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `j` should be within the range from 1 to `n-1` inclusive.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 2, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `j + 1` is calculated and printed for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`**
