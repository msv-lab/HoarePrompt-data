According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. The position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` is crucial for the loop to execute correctly. Before the loop starts, `n` being between 1 and 499 ensures that the loop can execute. Additionally, for the loop to execute for the first time, `j` needs to be 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is 0, the position of the rightmost set bit (1) in the binary representation of `n` is calculated and printed for each value of `j` from 1 to `n-1`**
