According to the code, the loop will always execute as long as `n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498. However, the initial value of `j` is set to `n-1`, which means for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be 0. 
State: **`n` is a non-zero integer between 1 and 498, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
