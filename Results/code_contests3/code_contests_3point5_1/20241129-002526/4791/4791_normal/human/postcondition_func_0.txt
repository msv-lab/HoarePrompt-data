The function `func` reads an integer input `n`, then decrements `n` in a loop and for each value of `n`, it iterates over the range of `n` printing the position of the rightmost set bit (1-indexed) in the binary representation of each number from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value. The code does not actually restrict `n` to be between 2 and 500 as stated in the annotations.
