Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code incorrectly calculates the level of the passage connecting Room i and Room j by finding the position of the rightmost set bit (1-indexed) in the binary representation of each number from 1 to n. This approach does not ensure that the number of times a passage is passed through is always even when leaving and returning to the same room. 

For example, for n=3, the code will output:
```
1
1 2
```
This output does not satisfy the condition that the number of times a passage is passed through must be even when leaving and returning to the same room. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
