Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes an integer `N` as input, followed by a string `S`. It then shifts each character of `S` by `N` in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles all uppercase English letters and shifts them according to the given constraints.

For all potential cases where `N` is between 0 and 26, and the length of `S` is between 1 and 10^4, the program works as expected. The program calculates the new index correctly by considering the modulo operation `% 26` to ensure that the shifted character remains within the range of uppercase English letters. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the code logic, the correctness of the program is considered True for all potential cases.
