Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, and `n` is the input integer. Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of the index of `s` and the input integer `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing characters from `letters`, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is assigned the character in the 'letters' string at the index 'new_index'.**
