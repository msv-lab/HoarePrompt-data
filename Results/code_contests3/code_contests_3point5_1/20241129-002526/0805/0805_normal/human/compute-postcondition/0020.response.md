Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character in the `letters` string at index `new_index`, where `new_index` is the remainder of the sum of `index` and `n` divided by 26. The values of `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `s`, `index` are not affected directly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains characters from `letters` based on calculations, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at index `new_index` for the next character in the input string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains characters from `letters` based on calculations, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at index `new_index` for the next character in the input string**
