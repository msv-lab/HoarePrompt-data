Example Answer:
The value of `new_index` is calculated as the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26. `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. The variables have the following values: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing characters from `letters`, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`. After calculation, `new_index` will have a value between 0 and 25. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing characters from `letters`, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is a string containing characters from `letters`, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26**
