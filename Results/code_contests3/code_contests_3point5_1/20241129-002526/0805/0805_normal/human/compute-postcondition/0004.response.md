According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the input string `strings`. Before the loop starts, you need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is not empty and `s` is the first character in the input string**
