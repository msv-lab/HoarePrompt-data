Example Answer:
`new_strings` is appended with the value of `new_s`. The value of `new_s` is calculated based on the input string, `n`, and the characters in `letters`. The previous values of `new_strings`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are taken into account for this calculation. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains characters from `letters` based on calculations, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at index `new_index` for the next character in the input string, `new_strings` is updated with new character.**
