Example Answer:
The character `new_s` is appended to the `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is determined by calculating the new index based on the input integer `n` and the character `s`. The final `new_strings` will contain all the characters appended in each iteration. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` contains characters from `letters` based on calculations, `s` is the next character in the input string, `index` is the index of character `s` in the `letters` string, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is the character in the `letters` string at index `new_index`**
