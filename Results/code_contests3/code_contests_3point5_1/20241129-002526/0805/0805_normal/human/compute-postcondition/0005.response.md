Example Answer: 
The variable `index` is assigned the index of the character `s` in the string `letters`, which contains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. Since `s` is the first character in the input string, its index in `letters` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is not empty, `s` is the first character in the input string, `index` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `strings` is assigned the input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `strings` is not empty, `s` is the first character in the input string, `index` is 0**
