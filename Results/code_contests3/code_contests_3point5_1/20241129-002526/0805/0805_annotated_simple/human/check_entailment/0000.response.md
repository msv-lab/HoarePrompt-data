Correctness: **True**

The program correctly takes an integer `N` and a string `S` as input. It then shifts each character of the string `S` by `N` positions in alphabetical order. The program ensures that the shifting wraps around if it reaches the end of the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'Z' by 1 results in 'A'). The output is the resulting string after shifting each character.

The program follows the problem description and meets all the requirements specified.
