Example Answer:
`new_s` is added to the end of `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list. The initial state provides that `new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25, and `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list. Therefore, after execution, `new_strings` will have the letter at index `new_index` added to the end.
Output State: **`new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` has the letter at index `new_index` added to the end**
