Example Answer: 
`new_s` is assigned the value at index `new_index` in the list `letters`. The value of `new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26. Since the values are unknown, the exact value of `new_s` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26.
Output State: **`new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26**
