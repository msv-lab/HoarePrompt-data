Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, where `letters` is assumed to be a list of letters. The value of `new_index` is between 0 and 25, so `new_s` will be the letter at the index `new_index` in the list `letters`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list.
Output State: **`new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list**
