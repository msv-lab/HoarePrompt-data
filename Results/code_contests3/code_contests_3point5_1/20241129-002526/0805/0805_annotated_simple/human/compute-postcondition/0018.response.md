Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, where `index` is the index of `s` in the `letters` list and `n` is a value not defined in the initial state. The value of `added_index` depends on the initial state of `index` and the unknown value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` has the letter at index `new_index` added to the end, for the loop to execute one more time `strings` must have more elements than before, `index` is assigned the index of `s` in the `letters` list, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n, `new_index` is assigned the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26.
Output State: **`new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25, `new_s` is the letter at index `new_index` in the `letters` list, `new_strings` has the letter at index `new_index` added to the end, for the loop to execute one more time `strings` must have more elements than before, `index` is assigned the index of `s` in the `letters` list, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n, `new_index` is assigned the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26**
