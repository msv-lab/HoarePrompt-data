Example Answer: 
`new_strings` is appended with the value of `new_s`. The previous values of `new_strings` and `new_s` are unknown, so the resulting value of `new_strings` depends on the value of `new_s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26, `new_strings` is updated with the value of `new_s`.
Output State: **`new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26, `new_strings` is updated with the value of `new_s`**
