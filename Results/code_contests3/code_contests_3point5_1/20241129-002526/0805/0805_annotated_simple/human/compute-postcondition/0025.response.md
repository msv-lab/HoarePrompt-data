Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `N` and a string `S` as input. It then shifts each letter in the `S` string by `N` positions in the alphabet (wrapping around if necessary) and prints the resulting string `new_strings`. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, there is a missing functionality in the annotations regarding error handling if `N` is not within the specified range or if `S` contains characters other than uppercase English letters.**
