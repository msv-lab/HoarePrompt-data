Example Answer:
new_index is assigned the value of added_index modulo 26. Since added_index is the sum of the index and N, and index ranges from 0 to 25, the value of new_index will be between 0 and 25. Therefore, the Output State is: new_index is an integer between 0 and 25.
Output State: **new_index is an integer between 0 and 25**
