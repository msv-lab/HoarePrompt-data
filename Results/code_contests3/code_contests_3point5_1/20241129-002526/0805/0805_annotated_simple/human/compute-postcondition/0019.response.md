Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the remainder of the sum of `index` and `n` divided by 26. The variables `index` and `n` are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The value of `added_index` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26.
Output State: **`new_index` is the remainder of the sum of unknown values divided by 26**
