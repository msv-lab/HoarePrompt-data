According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the strings. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. At the beginning of the loop, new_strings is an empty string. So for the loop to be executed, the string is not empty and s is the first character in the string S.
State: **N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, letters is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', new_strings is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time S is not empty, s is the first character in the string S**
