You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. Additionally, an integer N will be given.

Shift each character of S by N in alphabetical order (see below), and print the resulting string.

We assume that `A` follows `Z`. For example, shifting `A` by 2 results in `C` (`A` \to `B` \to `C`), and shifting `Y` by 3 results in `B` (`Y` \to `Z` \to `A` \to `B`).

Constraints

* 0 \leq N \leq 26
* 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^4
* S consists of uppercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the string resulting from shifting each character of S by N in alphabetical order.

Examples

Input

2
ABCXYZ


Output

CDEZAB


Input

0
ABCXYZ


Output

ABCXYZ


Input

13
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ


Output

NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4.**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    strings = input()
    letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    new_strings = ''
    for s in strings:
        index = letters.index(s)
        
        added_index = index + n
        
        new_index = added_index % 26
        
        new_s = letters[new_index]
        
        new_strings += new_s
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` contains all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` contains the concatenated characters from `new_s` after processing all strings in `S`, `strings` is empty, `s` is the last string processed, `index` is the index of the last occurrence of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of adding the last `index` and `N`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in `letters`.
    print(new_strings)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes user input for an integer `N` and a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters. It processes each character in `S` by shifting it by `N` positions in the English alphabet, wrapping around from 'Z' to 'A' if necessary. The function then prints the modified string `new_strings`. The function does not return any specific output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
