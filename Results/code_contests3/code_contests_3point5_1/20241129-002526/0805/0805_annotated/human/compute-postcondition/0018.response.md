Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `added_index` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` needs to be adjusted accordingly, `S` will be updated based on new calculations, `new_strings` will be updated with the new character, `s` will be the next string in `strings`, `index` will be updated based on the next `s`, `added_index` will be calculated based on the updated `index` and `N`, `new_index` will be calculated based on the updated `added_index`, `new_s` will be assigned the character at index `new_index` in `letters`.
Output State: **`N` needs to be adjusted accordingly, `S` will be updated based on new calculations, `new_strings` will be updated with the new character, `s` will be the next string in `strings`, `index` will be updated based on the next `s`, `added_index` will be calculated based on the updated `index` and `N`, `new_index` will be calculated based on the updated `added_index`, `new_s` will be assigned the character at index `new_index` in `letters`**
