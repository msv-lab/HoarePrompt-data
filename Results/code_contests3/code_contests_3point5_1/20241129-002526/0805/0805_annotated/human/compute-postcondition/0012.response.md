Example Answer:
`added_index` is assigned the value of `index` + `N`. The value of `N` can be between 0 and 26, and the initial state of `N` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` contains all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` contains the character at index `new_index`, `strings` is not empty and has more strings, `s` is the next string in the `strings` variable, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`, `new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 0 and 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` contains all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` contains the character at index `new_index`, `strings` is not empty and has more strings, `s` is the next string in the `strings` variable, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`, `new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25**
