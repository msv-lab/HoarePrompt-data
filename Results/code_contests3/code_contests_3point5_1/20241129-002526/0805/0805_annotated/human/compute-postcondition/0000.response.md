Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, so after execution, `n` will have a value between 0 and 26. The variable `S` is not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4**
