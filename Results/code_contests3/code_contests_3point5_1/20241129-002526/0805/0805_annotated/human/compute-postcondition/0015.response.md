Example Answer:
`new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in `letters`. The value of `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26. The value of `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`. Therefore, `new_strings` is concatenated with `new_s`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 0 and 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `letters` contains all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` contains the concatenated characters from `new_s`, `strings` is not empty and has more strings, `s` is the next string in the `strings` variable, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`, `new_index` is the remainder of `added_index` divided by 26, `new_s` is assigned the character at index `new_index` in `letters`.**
