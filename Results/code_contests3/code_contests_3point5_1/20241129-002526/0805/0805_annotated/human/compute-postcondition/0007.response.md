Example Answer:
`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`. The value of `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `s` in `letters`, and `N` is an integer between 0 and 26. Therefore, after calculation, `new_index` will be in the range of 0 to 25. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 0 and 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 10^4, `letters` is a string containing all uppercase English letters, `new_strings` is an empty string, `strings` is not empty, `s` is the first string in the `strings` variable, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of adding `index` and `N`, `new_index` is an integer between 0 and 25**
