Functionality: **The function `func` takes user input for an integer `N` and a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters. It processes each character in `S` by shifting it by `N` positions in the English alphabet, wrapping around from 'Z' to 'A' if necessary. The function then prints the modified string `new_strings`. The function does not return any specific output.**
