Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer N as input, followed by a string S. It then shifts each character of the string S by N in alphabetical order and prints the resulting string. The program correctly handles the shifting logic by calculating the new index based on the given integer N and the alphabetical order of letters. The program also correctly loops through each character in the input string and generates the new shifted string accordingly. The constraints provided in the problem description are also satisfied by the program. Overall, the program works as expected for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
