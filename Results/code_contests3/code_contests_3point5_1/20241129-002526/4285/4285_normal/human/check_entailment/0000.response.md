Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem description. The function `func_1` attempts to check if a string `n` is a palindrome by extracting alphabetic characters, converting them to lowercase, and then checking if the resulting string is a palindrome. However, the problem description asks for the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, which is not what the code is doing. The code is checking for palindromes in a string, not generating the n-th even-length palindrome number.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect solution.
