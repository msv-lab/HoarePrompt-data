The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. It then creates a new string `x` by converting `n` to lowercase letters and removing any non-alphabetic characters. Finally, the function returns True if the string `x` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and False otherwise.
