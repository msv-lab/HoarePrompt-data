Example Answer:
The code iterates over each character in `n`, converts it to lowercase if it is an alphabet, and then joins all the characters together. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, it does not contain any alphabets. Therefore, the output of the code will be an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an empty string**
