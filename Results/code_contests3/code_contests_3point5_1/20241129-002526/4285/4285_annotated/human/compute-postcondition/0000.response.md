Example Answer:
The code iterates through each character in the string representation of the integer `n`, converts each character to lowercase if it is an alphabet character, and then joins all those lowercase characters back together. Since `n` is a positive integer, the string representation of `n` does not contain any alphabet characters, so the resulting `x` will be an empty string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100000; `x` is an empty string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10100000; `x` is an empty string**
