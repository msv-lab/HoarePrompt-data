The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n, extracts all alphabetic characters in lowercase from n, creates a string x from these characters, and then checks if x is a palindrome. If x is a palindrome, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where n is not a string, or when there are no alphabetic characters present in n.
