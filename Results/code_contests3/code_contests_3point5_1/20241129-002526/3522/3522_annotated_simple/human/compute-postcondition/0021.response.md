Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, `a` is updated by subtracting 9 and `c` is set to 1. Then, the expression `print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c` is evaluated. If `a` is in the specified values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`.

Output State: **`a` is updated based on the condition, and the result of the expression is printed.**
