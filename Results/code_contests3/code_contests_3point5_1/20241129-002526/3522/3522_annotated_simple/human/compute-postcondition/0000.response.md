According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value returned by the `input()` function. If the value returned is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that the value returned by `input()` is greater than 0. 
State: **for the loop to execute the first time, the value returned by `input()` is greater than 0**
