Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by subtracting 9 from its current value. The previous value of `a` is unknown, but after the subtraction, `a` will be 9 less than its original value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned the new value after subtracting 9, `c` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the new value after subtracting 9, `c` is 0**
