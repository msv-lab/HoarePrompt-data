According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` might be updated based on the condition, `c` is either 0 or 1, the printed value is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the input value must be greater than 0.
State: **`a` is either updated based on the condition, `c` is either 0 or 1, the printed value is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`, for the loop to execute one more time input value must be greater than 0**.
