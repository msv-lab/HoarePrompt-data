According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value. If the input value is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has a value greater than 0 and `c` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition. For the loop to execute one more time, the input value should be greater than 0.
State: **`a` has a value greater than 0, `c` is an integer that is either 0 or 1. If `a` is an odd number, `c` is 1. Otherwise, `c` remains 0, for the loop to execute one more time input value must be greater than 0**
