Example Answer:
If the input value of `a` is odd, then `a` will be updated to the initial value of `a` minus 9, and `c` will be set to 1. If `a` is even, no changes will be made to `a` and `c`. 
After that, the code will print -1 if the new value of `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise, it will print the result of `a / 4 + c`.

Output State: **`a` is either updated based on the condition, `c` is either 0 or 1, the printed value is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`**
