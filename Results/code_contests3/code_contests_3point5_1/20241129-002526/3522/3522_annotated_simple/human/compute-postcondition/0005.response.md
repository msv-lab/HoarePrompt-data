Example Answer: 
`c` is assigned the value 1. Since `c` is being directly assigned the value 1, the previous value of `c` being 0 is overwritten. The value of `a` being an odd number is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an odd number, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is an odd number, `c` is 1**
