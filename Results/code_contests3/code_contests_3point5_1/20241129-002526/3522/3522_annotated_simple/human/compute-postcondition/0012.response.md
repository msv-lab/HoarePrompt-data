Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` is 1. The initial state mentions that `a` is the result of the initial value of `a` minus 9, but the exact initial value of `a` is not given, so it cannot be calculated or affected by the provided code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the result of the initial value of `a` minus 9, `c` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is the result of the initial value of `a` minus 9, `c` is 1**
