Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly handles each query by checking if the input number is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and if it's not, it calculates the maximum possible number of summands by dividing the number by 4 and adding 1 if necessary. This aligns with the problem description where it states that if a number is less than any composite number, it does not have valid splittings, and if it can be represented as a sum of composite numbers, it should print the maximum possible number of summands. The program follows these rules for all potential cases.
