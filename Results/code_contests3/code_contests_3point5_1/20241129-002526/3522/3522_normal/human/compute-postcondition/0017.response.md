Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. This means that `c` is now 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Each query integer n is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, for the loop to execute _ is less than input(); a is the new input value entered, c is 0 if a is odd.
Output State: **Each query integer n is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, for the loop to execute _ is less than input(); a is the new input value entered, c is 0 if a is odd**
