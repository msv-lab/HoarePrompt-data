Output State: Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is equal to the total number of iterations of the loop, `a` is the last input value entered, `c` is 1 if the last `a` is odd. The code prints -1 if the last `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints the result of the last `a` divided by 4 plus the sum of all `c` values encountered during the loop execution.
