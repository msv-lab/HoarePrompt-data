According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input value `a`. If `_` is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, `a` is the input value entered, `c` is 1. If `a % 2` is not equal to 0, then the program enters the if condition. After the code snippet `a = a - 9`, the value of `a` is decreased by 9. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the new state should be adjusted accordingly:
State: **Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the input value entered - 9, `c` is 1**
