Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `a - 9`, which means 9 is subtracted from the current value of `a`. The value of `c` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the new input value entered, `c` is 0 if `a` is odd.
Output State: **Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the new input value entered, `c` is 0 if `a` is odd.**
