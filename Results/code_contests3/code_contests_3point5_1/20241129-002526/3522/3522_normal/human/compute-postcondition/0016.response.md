Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. Since no other variables are affected directly, the output state is `Each query integer n is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, for the loop to execute _ is less than input(); a is the new input value entered, c is 1 if a is odd.
Output State: **Each query integer n is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 2, for the loop to execute _ is less than input(); a is the new input value entered, c is 1 if a is odd**
