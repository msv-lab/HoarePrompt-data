Output State: Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the new input value entered, `c` is 1 if `a` is odd. The code prints -1 if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it prints `a` divided by 4 plus `c`.
