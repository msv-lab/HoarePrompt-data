Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the input value entered, `c` is 0.
Output State: **Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the input value entered, `c` is 0**
