Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It iterates over a sequence of queries, where each query integer `a` is a positive integer greater than 1. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 and increments the count `c` by 1. It then prints -1 if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, otherwise it prints the result of `a` divided by 4 plus the sum of all `c` values encountered during the loop execution.**
