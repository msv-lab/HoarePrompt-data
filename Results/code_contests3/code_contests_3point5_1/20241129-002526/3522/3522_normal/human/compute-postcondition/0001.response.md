Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The loop will execute based on the condition `_` is less than input(), and `_` is initially 0. Therefore, the output state is: Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the input value entered.
Output State: **Each query integer `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input(); `a` is the input value entered**
