According to the code, the loop will execute `input()` number of times. To ensure the loop executes, each query integer `ni` should be a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to `Each query integer ni is a positive integer greater than 1` and `_` is 0.
State: **Each query integer ni is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 0, for the loop to execute `_` is less than input()**
