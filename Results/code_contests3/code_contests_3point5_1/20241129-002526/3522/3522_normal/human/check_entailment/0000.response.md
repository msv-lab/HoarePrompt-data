Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It handles the queries as described, subtracts 9 from odd numbers, increments the count `c` accordingly, and prints the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands. The code also correctly prints -1 if there are no such splittings for the given query integer `a`. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and accurately describe the functionality of the program. Therefore, the code is correct.
