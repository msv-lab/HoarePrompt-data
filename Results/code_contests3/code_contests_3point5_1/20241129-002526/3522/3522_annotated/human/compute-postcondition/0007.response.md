Example Answer:
If `a` is an odd integer, `c` is updated to 1. If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `(a / 4) + c` is printed. Therefore, the output state is: `c` is updated based on `a` being odd or even, and the result of the expression is printed.
Output State: **`c` is updated based on `a` being odd or even, and the result of the expression is printed**
