Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The loop will execute as long as the input is greater than 0. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified to: Each query integer `a` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time input is greater than 0.
Output State: **Each query integer `a` is a positive integer greater than 1, for the loop to execute the first time input is greater than 0**
