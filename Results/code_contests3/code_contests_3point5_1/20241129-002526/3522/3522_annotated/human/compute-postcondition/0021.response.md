Example Answer: 
If `a` is odd, then `c` is updated to 1 otherwise `c` remains 0. 
If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), then -1 is printed. 
Otherwise, the result of the expression `a / 4 + c` is printed. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `c` are integers, and the result is either -1 or the value of the expression `a / 4 + c`.
Output State: **`a`, `c` are integers, output is either -1 or the result of the expression `a / 4 + c`**
