Example Answer:
The value of `a` is decreased by 9. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `a`, but it is mentioned that the remainder of `a` divided by 2 is not 0. After subtracting 9 from `a`, the remainder of `a` divided by 2 may or may not be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is 0, `a` is an integer where the remainder of `a` divided by 2 may or may not be 0.
Output State: **`c` is 0, `a` is an integer where the remainder of `a` divided by 2 may or may not be 0**
