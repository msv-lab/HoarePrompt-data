Example Answer:
If `a` is odd, `c` is set to 1 and `a` is decreased by 9. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0. Then, based on the value of `a`, either -1 is printed or `a / 4 + c` is printed. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is either 0 or 1, `a` is decreased by 9 if odd, `a` and `c` remain the same if even.
Output State: **`c` is either 0 or 1, `a` is decreased by 9 if odd, `a` and `c` remain the same if even**
