Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input. The value of `a` will be determined by the user input, so it cannot be determined in advance. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` and `a` will need to be adjusted based on the previous iteration for the loop to execute another time.
Output State: **`c` and `a` will need to be adjusted based on the previous iteration for the loop to execute another time**
