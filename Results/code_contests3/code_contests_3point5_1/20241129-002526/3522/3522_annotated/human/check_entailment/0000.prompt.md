You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given several queries. In the i-th query you are given a single positive integer ni. You are to represent ni as a sum of maximum possible number of composite summands and print this maximum number, or print -1, if there are no such splittings.

An integer greater than 1 is composite, if it is not prime, i.e. if it has positive divisors not equal to 1 and the integer itself.

Input

The first line contains single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of queries.

q lines follow. The (i + 1)-th line contains single integer ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 109) — the i-th query.

Output

For each query print the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands, or -1, if there are no such splittings.

Examples

Input

1
12


Output

3


Input

2
6
8


Output

1
2


Input

3
1
2
3


Output

-1
-1
-1

Note

12 = 4 + 4 + 4 = 4 + 8 = 6 + 6 = 12, but the first splitting has the maximum possible number of summands.

8 = 4 + 4, 6 can't be split into several composite summands.

1, 2, 3 are less than any composite number, so they do not have valid splittings.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each query integer ni is a positive integer greater than 1.**
def func():
    for _ in xrange(input()):
        a = input()
        
        c = 0
        
        if a % 2 != 0:
            a = a - 9
            c = 1
        
        print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `c` are integers, output is either -1 or the result of the expression `a / 4 + c`
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func` iterates over a series of queries. For each query, it takes an input integer `a`, performs a calculation on `a` based on whether it is odd, and then prints either -1 or the result of the expression `a / 4 + c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. It handles odd numbers by subtracting 9 from them and setting `c` to 1. It then checks if `a` is in a specific set of values and prints -1 if it is, or the result of `a / 4 + c` otherwise.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
