Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over a series of queries, takes an input integer `a`, performs the necessary calculations based on whether `a` is odd, and then prints either -1 or the maximum possible number of summands in a valid splitting to composite summands. The program handles odd numbers by subtracting 9 from them and setting `c` to 1. It then checks if `a` is in a specific set of values and prints -1 if it is, or the result of `a / 4 + c` otherwise.

The program follows the problem description for every potential case and produces the correct output as required.
