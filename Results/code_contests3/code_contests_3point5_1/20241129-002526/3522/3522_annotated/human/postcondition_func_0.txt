Functionality: The function `func` iterates over a series of queries. For each query, it takes an input integer `a`, performs a calculation on `a` based on whether it is odd, and then prints either -1 or the result of the expression `a / 4 + c`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not explicitly return any value. It handles odd numbers by subtracting 9 from them and setting `c` to 1. It then checks if `a` is in a specific set of values and prints -1 if it is, or the result of `a / 4 + c` otherwise.
