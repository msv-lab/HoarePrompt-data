Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. It only considers certain prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) as values that cannot be split into composite summands. However, there are other non-prime numbers that also cannot be split into composite summands. For example, the number 6 cannot be split into composite summands but is not considered in the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all cases as mentioned in the problem description.
