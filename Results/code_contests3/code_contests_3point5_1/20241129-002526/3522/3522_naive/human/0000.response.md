Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the input number is odd and not a prime. 

For example, if the input number is 9, the program will reduce it to 0 by subtracting 9 from it and consider it as one summand. However, the correct answer should be 3 (9 = 3 + 3 + 3), as 9 is composite and can be represented as a sum of composite summands.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description.
