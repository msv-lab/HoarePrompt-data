The function `func` reads an integer `n` from user input, calculates the minimum number that consists of only '7' and '4' digits, has an equal count of '7' and '4', is greater than or equal to `n`, and has a length of at least 10 digits. This calculated number is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
