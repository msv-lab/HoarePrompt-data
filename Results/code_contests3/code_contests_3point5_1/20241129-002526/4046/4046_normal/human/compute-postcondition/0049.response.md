Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 3, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is less than `n`, no valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` was found in the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, and the conditions within the loop body must be met for the next iteration. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`***.
