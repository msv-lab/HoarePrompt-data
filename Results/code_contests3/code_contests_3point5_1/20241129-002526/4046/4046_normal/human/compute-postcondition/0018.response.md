According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `x`, `n`, `tem`, and the counts of '7' and '4' in the new `x`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 2, the count of '7' in the new `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the new `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the new list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the new list `x` is greater than or equal to `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1, and the counts of '7' and '4' in the new `x` need to remain equal. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 3, the count of '7' in the new `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the new `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the new list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the new list `x` is greater than or equal to `n`**.
