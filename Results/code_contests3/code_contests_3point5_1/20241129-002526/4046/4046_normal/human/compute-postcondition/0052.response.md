Example Answer:
The string `x` is converted to an integer and stored in `tem`. As the initial state of `x` is not provided, it is not possible to determine the exact value of `tem`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
