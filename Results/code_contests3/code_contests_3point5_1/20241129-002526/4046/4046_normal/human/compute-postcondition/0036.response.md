Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 3, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is less than `n`, `x` is the next element generated by the product of '74' with repeat i+1, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` if tem >= n.***
