Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then the program retains the initial state described in the precondition.**
