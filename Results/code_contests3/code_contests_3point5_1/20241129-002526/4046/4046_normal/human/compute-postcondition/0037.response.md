According to the code, the loop can execute again if the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is less than `n` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 3, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, and the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is less than `n`.  

To execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 4, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is less than `n`, `x` is the next element generated by the product of '74' with repeat i+1, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x` if tem >= n**.
