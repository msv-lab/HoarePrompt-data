According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the final list `x` satisfies the conditions specified. To adjust the state before the loop starts for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 3, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is less than `n`, no valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` was found in the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, and the conditions within the loop body must be met for the next iteration.**
