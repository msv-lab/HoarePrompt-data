Example Answer:
The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, so the `ans` will be updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is updated to the next value based on the range increment, count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
