Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 2, the count of '7' in the new `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the new `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the new list `x`, the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the new list `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the count of '7' in the new `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the new `x`, then the overall state of the program variables remains the same.***
