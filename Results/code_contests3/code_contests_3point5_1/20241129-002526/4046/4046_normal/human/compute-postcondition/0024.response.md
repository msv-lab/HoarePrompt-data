According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `l`, `n`, `ans`, `tem`, and the final list `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 1, the count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, and the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `i` is at least 3, the count of '7' in the final `x` is equal to the count of '4' in the final `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x`, and the integer value obtained by joining the elements of the final list `x` is greater than or equal to `n`**
