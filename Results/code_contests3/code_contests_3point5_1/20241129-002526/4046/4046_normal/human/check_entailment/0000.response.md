Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not consider the case when the input number `n` is already a super lucky number. For example, if `n = 4747`, the code should output `4747` as it is already a super lucky number and is greater than or equal to `n`. However, the code will not handle this scenario and will output a different number. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all cases mentioned in the problem description.
