Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It iterates over possible super lucky numbers starting from the length of the input number n, checks if the number has an equal count of 4s and 7s, and then finds the minimum super lucky number that is greater than or equal to n. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
