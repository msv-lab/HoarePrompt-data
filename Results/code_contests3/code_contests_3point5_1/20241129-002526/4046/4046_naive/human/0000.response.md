Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the least super lucky number that is not less than the given input number. It iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' digits of increasing length starting from the length of the input number until a super lucky number greater than or equal to the input number is found. The program then outputs the minimum super lucky number found. The program satisfies the problem description for all potential cases and works correctly for all inputs.
