Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an input integer n, calculates the length of the integer, ensures that the length is even, then iterates through all possible combinations of '4' and '7' of that length. It checks if the number formed has an equal count of '4' and '7', then finds the minimum number that satisfies the conditions and is greater than or equal to n. Finally, it prints the result which is the least super lucky number that is not less than n.

The program covers all possible cases and always outputs the correct result as required by the problem description.
