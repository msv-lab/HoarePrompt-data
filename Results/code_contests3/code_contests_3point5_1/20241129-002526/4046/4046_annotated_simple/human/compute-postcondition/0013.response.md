According to the code, for the loop to execute again, the variables `i`, `x`, and `tem` need to be adjusted. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` is the starting value of `l` and increments by 2 until reaching 10, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, the integer value of the concatenated string x is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string x. 

To adjust for the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 2.
- The counts of '7' and '4' in the new x should be equal.
- The integer value of the new x should be greater than or equal to `n`.
- `tem` should be updated to the integer value of the new x.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x, such that the conditions for x are satisfied**
