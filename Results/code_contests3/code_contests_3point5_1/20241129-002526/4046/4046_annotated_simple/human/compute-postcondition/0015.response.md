Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`. Since no specific values are given for `ans` and `tem`, the output state will depend on the comparison between these two variables. There are no changes to the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x, such that the conditions for x are satisfied.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x, such that the conditions for x are satisfied**
