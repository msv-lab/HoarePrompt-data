According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. The loop will execute if the range specified is valid. Before the loop starts, the key condition to adjust is that `l` should be an even number for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute `i` starts from l and increments by 2 until reaching 10**
