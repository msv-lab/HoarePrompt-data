Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. As `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned earlier, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of 4444477777 and the new calculated value of `tem`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l` and increments by 2 until reaching 10, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string x, and the integer value of the concatenated string x is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l` and increments by 2 until reaching 10, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string x, and the integer value of the concatenated string x is greater than or equal to `n`**
