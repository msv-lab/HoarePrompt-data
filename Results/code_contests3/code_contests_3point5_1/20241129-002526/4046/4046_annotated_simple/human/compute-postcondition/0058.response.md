Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number, and `i` is the next positive even integer for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is the next positive even integer after the current `i` for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is the next positive even integer after the current `i` for the loop to execute again**
