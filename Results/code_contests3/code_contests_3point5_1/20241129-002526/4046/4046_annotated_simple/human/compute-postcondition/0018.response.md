According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `tem`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+2`, and `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- The new concatenated string x should satisfy the condition that the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x.
- `tem` should be greater than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+3`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions.**
