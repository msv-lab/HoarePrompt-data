Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` starts from `l+8` and remains constant until reaching 10. The program state remains the same if the conditions for `tem` are not met.**
