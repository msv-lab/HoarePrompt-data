Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+3`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the program state remains the same without any changes.***
