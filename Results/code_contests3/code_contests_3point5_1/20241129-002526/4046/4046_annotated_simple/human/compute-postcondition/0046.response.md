Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x` after joining all elements in `x`. As no information about the contents of `x` is provided, the output state will reflect this uncertainty.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is the next positive even integer after the current `i` for the loop to execute, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`**
