According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. Since `i` starts at `l` and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches 10, we need to adjust the states accordingly.

At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` are in their respective states as mentioned. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next even integer after the current value.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is the next positive even integer after the current `i` for the loop to execute**
