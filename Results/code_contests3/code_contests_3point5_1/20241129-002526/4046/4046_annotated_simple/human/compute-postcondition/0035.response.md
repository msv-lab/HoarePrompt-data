Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function updates `ans` to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, and `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.***
