Example Answer: 
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans` after this operation. The loop will execute again by increasing the value of `i` by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
