According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `i`. If `i` is less than 10, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an even number, `i` starts from `l+8` and remains constant until reaching 10. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is incremented by 2 from the previous value**
