Example Answer:
The string `x` is concatenated and then converted to an integer, stored in the variable `tem`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+3`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+3`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions.**
