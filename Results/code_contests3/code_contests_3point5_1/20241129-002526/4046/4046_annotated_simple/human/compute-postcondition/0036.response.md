Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the function updates `ans` to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, and `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again.***
