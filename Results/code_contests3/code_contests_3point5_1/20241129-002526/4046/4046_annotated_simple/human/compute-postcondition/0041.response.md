Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated elements in list `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` and the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then the minimum value of `tem` is updated to `ans` and `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to continue.***
