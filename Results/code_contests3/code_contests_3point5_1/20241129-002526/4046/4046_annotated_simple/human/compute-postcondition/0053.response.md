Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned to `ans`. The variables `n`, `l`, `i`, `x`, and the condition for '7's and '4's in `x` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is the next positive even integer after the current `i` for the loop to execute again, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of `x` as a string.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is the next positive even integer after the current `i` for the loop to execute again, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of `x` as a string.**
