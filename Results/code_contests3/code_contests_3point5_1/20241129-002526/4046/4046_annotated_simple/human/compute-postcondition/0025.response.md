According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `i`. Since `i` is incremented by 2 from the previous value, the loop will execute as long as `i` is a positive integer. The loop uses the product function with the characters '74' and the repeat parameter being `i`, which generates all possible combinations of '74' with length `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute**
