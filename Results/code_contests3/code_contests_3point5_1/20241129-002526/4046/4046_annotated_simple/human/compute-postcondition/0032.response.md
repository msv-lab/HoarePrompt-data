According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute. 

To adjust the states for the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
- If the number of occurrences of '7' in the next `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x`, `tem` will be assigned accordingly.
- If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute and the overall state of the program variables will remain the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is increased by 1 for the loop to execute again**
