According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` starts from `l` and increments by 2 until reaching 10. Since `l` is an even number, it satisfies the condition for `i` to start from `l` and increment by 2. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` starts from `l` and increments by 2 until reaching 10**
