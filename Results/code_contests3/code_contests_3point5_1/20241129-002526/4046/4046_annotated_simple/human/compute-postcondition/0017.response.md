Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+2`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions. If the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program executes without any changes to the variables.***
