Example Answer:
`l` is assigned the length of the string representation of `n`, which is a positive integer. The value of `n` is between 1 and 10^9, so the length of its string representation can be between 1 and 10. `ans` is assigned the value 4444477777. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; l is the length of the string representation of n which is between 1 and 10; ans is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; l is the length of the string representation of n which is between 1 and 10; ans is 4444477777**
