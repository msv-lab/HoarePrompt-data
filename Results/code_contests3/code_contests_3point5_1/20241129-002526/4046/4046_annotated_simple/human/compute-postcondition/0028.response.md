Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `tem` that satisfies the conditions, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The number of occurrences of '7' in `x` is equal to the number of occurrences of '4' in `x, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in `x`. Additionally, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`***
