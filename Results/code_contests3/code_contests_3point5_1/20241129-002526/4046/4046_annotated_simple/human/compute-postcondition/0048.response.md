Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned back to `ans`. The value of `ans` may change based on the comparison with `tem`, which is greater than or equal to `n`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, l is an even number, i is the next positive even integer after the current i for the loop to execute, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, tem is greater than or equal to n, and ans is updated to the minimum value of tem that satisfies the conditions.
