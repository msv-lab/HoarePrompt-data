Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l` and increments by 2 until reaching 10. The count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x. The integer value of the concatenated string x is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is the integer value of the concatenated string x.***
