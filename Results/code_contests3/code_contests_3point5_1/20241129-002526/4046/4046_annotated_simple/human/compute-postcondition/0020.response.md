Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Since the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `tem` are not given, we cannot determine the exact values of `ans` or `tem`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+3`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number, `ans` is updated, `i` starts from `l+3`, `tem` is the integer value of the new concatenated string x satisfying certain conditions**
