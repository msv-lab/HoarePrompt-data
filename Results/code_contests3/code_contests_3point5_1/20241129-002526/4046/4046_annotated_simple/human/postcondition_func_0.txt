The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the length of the string representation of `n`, adjusts the length to be even if it is odd, and then iterates through certain combinations of '7' and '4' digits to find the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` where the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's. Finally, it prints the calculated integer `ans`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
