Example Answer:
The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since the initial length of `n` is already an odd number, adding 1 to it will result in an even number. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, l is the length of n + 1 (an even number), ans is 4444477777.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, l is the length of n + 1 (an even number), ans is 4444477777**
