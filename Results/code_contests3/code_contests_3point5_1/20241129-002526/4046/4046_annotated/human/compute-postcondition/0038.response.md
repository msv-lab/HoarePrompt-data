Example Answer:
`tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the string `x`. The previous values of `x` and other variables are unknown, so the output state is: n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, x is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i), i is the next even number less than `l + 2`, tem is the integer obtained by joining `x`.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, x is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i), i is the next even number less than `l + 2`, tem is the integer obtained by joining `x`**
