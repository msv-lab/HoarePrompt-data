According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the conditions related to `x`, `tem`, and their relationship with `n`. Since `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`, it determines the iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, and `tem` is the integer obtained by joining `x` and satisfies the condition `tem >= n` and the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` needs to be the next even number less than `l + 2`, and `x` should be updated based on the product('74', repeat=i) as per the loop statement.

State: **`n` is a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`**
