Example Answer: 
The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Since `ans` may be updated based on the new value of `tem`, `ans` will be the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The variables `n`, `l`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive odd integer, l is incremented by 4 to make it even and remains less than 10, ans is updated based on the new value of tem, i, x, and tem remain unchanged for the next iteration.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is incremented by 4 to make it even and remains less than 10, ans is updated based on the new value of tem, i, x, and tem remain unchanged for the next iteration**
