Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
