Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is updated based on the product ('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the second time, `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be the next even number less than `l + 2`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the string `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is updated based on the product ('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the second time, `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be the next even number less than `l + 2`, `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the string `x`.**
