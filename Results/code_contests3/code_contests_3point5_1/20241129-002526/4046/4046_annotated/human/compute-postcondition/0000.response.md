Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of an integer input. The value of `n` will be whatever the user inputs. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `n` holds the value input by the user.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `n` holds the value input by the user**
