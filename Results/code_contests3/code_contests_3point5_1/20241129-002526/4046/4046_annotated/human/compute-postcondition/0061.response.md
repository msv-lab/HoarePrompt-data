Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains a positive odd integer, `l` remains the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is based on the product('74', repeat=i) where i is the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
