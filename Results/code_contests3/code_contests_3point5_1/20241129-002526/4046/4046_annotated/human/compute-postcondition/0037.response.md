According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `n` and `x` satisfies the conditions mentioned, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is a positive odd integer
- `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`
- `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`
- `x` is '74'
- `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`
- `tem` is 74

For the loop to be executed one more time:
- `i` needs to be increased by 2 to maintain the condition of being the next even number less than `l + 2`
- `x` should be updated based on the product('74', repeat=i) to continue the iteration
- If `x` contains the same number of '7's and '4's, then `tem` should be updated accordingly
- If `x` contains the same number of '7's and '4's and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` should retain the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and 74

State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, x is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i), i is the next even number less than `l + 2`, tem is updated based on the conditions mentioned.**
