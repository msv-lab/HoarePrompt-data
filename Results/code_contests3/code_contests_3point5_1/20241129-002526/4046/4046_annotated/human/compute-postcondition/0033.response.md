Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string obtained by joining the characters of `x`, which is '74'. Therefore, after execution, `tem` will be assigned the integer value 74. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and tem, x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is 74**
