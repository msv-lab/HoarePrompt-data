Example Answer:
`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`. The values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `x` is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the second time, `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer, `l` is the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `x` is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the second time, `i` is the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in x is equal to the count of '4' in x, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
