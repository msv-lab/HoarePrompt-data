Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `n` remains a positive odd integer, `l` remains the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is updated based on the product ('74', repeat=i) for the loop to execute the second time, `i` remains the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` remains greater than or equal to `n`.***
