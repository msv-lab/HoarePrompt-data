Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and tem, x is updated based on the product('74', repeat=i), i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is the integer obtained by joining x. If tem >= n and the count of '7' is equal to the count of '4' in x, the program executes the if part operations. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.**
