According to the code, the loop can execute again if `l` is less than 10 and `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive odd integer, l is incremented to the nearest even number less than 10. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` should be less than 10 and updated to the next even number. Since `l` was incremented to the nearest even number less than 10, it means it is currently an even number. Therefore, the next even number less than 10 would be `l + 2`.
State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the value 4444477777**
