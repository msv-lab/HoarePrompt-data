Postcondition: ***n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and tem, x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is 74. If tem is greater than or equal to n, then ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and 74.***
