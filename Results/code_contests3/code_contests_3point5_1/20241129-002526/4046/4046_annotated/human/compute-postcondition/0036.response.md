Postcondition: ***n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and tem, x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is 74. If x contains the same number of '7's and '4's, then if tem is greater than or equal to n, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and 74.***
