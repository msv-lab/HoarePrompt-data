Example Answer:
The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `tem`. Since `tem` is 74, `ans` will be updated to be the minimum between its current value and 74. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and 74, x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is 74.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the minimum value between the current value of ans and 74, x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is 74**
