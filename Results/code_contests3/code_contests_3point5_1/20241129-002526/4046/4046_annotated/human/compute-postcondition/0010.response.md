Example Answer:
The minimum value between `ans` and `tem` is assigned to `ans`. This means that `ans` will be updated to the smaller value between the current `ans` (4444477777) and `tem`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is increased by 1 to make it even and is less than 10, ans is updated to a new value based on the comparison with tem, count of '7' in x is equal to count of '4' in x, tem is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the characters in x, tem is greater than or equal to n**
