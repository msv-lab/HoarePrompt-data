Example Answer:
The variable `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the characters of `x`. Given that `x` is '74', the integer value of `tem` becomes 74. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the value 4444477777, for the loop to execute x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, and tem is 74.
Output State: **n is a positive odd integer, l is the next even number less than the current value of l + 2, ans retains the value 4444477777, for the loop to execute x is '74', i is the next even number less than l + 2, tem is 74**
