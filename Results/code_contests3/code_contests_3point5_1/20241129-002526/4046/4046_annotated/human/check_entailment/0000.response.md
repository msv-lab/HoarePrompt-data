Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads an integer `n` and finds the least super lucky number that is greater than or equal to `n`, which is what the problem description requires. The program iterates through combinations of '7's and '4's to find the super lucky number with an equal count of both digits. It then prints the minimum value found. The logic in the program ensures that it always produces the correct output as per the problem description.
