You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that positive integers are lucky if their decimal representation doesn't contain digits other than 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Lucky number is super lucky if it's decimal representation contains equal amount of digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 7744, 474477 are super lucky and 4, 744, 467 are not.

One day Petya came across a positive integer n. Help him to find the least super lucky number which is not less than n.

Input

The only line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109). This number doesn't have leading zeroes.

Output

Output the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n.

Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

4500


Output

4747


Input

47


Output

47
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).**
def func():
    n = int(input())
    l, ans = len(str(n)), 4444477777
    if (l & 1) :
        l += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a positive integer, l is the length of n. If the length of n is odd, l is increased by 1 (making it even), and ans remains 4444477777. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of n, l, and ans.
    for i in range(l, 10, 2):
        for x in product('74', repeat=i):
            if x.count('7') == x.count('4'):
                tem = int(''.join(x))
                if tem >= n:
                    ans = min(ans, tem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After all iterations of the loop, `n` remains a positive odd integer, `l` remains the next even number less than the current value of `l + 2`, `ans` retains the minimum value between the current value of `ans` and `tem`, `x` is based on the product('74', repeat=i) where i is the next even number less than `l + 2`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The `func` function reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the length `l` of `n`, and adjusts `l` to be even if it is odd. Then, it iterates through combinations of '7's and '4's of increasing length starting from `l` up to 10. For each combination, if the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's and the formed number is greater than or equal to `n`, it updates `ans` to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and the formed number. Finally, it prints the minimum `ans` value found during the iteration. However, the functionality of the function is incomplete as it lacks clear postconditions and returns.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
