The function accepts user input for a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and calculates a value based on whether `n` is divisible by 10. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adds 1 to the result of `2 * (n / 10)`. It prints the final result, but does not return any value. This function does not handle invalid inputs or provide an explicit return value.
