`s` is assigned the value 1. The initial value of `s` was 0, so now after execution, `s` is 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and is not divisible by 10. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and not divisible by 10; `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and not divisible by 10; `s` is 1**
