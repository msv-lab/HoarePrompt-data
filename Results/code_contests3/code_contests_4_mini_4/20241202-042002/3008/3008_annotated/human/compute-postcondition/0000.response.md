`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which allows `n` to be any non-negative integer that the user inputs. Since `n` is initially defined as a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^18, it remains within that range after input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and now has a value based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and now has a value based on user input.**
