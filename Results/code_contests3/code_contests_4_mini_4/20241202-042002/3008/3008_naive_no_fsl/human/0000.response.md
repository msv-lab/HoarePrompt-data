Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of subtractions needed to reduce the magic number to zero. 

For example, consider the input `24`. The program outputs `5`, which is correct based on the provided example. However, let's analyze a different input, `100`. 

- The expected sequence of operations to reduce `100` to `0` could be:
  - `100 → 90 → 80 → 70 → 60 → 50 → 40 → 30 → 20 → 10 → 0`
  
This results in `10` operations, which is the correct answer.

However, the program would calculate it as follows:
1. It checks if `100 % 10 != 0`, which is false, so `s` remains `0`.
2. It calculates `2 * (100 / 10) + s`, which equals `2 * 10 + 0 = 20`.

Thus, for the input `100`, the program outputs `20`, which is incorrect. The program fails to account for cases where the last digit is `0`, leading to an incorrect calculation of the minimum number of operations. 

Therefore, since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, it is deemed incorrect.
