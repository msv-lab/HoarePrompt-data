Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for input, reading it as a string `n`. It checks if the last digit of `n` is not zero; if so, it sets `s` to 1, otherwise `s` remains 0. The function then calculates and prints the result of the expression \(2 \times \left(\frac{n}{10}\right) + s\). Note that the division of `n` is performed on a string, which will result in a TypeError, as `n` should be converted to an integer before performing arithmetic operations. Therefore, the function may encounter an error when executed.**
