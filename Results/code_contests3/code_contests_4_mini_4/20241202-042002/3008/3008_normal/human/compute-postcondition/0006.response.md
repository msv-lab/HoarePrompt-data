The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The output is not specified, so we cannot determine any return values based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is simply to operate without any input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified.**
