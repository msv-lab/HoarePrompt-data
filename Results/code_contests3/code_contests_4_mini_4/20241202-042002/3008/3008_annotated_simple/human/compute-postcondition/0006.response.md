The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on the assumption that it works with a non-negative integer `n`, where `n` is constrained such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Based on this constraint, the function will return a result based on the value of `n`. 

Since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the return value. However, we can summarize that the function is designed to handle a specific range of non-negative integers. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a non-negative integer n, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, returning a result based on this value.**
