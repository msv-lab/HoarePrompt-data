`The variable s is initialized to 0, and since there are no other operations affecting n or s, the output state reflects the initialization of s. The state of n remains unchanged as it is an input value. Therefore, the Output State is: n is assigned an input value, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; s is 0.`
Output State: **`n` is assigned an input value, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0**
