The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` (from user input) and computes a value based on whether `n` is divisible by 10. It prints `2 * (n / 10) + 1` if `n` is not divisible by 10, and `2 * (n / 10)` if it is. However, it does not return any value and the input is taken as a string, which may lead to a `TypeError` if `n` is not converted to an integer.
