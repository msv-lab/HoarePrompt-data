Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][6][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][6][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][5][3] % mod` and is updated based on `dp[1][5][k - 5] % mod`.***
