According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s` (since the loop runs while `k` is between 1 and `s + 1`). Given that `s` is at least 7, this means `k` can take values from 1 to 7 during the iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` is 0 and `k` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. If `k` is currently equal to `s`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which means it should be updated to `k + 1`.

Thus, if `k` was at its maximum value of 7 in the last iteration, it would be incremented to 8 (which is outside the valid range for the loop). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` at the start of the new iteration would need to be 7, and the next iteration would be when `k` equals 8.

Since `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` do not change during the loop execution, they will remain the same.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 8, `j` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0 for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be at least 8**.
