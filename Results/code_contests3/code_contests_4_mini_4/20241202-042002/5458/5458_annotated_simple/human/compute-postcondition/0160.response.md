The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is defined and greater than or equal to 1; dp[1][j + 1][k] is set to dp[1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
