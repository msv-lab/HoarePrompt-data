The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop that it is within, proceeding to the next iteration. Since this is a control flow statement, the values of the variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
