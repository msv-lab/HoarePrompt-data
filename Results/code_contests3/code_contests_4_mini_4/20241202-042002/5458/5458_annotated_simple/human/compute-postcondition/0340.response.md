Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
