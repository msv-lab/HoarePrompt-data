Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` must be at least 2, `j` is 1 for the first iteration or 2 for the second iteration, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, and `i` is equal to 0. Additionally, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
