According to the code, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that the variable `s` is defined and greater than or equal to 1, as the loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `k` is `s + 1`, which means it is currently at the end of the loop's range. To execute the loop for a second time, we also need to update `k` to its starting value of 1, and ensure that `m` is at least 2 as stated.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are as follows: `k` should be reset to 1, `m` should be at least 2, and `s` should be defined such that it allows the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `dp` array is updated for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, `s` must be defined and greater than or equal to 1**
