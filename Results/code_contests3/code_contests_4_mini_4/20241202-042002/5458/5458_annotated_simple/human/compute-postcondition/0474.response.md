Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 3, then `dp[0][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][2] % mod`, and `dp[2][4][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][3][2 - 3] % mod`.***
