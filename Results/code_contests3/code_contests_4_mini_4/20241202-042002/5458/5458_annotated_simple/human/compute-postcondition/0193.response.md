The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement, but we are skipping any subsequent code that would have been executed in this iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least 2; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
