Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 7, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
