According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop executes for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is at least 7, this means that the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, `k` should be set to 1 for the first iteration. Since the task specifies that for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be at least 2, we need to ensure that `j` is properly initialized to a value of at least 2 before the second iteration.

Therefore, the following states must be adjusted:
- `k` is now 1 at the start of the first execution.
- To allow for a second execution of the loop, `j` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be at least 2**
