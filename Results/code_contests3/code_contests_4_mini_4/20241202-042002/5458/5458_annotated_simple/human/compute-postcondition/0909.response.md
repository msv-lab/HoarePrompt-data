Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 3, and `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
