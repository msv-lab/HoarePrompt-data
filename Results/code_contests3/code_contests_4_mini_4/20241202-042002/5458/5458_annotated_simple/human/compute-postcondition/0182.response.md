Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is defined and greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.***
