The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is still being updated from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is still being updated from dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
