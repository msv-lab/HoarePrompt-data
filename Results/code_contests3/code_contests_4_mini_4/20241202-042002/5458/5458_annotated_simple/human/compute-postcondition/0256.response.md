Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][k]` is set to 1, with the values of `dp` at indices [0][4][1], [0][4][2], and [0][4][3] updated based on the loop's logic. Otherwise, if `i` is 3, `j` is 4, then `dp[0][5][k]` is updated to `dp[0][4][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
