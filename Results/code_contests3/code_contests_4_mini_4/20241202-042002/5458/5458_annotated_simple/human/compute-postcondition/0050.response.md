The values of the variables do not change, but the code indicates to continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is updated and not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
