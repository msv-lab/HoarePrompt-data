Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 7, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `m` must be at least 2 for it to execute a second time; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue the execution.**
