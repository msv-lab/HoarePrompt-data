Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and the values of `dp` at indices [0][4][1], [0][4][2], and [0][4][3] are updated based on the loop's logic. The value of `i` is not equal to 0. For the loop to execute a fourth time, `m` must be at least 4.***
