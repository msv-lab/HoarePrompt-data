Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than 1, `j` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
