The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the rest of the code inside the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration of that loop. Since the initial values of the variables are not changed by this statement, the output state reflects their current values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][k] = dp[1][3][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
