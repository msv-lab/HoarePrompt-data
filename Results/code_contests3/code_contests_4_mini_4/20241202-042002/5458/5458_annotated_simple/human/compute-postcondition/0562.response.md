The code snippet `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but the flow of control will jump to the next iteration of the closest enclosing loop. Since there is no information about the surrounding loop, I will note that we are continuing within that loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `dp[0][4][1]` is now equal to `dp[0][3][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
