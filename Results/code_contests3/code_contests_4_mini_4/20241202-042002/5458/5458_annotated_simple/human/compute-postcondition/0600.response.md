According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, and the loop variable `k` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1 and will become 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `s` is at least 2. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, k is 2**
