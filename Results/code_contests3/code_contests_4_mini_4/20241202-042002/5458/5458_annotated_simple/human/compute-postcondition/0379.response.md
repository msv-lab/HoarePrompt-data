Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is set to `N`; `i` is 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 7; `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, since there is no else part, the program proceeds without any changes to the values.***
