The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no variables being modified or values being assigned in this case, the output state regarding the variables remains unaffected. The values of the variables are unchanged, and we simply skip the current iteration of the loop we are in.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0 and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
