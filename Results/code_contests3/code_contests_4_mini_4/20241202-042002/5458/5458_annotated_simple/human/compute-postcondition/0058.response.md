The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is affecting the values in a multidimensional array `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. 
2. The value of `j` is currently 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
3. The value of `k` is currently 4.

Therefore, the expression is accessing `dp[1][3][4]` and assigning it the value of `dp[1][2][4]`. 

The other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`) have not changed, but we have updated a value in the `dp` array based on the values derived from `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and dp[1][3][4] is updated to the value of dp[1][2][4].**
