According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit specified by `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and we know that `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7.

Since `k` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 4. For the loop to continue executing, `s` must be greater than 3. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 4; for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than 3.**
