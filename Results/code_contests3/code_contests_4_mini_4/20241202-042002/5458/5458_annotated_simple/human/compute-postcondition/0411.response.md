The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
