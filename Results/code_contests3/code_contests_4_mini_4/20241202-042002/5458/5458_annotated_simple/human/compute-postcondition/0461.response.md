The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no specific iteration context is provided, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1; the value of `dp[0][4][1]` is set to the value of `dp[0][3][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
