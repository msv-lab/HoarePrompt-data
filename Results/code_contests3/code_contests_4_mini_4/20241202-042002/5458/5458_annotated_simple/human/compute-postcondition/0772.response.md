Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `dp` is fully updated, `j` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
