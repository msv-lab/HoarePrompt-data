Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
