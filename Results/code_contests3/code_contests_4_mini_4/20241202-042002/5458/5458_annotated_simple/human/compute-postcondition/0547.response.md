The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
