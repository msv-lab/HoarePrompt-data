Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - 1] % mod`, while `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.***
