According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute again if `k` is incremented. 

Since `k` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, for the next iteration to be valid, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` now will be 3). 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `k` being 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
