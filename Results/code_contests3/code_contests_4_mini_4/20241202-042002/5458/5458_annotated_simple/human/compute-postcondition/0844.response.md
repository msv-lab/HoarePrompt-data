According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 7, meaning `k` can take on values from 1 to 7. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to 7.**
