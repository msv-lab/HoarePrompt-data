Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 for the second iteration, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `dp[2][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][2][1]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
