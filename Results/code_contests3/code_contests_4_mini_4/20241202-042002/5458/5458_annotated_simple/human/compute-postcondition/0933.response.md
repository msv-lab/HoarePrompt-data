The function `func` does not take any parameters directly, as it is designed to read multiple datasets from input until the termination condition is met (when N, M, S are all 0). The datasets consist of three values: N, M, and S, where N is an integer within the range of 1 to 7, M is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and S is a positive integer between 1 and 3000. After processing the input datasets, the function will produce a specific output based on those values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple datasets of integers N, M, and S, and processes them until a terminating condition (N, M, S all being 0) is met.**
