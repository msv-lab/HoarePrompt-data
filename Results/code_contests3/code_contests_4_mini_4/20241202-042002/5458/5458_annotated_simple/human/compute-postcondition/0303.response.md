The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining iterations and move to the next iteration of the loop that contains it (if any). Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop due to the `continue` statement.
