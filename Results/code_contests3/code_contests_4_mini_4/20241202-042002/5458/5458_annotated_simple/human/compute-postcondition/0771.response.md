The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
