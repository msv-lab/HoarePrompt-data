Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is updated to 1 or more depending on the iterations; `j` is incremented based on the loop iterations; `k` is equal to `s + 1` after all iterations; `dp` array is updated based on the conditions set in the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` being set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, else it is updated based on previous values.**
