According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2, allowing the loop to execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
