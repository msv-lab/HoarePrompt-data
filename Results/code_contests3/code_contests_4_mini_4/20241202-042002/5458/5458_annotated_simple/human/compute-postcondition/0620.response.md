Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is `N^2 - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 7, `k` has taken values from 1 to `s`, and `dp` contains computed values based on the conditions set in the loop for all combinations of `j` and `k`.**
