Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 7, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1 because `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is greater than 0, no changes are made to `dp` since `j` is not greater than `k`.***
