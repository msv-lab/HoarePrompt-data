Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the array at indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` is updated to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; if `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the state.***
