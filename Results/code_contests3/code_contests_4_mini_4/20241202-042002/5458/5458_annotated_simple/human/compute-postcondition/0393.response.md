The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, while the values of the variables do not change, we are skipping the rest of the code block in the loop where this `continue` is encountered.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is not equal to 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
