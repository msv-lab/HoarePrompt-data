According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 7, which means it is possible for the loop to execute again for `k = 7`. 

In the current state, the loop has executed with `k` being 1 less than `s`, so at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `k` was 7 in the last iteration, it will now be 8 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute once more, `s` must still be at least 8. 

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 8, `k` is 8**
