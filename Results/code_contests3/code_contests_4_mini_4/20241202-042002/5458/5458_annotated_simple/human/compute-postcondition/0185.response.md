Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is defined and greater than or equal to 1, and the `dp` array is updated at indices [`i + 1 & 1`][`j + 1`][`k`] from [`i + 1 & 1`][`j`][`k`] if `j` is greater than `k`.***
