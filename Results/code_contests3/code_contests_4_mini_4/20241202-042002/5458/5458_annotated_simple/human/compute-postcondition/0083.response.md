The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is not 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least 4, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
