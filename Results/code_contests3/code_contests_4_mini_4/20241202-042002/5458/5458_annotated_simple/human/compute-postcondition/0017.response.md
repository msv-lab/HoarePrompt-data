The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
