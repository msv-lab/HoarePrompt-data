The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` accesses and modifies a specific element in a multidimensional array `dp`. The variables affected by this code are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. This means we are accessing the second dimension of the first array in `dp`.
2. The value of `j` is at least 2. Therefore, `j + 1` is at least 3. We will access the third dimension of `dp` based on this value.
3. The value of `k` is 2, which remains unchanged.

Since the code assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][2]`, the state of `dp` changes accordingly, but the complete state of `dp` is not provided, so we cannot specify the exact effect on `dp`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

The output state will reflect the unchanged values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i`, along with the modification made to `dp`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0; `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1**.
