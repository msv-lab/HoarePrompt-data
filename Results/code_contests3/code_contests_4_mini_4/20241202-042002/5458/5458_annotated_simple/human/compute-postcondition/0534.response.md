According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its upper limit defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
