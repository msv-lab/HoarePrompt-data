The code assigns the value `1` to the multi-dimensional array `dp` at the indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is at least `2`, thus `j + 1` is at least `3`. The value of `k` is `2`. Therefore, the indices being assigned are `1`, at least `3`, and `2` respectively.

The states of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i`) are not changed by this assignment. Thus, the Output State is: `N` is between `1` and `7`, `n` is at least `1`, `m` is at least `2`, `s` is at least `7`, `k` is `2`, `j` is at least `2`, `i` is `0`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.**
