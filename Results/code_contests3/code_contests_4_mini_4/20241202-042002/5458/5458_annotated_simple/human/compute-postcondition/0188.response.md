Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the `dp` array is updated at position [1][j + 1][1] with the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, and `k` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
