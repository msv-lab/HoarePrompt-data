Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2 for the second iteration; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 1 for the first iteration; `dp[2][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][2][1]`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
