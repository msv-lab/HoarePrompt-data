Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 1, `dp[1][5][1]` remains unchanged due to an invalid index access on the right-hand side.***
