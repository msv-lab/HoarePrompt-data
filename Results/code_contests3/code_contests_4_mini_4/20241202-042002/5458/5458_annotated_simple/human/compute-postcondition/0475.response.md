According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would be equal to `s`, therefore for the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1. Since `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute properly in the previous iteration, we can infer that `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least 4, k is 2**
