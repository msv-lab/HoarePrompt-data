Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a fifth time, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][4][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][4][3]` is updated by adding `dp[1][3][0] % mod` to it.***
