Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
