According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit set by `n ** 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, which means `n ** 2` can range from 1 to 49 (since the maximum value of `N` is 7, thus `n` can be at most 7).

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, it must hold that `i < n ** 2`. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to continue executing, `n ** 2` must be greater than 2, which implies that `N` must be at least 2 (since `n` must be at least 2 to satisfy this condition).

In summary, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 2,
- `N` must be at least 2 (which implies `n` must be at least 2).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions, particularly for `dp[1][j + 1][k]` reflecting the computed values.**
