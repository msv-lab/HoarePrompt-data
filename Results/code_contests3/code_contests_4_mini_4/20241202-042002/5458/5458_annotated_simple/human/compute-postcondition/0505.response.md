The line of code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with the operation involving the modulo operation with `mod`. The variable `k` is given as 5, and since `j` is greater than `k`, it implies that the assignment will not take place as the condition to proceed is not met. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 5; `j` is greater than `k`; and no assignment takes place in `dp` due to the condition not being met.**
