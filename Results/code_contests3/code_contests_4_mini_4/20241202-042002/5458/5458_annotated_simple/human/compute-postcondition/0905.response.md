The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the program skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop it is inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 3, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
