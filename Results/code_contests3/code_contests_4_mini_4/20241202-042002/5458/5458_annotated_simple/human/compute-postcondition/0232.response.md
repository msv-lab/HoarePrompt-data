Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a fourth time, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][4][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop without changing `dp`.***
