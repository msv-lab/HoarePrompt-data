The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which will be split and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `s` can change based on the input. The previous values of `n` (which is `N`), `m` (greater than or equal to 1), and `s` (at least 7) are impacted by this assignment. 

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s` after the operation will depend on the input, we can summarize that `n` now takes on a new integer value, `m` takes on a value that is at least 1, and `s` takes on a value that is at least 7. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is the new integer from input, `m` is the new integer from input which is ≥ 1, `s` is the new integer from input which is ≥ 7.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is the new integer from input, `m` is the new integer from input which is ≥ 1, `s` is the new integer from input which is ≥ 7.**
