The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
