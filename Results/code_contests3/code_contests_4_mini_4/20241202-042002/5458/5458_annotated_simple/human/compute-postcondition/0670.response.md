The `continue` statement does not modify any variable values directly but instructs the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no loop variables provided, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
