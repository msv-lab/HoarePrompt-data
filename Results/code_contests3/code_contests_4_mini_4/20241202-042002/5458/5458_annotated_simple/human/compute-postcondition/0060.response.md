Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, and `s` is at least 4. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][4]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][2][4]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change to the state.***
