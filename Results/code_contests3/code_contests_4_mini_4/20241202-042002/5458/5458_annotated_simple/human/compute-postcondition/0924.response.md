Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 5, `j` is at least 3, and `i` is 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, the loop continues executing with the same values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i`.***
