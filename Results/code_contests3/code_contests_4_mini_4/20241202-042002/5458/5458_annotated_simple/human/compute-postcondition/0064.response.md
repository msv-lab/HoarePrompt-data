According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Given that `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, we can conclude that `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 5. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 5.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is equal to 0; `j` is equal to 2; `k` is 5, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 5.**
