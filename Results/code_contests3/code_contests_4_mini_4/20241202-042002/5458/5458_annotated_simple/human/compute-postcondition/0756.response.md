The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in, proceeding to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
