The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the specified indices of the `dp` array. 

- The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1` (bitwise AND operation).
- The value of `j` is `3`, so `j + 1` is `4`.
- The value of `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment affects the `dp` array at the indices `dp[1][4][1]`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7
- `n` is set to `N`
- `i` is `0`
- `m` is at least `3`
- `j` is `3`
- `s` is at least `7`
- `k` is `1`

The other variables (`N`, `n`, `m`, `s`) remain unaffected by this specific assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, and the assignment `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.**
