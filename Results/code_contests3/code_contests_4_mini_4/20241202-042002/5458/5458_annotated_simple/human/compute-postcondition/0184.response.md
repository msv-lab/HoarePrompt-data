The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is defined and greater than or equal to 1, `dp` array updated at indices [`i + 1 & 1`][`j + 1`][`k`] from [`i + 1 & 1`][`j`][`k`] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
