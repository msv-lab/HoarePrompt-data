The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a 3D list or array named `dp`. 

1. The variable `i` is equal to `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. 
2. The bitwise operation `1 & 1` results in `1` (since both bits are 1).
3. The variable `j` is equal to `2`, so `j + 1` is `3`.
4. The variable `k` is equal to `3`.

Thus, the left side of the equation becomes `dp[1][3][3]`, and the right side becomes `dp[1][2][3]`.

The assignment indicates that the value of `dp[1][2][3]` is being copied to `dp[1][3][3]`. 

As a result, the value of `dp[1][3][3]` is now equal to whatever value `dp[1][2][3]` held previously. The values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`.**
