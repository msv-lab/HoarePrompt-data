According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, since the range of `k` is from 1 to `s + 1`. The current states indicate that `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1. 

Since we need `s` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we should set `s` to 1 or more. Additionally, `k` will start at 1 during the first execution of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1, and the initial value of `k` will be 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
