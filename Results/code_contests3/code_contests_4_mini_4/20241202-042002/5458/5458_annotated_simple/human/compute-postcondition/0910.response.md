According to the code, the loop executes as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 7. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. Since `s` is at least 7, it remains valid for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 4, `j` is at least 3, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` which is at least 7.**
