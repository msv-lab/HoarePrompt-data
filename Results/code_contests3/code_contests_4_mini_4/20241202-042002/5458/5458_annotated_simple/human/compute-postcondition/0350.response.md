Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 7, and `k` is 7. After all iterations, `dp[1][2][k]` will be updated based on the conditions set in the loop, resulting in a fully processed `dp` array for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
