The assignment updates a specific element in a multidimensional array `dp` using the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will compute the result of `i + 1` bitwise ANDed with `1`, which helps to determine the row index in the array. For `i = 2`, this evaluates to `3 & 1`, which results in `1`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated with the value from `dp[1][j][k]`. Given that `j` is `1`, it evaluates to `dp[1][2][k]`.

Since `k` is `3`, the states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][k]` is updated to `dp[1][1][k]`.**
