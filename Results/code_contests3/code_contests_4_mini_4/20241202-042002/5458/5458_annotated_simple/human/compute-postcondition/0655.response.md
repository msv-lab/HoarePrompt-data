The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the block we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]` while continuing in the loop or block.
