According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `m` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `m` must be greater than or equal to 4**
