The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
