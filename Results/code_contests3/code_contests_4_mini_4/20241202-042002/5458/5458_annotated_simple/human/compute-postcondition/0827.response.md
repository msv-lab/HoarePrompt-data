Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, and `k` is equal to 7. The `dp` array has been updated based on the logic of the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` reflecting the cumulative calculations depending on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
