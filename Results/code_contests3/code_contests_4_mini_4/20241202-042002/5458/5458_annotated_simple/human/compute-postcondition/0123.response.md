According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The for loop starts from `k = 1` and continues up to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3, since `k` must remain less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3.**
