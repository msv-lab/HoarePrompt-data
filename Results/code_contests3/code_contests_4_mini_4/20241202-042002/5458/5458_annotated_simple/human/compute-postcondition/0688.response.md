The values of the variables do not change, but the code indicates that we skip the current iteration of the loop we are inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 9, `k` is 9, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
