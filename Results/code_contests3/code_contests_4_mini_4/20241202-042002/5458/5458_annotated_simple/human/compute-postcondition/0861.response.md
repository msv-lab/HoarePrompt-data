Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 8, `j` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is added to it modulo `mod`.***
