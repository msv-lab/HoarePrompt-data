According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `s`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Since `k` is currently equal to `s`, it indicates that the loop is about to finish its last iteration if `s` is already at its current value.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be increased by at least 1. Therefore, the conditions that need to be satisfied are:
- `s` must be at least 4 (to ensure the loop can execute at least one more time).
- `k` will be 1 (the starting value of `k` for the next iteration).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least 4**
