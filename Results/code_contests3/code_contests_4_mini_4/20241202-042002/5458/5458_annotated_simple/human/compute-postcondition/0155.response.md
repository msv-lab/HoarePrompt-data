Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is defined and greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
