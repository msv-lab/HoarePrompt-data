The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves a multidimensional array assignment. Here, `i + 1 & 1` calculates the index for the first dimension of `dp`, `j + 1` calculates the index for the second dimension, and `k` is used as the index for the third dimension.

1. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1` (the bitwise AND operation).
2. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.
3. The value of `k` is 5.

Thus, the indices are calculated as follows:
- First dimension index: `1`
- Second dimension index: `3`
- Third dimension index: `5`

The assignment `dp[1][3][5] = 1` sets the value at these indices in the `dp` array to `1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is equal to 0; `j` is equal to 2; `k` is 5; `dp[1][3][5]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is equal to 0; `j` is equal to 2; `k` is 5; `dp[1][3][5]` is set to 1.**
