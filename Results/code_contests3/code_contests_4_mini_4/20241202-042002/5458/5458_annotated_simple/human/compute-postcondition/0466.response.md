According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 3 or specifically 3, and `s` is at least 3. 

If `k` is currently at its maximum value (which is equal to `s`), for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which means the loop would not execute again. However, if `k` is less than `s`, then the loop can execute one more time with `k` incremented by 1.

Therefore, if `k` is currently less than `s`, the next state must reflect that `k` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to 3.**
