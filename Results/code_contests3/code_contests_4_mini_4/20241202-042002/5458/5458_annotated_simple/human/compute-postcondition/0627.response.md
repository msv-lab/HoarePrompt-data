According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n` which determines the range of the loop. The expression `n ** 2` will compute the number of iterations for the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, since `1 ** 2` is 1, which means the loop will run at least once. 

Considering the initial state:
- `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, but this does not directly affect the loop execution.
- `n` is derived from input, and it must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
- `m` is a new integer which is ≥ 1, but it does not affect the loop execution.
- `s` is also a new integer which is ≥ 7, which does not impact the loop execution.
- `dp` is initialized and does not affect the execution of the loop.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will start from 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` needs to be at least 1, and `i` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be at least 1.**
