Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, then the program updates `dp` based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `i` from 0 to `N^2 - 1`, `j` from 1 to `m`, and `k` from 1 to `s`, and breaks out of the most internal loop; otherwise, the program does not execute any actions as there is no else part; `dp` is initialized as a 2D list with dimensions (2, m + 2) and (s + 1) filled with zeros.**
