The code snippet is performing an assignment to a multidimensional array `dp`. We need to identify the values of the variables involved in the indexing of this array and their impact.

1. The indexing expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value for the first index:
   - `i` is currently `3`, so `i + 1` equals `4`.
   - The bitwise operation `4 & 1` results in `0` (since `4` in binary is `100` and `1` is `001`, the result is `000`).

2. The second index is `j + 1`, where `j` is `5`:
   - `j + 1` equals `6`.

3. The third index is `k`, which is `2`.

Thus, the assignment to the array `dp` becomes:
```
dp[0][6][2] = 1
```

None of the other variables (`N`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) change as a result of this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated assignment in the `dp` array, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0; `dp[0][6][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
