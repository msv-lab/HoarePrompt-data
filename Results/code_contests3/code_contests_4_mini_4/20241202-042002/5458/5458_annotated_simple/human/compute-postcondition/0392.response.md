The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a 3D array `dp`. The left side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and the right side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` both depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on the current value of `i`. As `i` is not equal to 0, `i` could be 1, 2, ... and so on.
2. The value of `j + 1` is 4 because `j` is initially 3.
3. The variable `k` is equal to 1.

However, since the specific values of the 3D array `dp` are not provided, we cannot definitively calculate the values assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that the assignment takes place but without knowing the actual values of the `dp` array:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is not equal to 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
