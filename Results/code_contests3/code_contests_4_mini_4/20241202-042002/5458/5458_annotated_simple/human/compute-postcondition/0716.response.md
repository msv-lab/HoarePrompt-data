Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.***
