According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2, and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` is incremented, it will become at least 3, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is at least 3, and `i` is 0, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3.**
