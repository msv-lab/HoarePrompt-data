The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop in which it resides. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 4; `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
