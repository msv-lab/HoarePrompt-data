The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this statement; however, it indicates that the program will move to the next iteration of the loop it is currently in. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 for the second iteration, `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`; dp[2][3][1] is assigned the value of dp[2][2][1], and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
