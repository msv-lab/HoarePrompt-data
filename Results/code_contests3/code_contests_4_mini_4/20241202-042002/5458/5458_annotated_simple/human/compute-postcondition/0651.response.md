According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate while `k` takes on values from `1` to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 7, the loop can execute again as `k` will be incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be updated to 3. Therefore, we must ensure that `s` is still at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
