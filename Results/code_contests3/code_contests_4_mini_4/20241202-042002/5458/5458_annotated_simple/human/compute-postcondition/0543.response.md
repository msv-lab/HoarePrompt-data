According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3.**
