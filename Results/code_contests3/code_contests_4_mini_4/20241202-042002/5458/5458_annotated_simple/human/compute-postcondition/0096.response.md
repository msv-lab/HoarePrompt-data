Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 1), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, given that `s` is at least 2. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `N` remains within the specified range.***
