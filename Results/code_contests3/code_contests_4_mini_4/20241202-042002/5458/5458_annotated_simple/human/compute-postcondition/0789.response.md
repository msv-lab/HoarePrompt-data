The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
