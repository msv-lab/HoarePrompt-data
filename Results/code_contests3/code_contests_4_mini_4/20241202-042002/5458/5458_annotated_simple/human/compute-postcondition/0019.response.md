Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and since `j` is greater than `k`, the execution continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
