The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 8, `k` is 8, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 8, `k` is 8, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
