According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 7, meaning the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be at least 2 since `k` will now be 2.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.**
