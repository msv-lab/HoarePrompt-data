According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `m` is at least 1, since it iterates from `1` to `m + 1`. 

Given that the initial state has `j` set to `m + 1`, this means that `j` will start at `m + 1` and won't satisfy the loop's range condition. For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` should be initialized to `1`, which is the starting point of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `m` is at least `1` and reset `j` to `1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` array is updated based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
