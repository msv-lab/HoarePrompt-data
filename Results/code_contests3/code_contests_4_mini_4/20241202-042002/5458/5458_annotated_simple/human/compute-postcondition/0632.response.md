The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a 3D array `dp`. 

First, we need to evaluate the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` will determine the first index. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. Thus, the first index is `1`.
- `j + 1` will determine the second index. Given that `j` is `1`, `j + 1` equals `2`. Therefore, the second index is `2`.
- `k` is `1`, so the third index remains `1`.

Thus, the code assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][2][1]`. The initial values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and the specific states of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change as a result of this operation.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.**
