Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
