According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, and since `m` is at least 1, the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Currently, `j` is at least 1, so if we increment `j`, it will be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, if `j` is at least 2, then `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0.**
