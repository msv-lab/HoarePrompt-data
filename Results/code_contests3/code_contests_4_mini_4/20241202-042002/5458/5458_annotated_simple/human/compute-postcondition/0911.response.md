The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` accesses and modifies a specific element in a multidimensional array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 0, this expression evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` results in `1`.

Next, `j + 1` can be any value greater than or equal to 4 since `j` is at least 3. The value of `k` remains as 4, as given.

This means the specific element `dp[1][j + 1][4]` is being assigned the value `1`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is at least 3,
- `k` is 4.

The output state reflects these conditions and the assignment made in the multidimensional array.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 4, `j` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][4]` is assigned the value 1.**
