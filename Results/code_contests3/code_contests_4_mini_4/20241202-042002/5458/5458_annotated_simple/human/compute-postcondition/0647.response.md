Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no action is taken and the remaining state of the variables remains unchanged.***
