The values of the variables do not change with the `continue` statement, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2; `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
