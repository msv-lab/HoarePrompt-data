Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][2]` is set to `dp[1][3][2] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
