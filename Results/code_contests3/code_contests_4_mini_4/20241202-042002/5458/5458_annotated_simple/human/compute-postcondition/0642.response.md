According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the values are as follows: `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. Given that `s` is at least 7, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, after the current iteration, `k` will be 2. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is still valid since `s` is at least 7.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to 7.**
