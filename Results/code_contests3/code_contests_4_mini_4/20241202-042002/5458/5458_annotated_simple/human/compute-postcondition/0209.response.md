According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which is used in the range defined by `n ** 2`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, the maximum value for `n ** 2` can be 49 (when `N` is 7) and the minimum value can be 4 (when `N` is 2). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, the next state will be `i` equal to 3. The loop can continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`; thus, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3. 

Since `N` can be at least 2, `n` must be at least 2, which gives us `n ** 2` as at least 4. As `i` is now 3, for the loop to execute again, we need `n` to be at least 2 to keep `n ** 2` greater than 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3.**
