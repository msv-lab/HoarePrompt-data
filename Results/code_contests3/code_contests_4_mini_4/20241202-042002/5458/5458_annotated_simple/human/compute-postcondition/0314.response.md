The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned from input values, and we break out of the most internal loop.
