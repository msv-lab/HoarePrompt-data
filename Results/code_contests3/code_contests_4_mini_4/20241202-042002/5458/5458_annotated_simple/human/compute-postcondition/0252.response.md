The values of the variables do not change, but the statement indicates to continue to the next iteration of a loop or the next statement following a loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `dp[0][5][k]` is updated to `dp[0][4][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of a loop or statement.
