Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
