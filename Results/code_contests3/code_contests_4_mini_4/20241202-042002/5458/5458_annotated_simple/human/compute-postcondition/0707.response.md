Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
