The values of the variables do not change with the `continue` statement; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 5; and `dp[1][3][5]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][5]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
