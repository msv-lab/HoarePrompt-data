Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 7, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and execution continues. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the execution does not proceed with this assignment.***
