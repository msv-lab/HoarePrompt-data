Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][6][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[0][6][2]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[1][5][-3] % mod`.***
