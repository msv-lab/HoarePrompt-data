The statement assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `j` is greater than `k`, which means that `j + 1` will be greater than `k`. The states of other variables (`N`, `m`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
