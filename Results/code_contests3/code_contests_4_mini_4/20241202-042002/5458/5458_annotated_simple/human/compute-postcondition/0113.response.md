The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a data structure `dp` with calculated indices based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

First, we need to evaluate the indices:
- For `i`, the current value is 2. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` calculates to `3 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- For `j`, the current value is 1. Thus, `j + 1` calculates to `2`.
- For `k`, the current value is 2.

Now, we can summarize the assignment:
- We are assigning `1` to `dp[1][2][2]`.

The previous values of the affected variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 2; `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
