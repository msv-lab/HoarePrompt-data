The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 8, `j` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][8]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][8]`, and we continue to the next iteration.
