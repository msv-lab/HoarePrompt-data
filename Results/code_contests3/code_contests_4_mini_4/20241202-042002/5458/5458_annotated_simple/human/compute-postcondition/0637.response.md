The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply causes the loop to skip the remaining code for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, but we note that we will skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
