The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, the loop has executed at least once with `s` greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
