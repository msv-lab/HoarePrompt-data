Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
