According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 3, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
