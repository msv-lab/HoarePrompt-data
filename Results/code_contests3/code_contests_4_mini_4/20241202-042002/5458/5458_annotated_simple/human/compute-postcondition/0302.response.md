The code snippet involves a multidimensional array `dp`, and the assignment is made based on the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the new index for the first dimension of the `dp` array. For `i = 3`, `i + 1` is `4`, and `4 & 1` evaluates to `0`. Thus, we are using the index `0` for the first dimension of `dp`.
  
2. The value of `j + 1` gives us `6` since `j = 5`.

3. The index `k` remains `4`.

4. The assignment `dp[0][6][4] = dp[0][5][4]` means we are copying the value from one index of the `dp` array to another. The values of `N`, `s`, and other variables remain unchanged.

The values of the variables affected are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The output does not change their values but indicates the operation performed with `dp`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and we assign dp[0][6][4] = dp[0][5][4].**
