The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop, proceeding to the next iteration if applicable. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 5, `j` is at least 3, `i` is 0; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
