Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented to `k + 1` if `k < s` and `s` is still greater than `k + 1`, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
