The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is the new integer from input, `m` is the new integer from input which is ≥ 1, `s` is the new integer from input which is ≥ 7 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
