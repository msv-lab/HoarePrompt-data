The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is set to `N`; `i` is 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `j` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 7; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
