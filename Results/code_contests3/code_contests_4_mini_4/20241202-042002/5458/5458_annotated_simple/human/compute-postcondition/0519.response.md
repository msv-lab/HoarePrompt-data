According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. This means `n ** 2` can range from 1 (if N=1) to 49 (if N=7).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `n ** 2` must be greater than 1. 

Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n ** 2` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n ** 2` must be greater than 2**
