The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to the `dp` array. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0`. The value of `j + 1` is `4` since `j` is `3`, and `k` remains `1`. 

Thus, `dp[0][4][1]` will be assigned the value from `dp[0][3][1] % mod`. The previous values of `dp[0][3][1]` are not specified in the initial state, but `mod` is assumed to be a predefined constant that keeps the values within a certain range.

In this case, since we do not have specific values for the `dp` array or for `mod`, we cannot determine the exact values being assigned. However, the state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `j` is 3; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 1; `dp[0][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][1] % mod`.**
