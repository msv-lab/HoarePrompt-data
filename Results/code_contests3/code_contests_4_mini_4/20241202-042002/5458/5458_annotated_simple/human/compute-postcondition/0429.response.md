Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 for the second iteration, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[2][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[2][2][1]`, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
