The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is incremented to `k + 1` for the loop to execute one more time; `k` must be less than `s; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
