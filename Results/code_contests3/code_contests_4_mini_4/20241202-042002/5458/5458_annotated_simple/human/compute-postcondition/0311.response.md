Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `i` from 0 to `N^2 - 1`, `j` from 1 to `m`, and `k` from 1 to `s`; the result of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod` is printed.**
