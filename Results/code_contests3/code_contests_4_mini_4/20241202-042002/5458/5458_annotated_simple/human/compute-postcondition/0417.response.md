Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m`, `s` is at least 7, and `k` has values processed from 1 to `s`. The `dp` array is fully populated based on the conditions set in the loop for all combinations of `j` and `k`.**
