The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a fifth time, `k` is 3, and `dp[0][4][3]` is now equal to `dp[0][3][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
