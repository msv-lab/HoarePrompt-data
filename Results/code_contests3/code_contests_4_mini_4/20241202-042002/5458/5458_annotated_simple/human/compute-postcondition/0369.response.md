The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 7, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
