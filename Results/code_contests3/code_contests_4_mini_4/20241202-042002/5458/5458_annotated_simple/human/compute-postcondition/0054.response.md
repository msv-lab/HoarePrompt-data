Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, `k` is equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is updated and not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][2][1] % mod.***
