According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2 (since `j` will be incremented to 2), and `j` will be updated to 2 in the next iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2.**
