Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least `s + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to undefined access on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]***.
