The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to `dp[1][2][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
