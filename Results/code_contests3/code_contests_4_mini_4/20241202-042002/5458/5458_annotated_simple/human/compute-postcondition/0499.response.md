According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is at least 4, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and the loop will increment `k` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 5, and `s` must still be at least 5 to ensure that the loop conditions are satisfied.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 5, and `k` is 5.**
