The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1; `dp[0][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
