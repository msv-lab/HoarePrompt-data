Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no actions are taken. In the else part, `k` is incremented to `k + 1` while ensuring `k` is less than `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
