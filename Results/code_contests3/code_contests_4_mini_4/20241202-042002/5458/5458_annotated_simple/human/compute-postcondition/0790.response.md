Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no changes occur since there is no else part.***
