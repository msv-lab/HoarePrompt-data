The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop that is being executed. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only impact is that the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing any subsequent code that follows the `continue` statement within that iteration.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute a fourth time, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][4][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
