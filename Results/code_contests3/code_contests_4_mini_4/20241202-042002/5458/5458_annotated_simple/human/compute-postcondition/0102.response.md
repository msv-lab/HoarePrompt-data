Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time, `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to equal the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration.***
