According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s` (inclusive). The current value of `k` is 8, and `s` is at least 8, which means the loop can execute one more time as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 8. For the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 9. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 9.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 9, `k` is 9**
