Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` added to it.***
