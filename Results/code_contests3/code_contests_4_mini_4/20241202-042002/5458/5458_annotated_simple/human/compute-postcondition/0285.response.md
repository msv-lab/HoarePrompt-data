The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `dp[0][6][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][5][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
