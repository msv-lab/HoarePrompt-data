The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement within the current block. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0; dp[1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[1][j][k], and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
