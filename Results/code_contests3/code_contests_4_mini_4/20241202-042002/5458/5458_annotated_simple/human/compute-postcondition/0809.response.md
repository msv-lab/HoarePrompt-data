According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The value of `k` at the end of the last iteration is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, the new value of `k` will be 2.

Since the loop is designed to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and given that `s` is at least 7, `k` being 2 means the loop will execute again.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2**
