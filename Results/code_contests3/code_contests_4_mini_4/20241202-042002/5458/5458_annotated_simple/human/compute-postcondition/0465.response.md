Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `dp[0][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][1] % mod`, and an attempt to access `dp[1][3][-2] % mod` resulted in an invalid index access.***
