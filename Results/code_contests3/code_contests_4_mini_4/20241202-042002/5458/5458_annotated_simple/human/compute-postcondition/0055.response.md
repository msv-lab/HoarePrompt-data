According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at 3, and `s` is at least 2. Since `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `k` will be 4.

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 4 because `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is equal to 2, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time.**
