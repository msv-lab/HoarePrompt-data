The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining part of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables themselves do not change in this case. The code indicates that we are in a loop, but no specific values are modified. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
