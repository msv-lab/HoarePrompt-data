The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multidimensional list or array `dp` using the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- The operation `i + 1 & 1` indicates a bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. This will yield `0` if `i + 1` is even and `1` if `i + 1` is odd.
- The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so `j + 1` is now the new index for the second dimension of `dp`.
- The variable `k` is already given as `s + 1`.

The output state does not change the values of `N`, `s`, or `k`, but it modifies the `dp` array at the calculated indices.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least `s + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least `s + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
