Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated based on the operation performed.***
