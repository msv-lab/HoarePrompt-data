The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves accessing and modifying a 3D array `dp`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1, and `1 & 1` equals 1. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1.
2. The value of `j + 1` is 2, because `j` is 1.
3. The value of `k` is 3, which remains unchanged.

Thus, we are modifying `dp[1][2][3]` based on the value of `dp[1][1][3]`. The previous state of `dp[1][1][3]` will be assigned to `dp[1][2][3]`.

The values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not altered by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`.**
