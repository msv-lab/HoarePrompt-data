Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration. The `dp` array has been updated based on the conditions of the loops executed, specifically `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will contain values derived from the computations during the iterations, reflecting combinations as determined by the conditions related to `j` and `k`.**
