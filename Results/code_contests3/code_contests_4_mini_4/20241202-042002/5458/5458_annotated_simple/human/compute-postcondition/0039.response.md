Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least `s + 1`; `k` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
