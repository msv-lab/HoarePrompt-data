According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is equal to `s` (7), `j` is 3, and `dp` is fully updated based on the iterations of `k`.**
