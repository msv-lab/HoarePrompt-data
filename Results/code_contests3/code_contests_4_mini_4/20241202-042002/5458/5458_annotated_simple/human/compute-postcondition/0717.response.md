According to the provided code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. Given that the state at the end of the previous iteration has `k` equal to 2 and `s` is at least 7, the next value of `k` will be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means the loop has executed for `k = 1` and `k = 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be 3.

Since `s` is at least 7, it is still valid for the loop to execute again. Therefore, to summarize the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration: `k` will be updated to 3, while all other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to 0.**
