The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the specified indices. Since `i` is `0`, `j` is `4`, and `k` is `4`, we need to evaluate the indices:

1. `i + 1 & 1`: This evaluates as `0 + 1 & 1` which results in `1 & 1` = `1`.
2. `j + 1`: This evaluates as `4 + 1` which results in `5`.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][5][4]` to `1`. The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4 in the fourth iteration, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][5][4]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4 in the fourth iteration, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][5][4]` is set to 1.**
