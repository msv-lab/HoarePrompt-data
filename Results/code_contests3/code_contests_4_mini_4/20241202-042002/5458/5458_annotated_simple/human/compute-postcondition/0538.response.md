The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration if it is inside a loop. Since the initial state does not specify any loop context, we can only state that we are continuing with no changes in the variable values. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][2][2]` and we continue with no changes in values.**
