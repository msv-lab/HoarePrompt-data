The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the most internal loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][k]` is updated to `dp[1][1][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
