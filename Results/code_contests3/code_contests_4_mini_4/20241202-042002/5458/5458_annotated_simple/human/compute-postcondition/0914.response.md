The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables directly. Instead, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 4, `j` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 4, `j` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
