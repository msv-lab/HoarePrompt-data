The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least `s + 1`; `k` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute one more time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue in the most internal loop.
