Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
