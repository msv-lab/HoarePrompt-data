Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the element of the `dp` array is updated using the calculation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
