Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the state of the program. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` after adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
