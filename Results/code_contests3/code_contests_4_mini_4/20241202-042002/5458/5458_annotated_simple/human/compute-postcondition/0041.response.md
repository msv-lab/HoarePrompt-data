According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, since `j` is incremented, it must be noted that `j` is currently at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to 2. Therefore, `j` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is updated (exact value not specified), `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**
