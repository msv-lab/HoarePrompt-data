The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables directly; rather, it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no indication of a loop or further context provided, the existing values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2; `dp[0][4][2]` is set to the value of `dp[0][3][2] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
