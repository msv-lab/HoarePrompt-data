The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since the initial state specifies that `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and since `N`, `s`, `k`, and the `dp` structure are not altered directly by the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged except for the loop's control flow.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
