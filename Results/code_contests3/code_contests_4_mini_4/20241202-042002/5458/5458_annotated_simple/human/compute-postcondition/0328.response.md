Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is set to `N`, `i` is not equal to 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and the loop has executed at least once with `s` greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the else part does not execute.***
