The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, `i` is 1 or 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
