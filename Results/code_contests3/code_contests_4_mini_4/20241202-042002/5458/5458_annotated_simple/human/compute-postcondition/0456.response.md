The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, `i` is `0`, `j` is `3`, and `k` is `1`. 

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` results in `(0 + 1) & 1` which is `1 & 1` that equals `1`.
- `j + 1` results in `3 + 1` which equals `4`.
- `k` remains `1`.

Hence, the assignment is made to `dp[1][4][1] = 1`.

The values of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.**
