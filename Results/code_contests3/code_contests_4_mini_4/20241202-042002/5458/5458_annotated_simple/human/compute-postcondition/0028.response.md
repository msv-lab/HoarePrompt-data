The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since the condition states that `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is `s + 1`, we can proceed with the assignment. The state of the other variables, including `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
