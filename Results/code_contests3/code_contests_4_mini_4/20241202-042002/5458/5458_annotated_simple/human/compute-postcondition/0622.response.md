According to the code, since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is `N`, `i` is `N^2 - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 7, and the output is `dp[n`**
