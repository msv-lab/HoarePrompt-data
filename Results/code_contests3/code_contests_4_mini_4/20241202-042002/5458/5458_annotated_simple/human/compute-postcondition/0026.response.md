The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
