According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which starts at 1 and iterates up to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum valid value (which is less than or equal to `s`), and since `s` is at least 7, `k` can take on values from 1 to 7. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be 2. 

Since `s` is at least 7, to execute the loop again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which currently holds true.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 7, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
