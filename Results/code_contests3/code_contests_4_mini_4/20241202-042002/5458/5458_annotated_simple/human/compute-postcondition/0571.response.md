The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
