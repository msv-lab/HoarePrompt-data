The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the loop will continue executing as long as the loop condition remains true. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time; `k` is 3; and an element of the `dp` array is updated, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
