Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 7, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.***
