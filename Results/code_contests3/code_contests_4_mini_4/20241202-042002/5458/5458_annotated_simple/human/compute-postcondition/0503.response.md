The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change because we just skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 5; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][5]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][5]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
