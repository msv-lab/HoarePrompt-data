According to the code, the `for` loop can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 5. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 6 (since the range is from 1 to `s + 1`), and `k` should increase by 1 to 6.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 6, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 6**
