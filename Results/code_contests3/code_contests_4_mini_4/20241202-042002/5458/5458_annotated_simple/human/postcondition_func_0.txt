The function processes multiple datasets of integers N, M, and S, where N is constrained between 1 and 7, M is a positive integer up to 2000, and S is a positive integer up to 3000. It continues processing until a dataset with N, M, and S all equal to 0 is encountered. For each valid dataset, it performs a dynamic programming calculation and prints the result derived from a 3D list `dp`, which represents computed values based on the input. The function does not return any values; instead, it outputs results directly to the console.
