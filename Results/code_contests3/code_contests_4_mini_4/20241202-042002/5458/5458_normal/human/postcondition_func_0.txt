The function processes multiple datasets consisting of three integers N, M, and S. It calculates a specific dynamic programming value based on these integers and prints the result for each dataset. The function continues to process datasets until all three integers are zero, at which point it terminates. The expected ranges for N, M, and S are 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The outputs are computed using a dynamic programming table, and results are taken modulo 100000. The function does not return any values; rather, it prints the results directly.
