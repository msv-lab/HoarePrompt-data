According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
