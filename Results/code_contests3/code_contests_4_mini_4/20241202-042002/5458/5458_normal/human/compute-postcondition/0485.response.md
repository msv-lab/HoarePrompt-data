According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was last set to 1 (the starting point of the loop), and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. 

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp` is updated, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, and `j` is 2.**
