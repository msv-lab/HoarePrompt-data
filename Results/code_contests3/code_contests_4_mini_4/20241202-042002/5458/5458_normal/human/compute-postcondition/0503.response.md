The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration without changing the values of any variables. Since no variables are altered and we are merely continuing the loop, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s`; `j` is 2 or greater; `s` is at least 1; `i` is equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
