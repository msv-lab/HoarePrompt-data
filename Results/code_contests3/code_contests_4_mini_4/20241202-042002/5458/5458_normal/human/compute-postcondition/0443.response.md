The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the multidimensional array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given as 2, 1, and 4 respectively.

First, we calculate the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which results in `1` (in binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, so `11 & 01` is `01`).
- `j + 1` evaluates to `2` (since `j` is `1`).
- `k` remains `4`.

Thus, the assignment translates to `dp[1][2][4] = 1`.

The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the assignment modifies the `dp` array at the specified index. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 4, and `dp[1][2][4]` is assigned the value 1.**
