Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][2][2]` is updated based on the value from `dp[0][1][1]`, while the other variables remain unaffected.***
