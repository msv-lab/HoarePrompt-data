Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.***
