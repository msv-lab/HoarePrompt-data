Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 0, `k` is 2, and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][2 - j] % mod` to it.***
