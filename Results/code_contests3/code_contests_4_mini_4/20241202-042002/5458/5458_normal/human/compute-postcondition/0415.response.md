Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7 and `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, an assignment is performed to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` based on unspecified conditions. If `j` is less than 3, no action is taken. If `i` is 0 and `j` is not greater than 3, the values of the variables do not change. If `j` is greater than 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
