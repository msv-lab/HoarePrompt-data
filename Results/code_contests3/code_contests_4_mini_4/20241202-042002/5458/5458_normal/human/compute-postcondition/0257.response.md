According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating over the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 2. This means that the loop is currently executing for `k = 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` will increase by 1. Therefore, after the current iteration, `k` will be 2.

Since `s` is at least 2, the range for `k` goes from 1 to at least 3 (since `s + 1` is at least 3), allowing for another iteration with `k` equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (which is at least 2)**
