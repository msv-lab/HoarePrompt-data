According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `s`; `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`; `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
