Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `j` is equal to `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the assignment for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we proceed to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
