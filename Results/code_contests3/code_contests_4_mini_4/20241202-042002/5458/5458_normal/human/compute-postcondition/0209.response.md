According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n ** 2`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, meaning that `n` can be either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Given that `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is `s + 1`, we have no direct impact on the loop's execution but they are part of the overall program state.

Since `i` has been incremented in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `n ** 2`. If the loop has executed `i` times, it means that after the last iteration `i` is now equal to the number of iterations executed.

To determine a valid state for the next iteration, we need to consider that `i` will increase by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the current value of `i` must be less than `n ** 2 - 1` to allow for one more iteration.

Thus, if `i` is currently `n ** 2 - 1`, for the loop to execute an additional time, we need `n` to be such that `n ** 2` is greater than `i + 1`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer between 2 and 7, at the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Hence, the next state will be:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `N ** 2 - 1`**
