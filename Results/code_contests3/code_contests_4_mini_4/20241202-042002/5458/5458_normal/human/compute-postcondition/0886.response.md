According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and since `k` starts from 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. 

Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute a fourth time as long as `s` is at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4, `j` is 2; `k` is 4**
