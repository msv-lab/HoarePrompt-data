Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2; if `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
