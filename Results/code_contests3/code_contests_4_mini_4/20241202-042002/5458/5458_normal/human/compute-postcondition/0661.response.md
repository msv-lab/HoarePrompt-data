According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Given the information that `j` is at least 1, the next value for `j` will be at least 2. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from `j = 1` and continues up to `m`. 

Thus, we must state that `j` is now 2, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2.**
