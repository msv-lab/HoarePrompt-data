Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `k` is `s`, `dp` is updated based on the loop's conditions, `m` is adjusted accordingly, and `j` is `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip the rest of the current loop iteration, while `i` remains not equal to 0.***
