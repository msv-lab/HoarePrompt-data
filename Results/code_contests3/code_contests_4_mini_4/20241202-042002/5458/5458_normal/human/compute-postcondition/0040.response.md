Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1; `m` is at least 1; `j` is at least 1; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for the first iteration, and subsequent updates depend on the values of `dp` based on conditions; if `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly based on the previous states.**
