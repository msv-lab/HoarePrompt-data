The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 1; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
