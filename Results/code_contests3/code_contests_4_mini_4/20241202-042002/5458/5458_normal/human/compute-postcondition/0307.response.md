Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp` is updated based on the operation but specific values cannot be determined, while `s` is at least 3 and `m` is greater than or equal to 3.***
