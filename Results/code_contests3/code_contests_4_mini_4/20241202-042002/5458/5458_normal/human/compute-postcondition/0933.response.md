The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes multiple datasets where each dataset consists of three integers: `N`, `M`, and `S`. The constraints for these integers are as follows: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The function terminates input processing when it encounters a dataset where `N`, `M`, and `S` are all equal to 0. 

The output of the function is determined based on the valid datasets provided before the termination condition. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to process multiple datasets of integers and terminate upon encountering the specified termination condition. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers N, M, and S, terminating when N, M, and S are all 0.**
