Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and if `i` is 0, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][3][-2] % mod`.***
