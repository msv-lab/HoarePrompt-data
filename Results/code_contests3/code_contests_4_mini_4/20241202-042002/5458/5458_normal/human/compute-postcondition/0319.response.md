According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to run at least once, `s` must be at least 1. The other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `m` do not directly affect the execution of the `for` loop in this case. 

At the start of the loop, `k` will take its first value of 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` is set accordingly. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1**
