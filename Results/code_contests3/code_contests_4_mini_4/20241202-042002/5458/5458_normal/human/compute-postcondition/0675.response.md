According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2, which means that `k` can be incremented by 1 to execute the loop one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 3, and `s` must still be at least 3.

State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
