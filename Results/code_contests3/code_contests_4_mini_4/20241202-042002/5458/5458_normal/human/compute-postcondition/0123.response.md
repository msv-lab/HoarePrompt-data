According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is currently at its last value of 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, becoming 2. Additionally, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
