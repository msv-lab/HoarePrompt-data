The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
