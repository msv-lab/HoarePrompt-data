Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, no changes occur in the specified block.***
