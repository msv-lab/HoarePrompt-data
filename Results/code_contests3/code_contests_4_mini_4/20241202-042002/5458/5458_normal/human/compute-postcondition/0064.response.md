According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, since the loop iterates from `1` to `s`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, but since the loop condition is for `k` to be less than or equal to `s`, it means that it can no longer execute again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be adjusted to be at least `s + 1`, and `k` must be `s + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least `s + 1`, and `k` is `s + 1`**.
