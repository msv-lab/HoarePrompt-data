Since the loop is structured as `while 1`, it is an infinite loop that will execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute, as it is guaranteed to run at least once.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000.**
