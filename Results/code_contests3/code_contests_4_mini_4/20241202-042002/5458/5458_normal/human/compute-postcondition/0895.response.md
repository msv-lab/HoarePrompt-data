Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is equal to `s`. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` reflects the computed values depending on the iterations over `k`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1. The final state of the `dp` array will depend on the values calculated through all iterations of `k`.**
