Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, then `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2 with `j` as 2, `k` as 1, `s` at least 1, and `m` at least 2, then `dp[1][3][1]` remains unchanged.***
