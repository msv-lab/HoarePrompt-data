The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, which cannot execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and the loop cannot execute again as we continue to the next iteration.
