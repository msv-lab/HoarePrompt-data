The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `i` is equal to `n` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
