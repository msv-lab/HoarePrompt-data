The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 5, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] while continuing to the next iteration.
