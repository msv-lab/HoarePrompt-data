In the given code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` indicates that the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is being assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Here, `i` is initially 0, so `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in 1, meaning that `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is being updated. 

The value of `j` is not specified but we know that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, which is 1. Hence, `j + 1` will be at least 2. 

The value of `dp[1][j][k]` is also not specified directly, but it is implied that the value from `dp[1][j][1]` is being copied to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

Therefore, the states of the variables affected in this operation are:

- `i` remains 0.
- `j` is at least 1 (since it must be greater than or equal to `k`).
- `k` is 1.
- `dp[1][j + 1][1]` now holds the value of `dp[1][j][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is 1; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is now assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1]`.**
