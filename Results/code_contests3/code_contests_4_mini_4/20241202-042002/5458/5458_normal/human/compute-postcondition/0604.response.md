The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceeds to the next iteration. In this case, it does not alter the values of the variables `N`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `s`, or `dp`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values remain unchanged and indicates that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `dp[0][5][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
