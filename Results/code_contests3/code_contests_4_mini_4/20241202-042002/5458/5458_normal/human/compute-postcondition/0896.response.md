According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3 in the next iteration. The value of `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 3; `k` is equal to `s`; for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 3.**
