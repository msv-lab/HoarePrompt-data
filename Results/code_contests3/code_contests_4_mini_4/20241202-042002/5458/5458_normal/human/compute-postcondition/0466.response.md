According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s` (because the loop runs from 1 to `s`).

Given that `s` is at least 1, if we want the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be increased by at least 1 so that the upper limit of the loop (`s`) becomes greater than the current `k`. 

Assuming `s` is currently equal to its value at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase `k` by 1 to allow the loop to execute again. Thus, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least 2.**
