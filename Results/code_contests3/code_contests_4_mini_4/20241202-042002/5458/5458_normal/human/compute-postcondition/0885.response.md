Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 2; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the `dp` array is updated using `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3] += dp[i & 1][2][1] % mod.***
