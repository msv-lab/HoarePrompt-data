Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is 3; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; if `i` is 0, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1; if `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][3][-2] % mod; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
