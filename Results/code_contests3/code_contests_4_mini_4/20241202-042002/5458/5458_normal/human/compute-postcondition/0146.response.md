The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The specific impact of this code requires evaluating `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and using `k` for indexing.

- `i` is initially `0`, so `i + 1` becomes `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
- `j` is initially `2`, so `j + 1` becomes `3`.
- `k` is initially `1`.

Thus, the statement assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[1][3][1]`.

Since we do not have the values of `dp` before the assignment, we cannot report any specific changes to its other elements.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made by the assignment operation without affecting other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is 0; `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
