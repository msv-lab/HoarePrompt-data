Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
