The code snippet `continue` does not affect the values of any variables and simply skips to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
