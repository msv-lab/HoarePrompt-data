The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since it is not specified what loop we're currently in, the execution does not change any variable values. The output state remains unchanged, but we acknowledge that we are skipping the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `k` is `s`, `dp` is updated based on the loop's conditions, `m` is adjusted accordingly, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
