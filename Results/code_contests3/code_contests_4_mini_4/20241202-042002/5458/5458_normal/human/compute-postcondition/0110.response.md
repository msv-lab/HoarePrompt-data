According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for `k` values ranging from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Given the current state:
- `N` is a positive integer between 2 and 7.
- `i` is 2.
- `m` is at least 1.
- `j` is 1.

The only variable that directly affects the execution of the loop is `s`. To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that `s` is at least 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1, and we can keep the other variables unchanged.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
