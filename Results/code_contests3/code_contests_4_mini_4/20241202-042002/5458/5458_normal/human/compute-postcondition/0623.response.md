The input line `n, m, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into components, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. The variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged at this point. 

Here, `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `i` is `N^2`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is `s + 1`. The values of `m` and `s` will change based on the input, and `n` will take the place of `N` after the input is processed.

Thus, the output state reflects the new values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, while `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are dependent on the input values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `N` â‰¤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers.**
