According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` remains less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4 and `s` is at least 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1.

Since `k` is currently 4, it will be updated to 5 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 5.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 5; `j` is 3; `k` is 5; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is equal to 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 5.**
