The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
