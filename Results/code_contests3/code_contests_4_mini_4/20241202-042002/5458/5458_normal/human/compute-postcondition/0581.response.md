Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `s`; `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[0][j][3]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
