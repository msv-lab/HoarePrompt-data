The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `s`; `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`; `k` is 3; `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[0][j][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
