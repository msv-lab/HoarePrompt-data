The code snippet updates a multidimensional array `dp`, specifically at the index corresponding to the next value of `i` (which is `i + 1 & 1`), the value of `j + 1`, and the value of `k`. The new value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is taken from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

The impact of the code on the program is focused on the array `dp`, and the indices used are influenced by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `j` is 3
- `k` is 3
- Since `j` is greater than `k`, this condition holds true.

To evaluate `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, we note:
- `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` or `0` depending on whether `i` is odd or even.
- `j + 1` becomes `4` (since `j` is `3`).
- `k` remains `3`.

Therefore, after executing the statement, we can summarize that the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]`.**
