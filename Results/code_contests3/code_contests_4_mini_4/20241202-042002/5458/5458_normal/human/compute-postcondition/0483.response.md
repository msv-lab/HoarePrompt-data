Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement, while unspecified values of `i`, `j`, and `mod` affect the operation on `dp`.***
