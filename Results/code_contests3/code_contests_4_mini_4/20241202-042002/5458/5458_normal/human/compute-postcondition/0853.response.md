According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Currently, `k` is 2, so for the loop to execute a third time, `k` will be 3. Given that `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `i` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (which is at least 3).**
