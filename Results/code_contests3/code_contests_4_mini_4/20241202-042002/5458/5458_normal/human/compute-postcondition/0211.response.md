According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means that `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `k` is currently set to `s + 1`, it will be adjusted to 1, the first value in the range when the loop executes for the first time. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1. Since `N` is already a positive integer within the specified range, it does not need adjustment. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be at least 1**
