The values of the variables do not change but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
