Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `N`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
