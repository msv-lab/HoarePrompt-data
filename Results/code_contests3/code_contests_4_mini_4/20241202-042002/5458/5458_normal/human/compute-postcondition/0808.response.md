Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is reset to 1; `k` is 1; if `i` is 0, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, while the initial states of the other variables remain unaffected.***
