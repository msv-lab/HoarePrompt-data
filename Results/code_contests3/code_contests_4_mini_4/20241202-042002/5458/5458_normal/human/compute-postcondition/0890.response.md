The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement affects the flow of control by skipping the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; `j` is 3; `k` is 4 and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
