According to the code, this is a `while 1` loop, which means it is an infinite loop that will continue to execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no condition that would prevent the loop from executing again. As a result, we do not need to make any adjustments to the program state.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; and the output is `dp[n`**
