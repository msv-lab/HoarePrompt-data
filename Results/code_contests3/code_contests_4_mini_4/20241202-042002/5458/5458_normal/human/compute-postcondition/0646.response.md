The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
