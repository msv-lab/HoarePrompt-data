The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of a loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
