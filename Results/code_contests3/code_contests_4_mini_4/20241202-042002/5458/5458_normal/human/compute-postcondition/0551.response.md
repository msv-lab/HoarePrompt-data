Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `2 ≤ N ≤ 7`, `i` is `0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `2`, and `k` is `2`. If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned `1`. If `i` is not `0`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
