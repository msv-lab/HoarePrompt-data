The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed, which causes a skip to the next iteration of the loop that `continue` is located in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `k` must be 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
