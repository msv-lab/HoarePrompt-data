Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the operation intended to set `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` is executed. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][2][0] % mod`.***
