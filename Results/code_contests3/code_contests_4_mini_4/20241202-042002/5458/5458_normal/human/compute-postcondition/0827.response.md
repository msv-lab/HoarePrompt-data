Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is incremented to `s + 1`; `k` is equal to `s`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on the conditions evaluated, resulting in the final values of the dp array reflecting the calculations based on the iterations performed, with `dp` properly updated according to the logic given in the loop.**
