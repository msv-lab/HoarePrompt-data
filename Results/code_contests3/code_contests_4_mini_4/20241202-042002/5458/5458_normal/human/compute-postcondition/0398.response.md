According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` has a value of 1 (since the loop starts at 1). For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be 2. 

Additionally, we need to ensure that `s` is such that it allows `k` to be less than or equal to `s`. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, we assume `s` is also within a reasonable range, likely less than or equal to 7. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
