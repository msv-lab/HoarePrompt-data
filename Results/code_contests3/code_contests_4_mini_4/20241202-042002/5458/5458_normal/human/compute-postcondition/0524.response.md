The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is initially `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`.
2. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1` (bitwise AND operation), so we access `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.
3. `j` is `3`, hence `j + 1` equals `4`.
4. `k` is `3`, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the assignment `dp[1][4][3] = 1` sets the value of that specific index in the `dp` array to `1`. The previous values of `N`, `m`, `s`, and any other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.**
