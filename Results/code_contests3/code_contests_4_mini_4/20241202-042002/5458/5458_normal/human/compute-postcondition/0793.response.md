Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `j` is equal to `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` takes the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop will not execute again as `k` is now outside the range.***
