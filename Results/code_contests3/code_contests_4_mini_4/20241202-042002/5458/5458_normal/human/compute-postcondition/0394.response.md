Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `m` is greater than `j + 1`, and `k` is in the range 1 to `s` (inclusive). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
