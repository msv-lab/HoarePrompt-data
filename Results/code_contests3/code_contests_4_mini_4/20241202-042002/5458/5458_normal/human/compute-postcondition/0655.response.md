The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the current block. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and a value has been assigned to `dp[1][2][3]` from `dp[1][1][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
