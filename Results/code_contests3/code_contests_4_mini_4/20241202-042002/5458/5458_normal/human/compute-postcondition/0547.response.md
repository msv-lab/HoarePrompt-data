The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is executed. Therefore, the output state will reflect that no values have changed. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.**
