The values of the variables do not change but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, moving on to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 4, and `dp[1][2][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][4]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
