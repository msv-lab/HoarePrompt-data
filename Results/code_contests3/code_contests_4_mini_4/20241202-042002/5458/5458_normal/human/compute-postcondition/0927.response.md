Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is set to 4, `k` remains 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, then `j` is 4, `k` is 3, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop.***
