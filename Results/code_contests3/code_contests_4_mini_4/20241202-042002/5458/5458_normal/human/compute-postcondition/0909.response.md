Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 3, and if `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
