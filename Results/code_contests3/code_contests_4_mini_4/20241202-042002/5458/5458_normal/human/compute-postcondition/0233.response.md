According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, which means `k` will be 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, so `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3.**
