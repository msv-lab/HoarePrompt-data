Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7 and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, while `k` remains 3.***
