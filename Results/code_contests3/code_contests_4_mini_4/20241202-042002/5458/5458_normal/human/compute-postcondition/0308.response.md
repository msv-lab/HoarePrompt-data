Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is `s`, `s` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and if `i` is 0, then `dp[1][4][s]` is assigned the value 1 for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, utilizing the previous values in the array based on the loop logic.**
