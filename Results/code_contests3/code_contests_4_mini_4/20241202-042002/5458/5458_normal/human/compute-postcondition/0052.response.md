Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is less than `m`, `s` is at least `N` and at least 1, `k` is `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
