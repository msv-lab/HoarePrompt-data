The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
