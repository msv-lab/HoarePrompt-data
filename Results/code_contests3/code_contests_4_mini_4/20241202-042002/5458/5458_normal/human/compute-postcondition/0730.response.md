According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. With the given initial state, `N` being a positive integer does not directly affect the loop execution but `i` is currently 2 which does not influence the loop either. 

To ensure the loop executes, `s` must be at least 1. The variable `k` will start from 1. Therefore, the state should reflect that `s` is at least 1 and `k` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be at least 1, `k` is 1**
