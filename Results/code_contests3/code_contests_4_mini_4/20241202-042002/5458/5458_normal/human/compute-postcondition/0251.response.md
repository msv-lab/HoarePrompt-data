Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
