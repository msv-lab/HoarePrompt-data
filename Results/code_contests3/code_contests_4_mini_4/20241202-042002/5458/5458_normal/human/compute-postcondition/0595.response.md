The code `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1, `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value from `dp[0][4][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
