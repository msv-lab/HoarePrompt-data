According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2. Since `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute the next time, `k` will be 2, and `s` must still be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3.**
