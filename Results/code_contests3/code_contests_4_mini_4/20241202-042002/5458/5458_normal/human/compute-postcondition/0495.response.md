Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp` is updated, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
