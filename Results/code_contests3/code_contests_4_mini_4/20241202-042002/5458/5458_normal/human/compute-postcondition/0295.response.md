Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is 3; `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1 or updated based on conditions; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
