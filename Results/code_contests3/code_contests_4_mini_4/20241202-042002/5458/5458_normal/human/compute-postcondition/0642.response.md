According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `k` and the variable `s`. Since `k` starts at 1 and the loop continues while `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, we can conclude that `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2**
