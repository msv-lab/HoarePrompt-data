Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. In the else case, the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
