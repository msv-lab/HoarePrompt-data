Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `s`; `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
