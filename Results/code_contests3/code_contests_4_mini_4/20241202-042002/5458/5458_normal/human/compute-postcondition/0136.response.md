The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the current iteration of the loop, allowing the loop to proceed to the next iteration. The states of `N`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a third time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
