The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
