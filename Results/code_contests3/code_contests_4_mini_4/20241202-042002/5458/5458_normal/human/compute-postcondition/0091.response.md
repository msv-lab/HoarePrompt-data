The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`, with the indices affected by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` effectively computes `i + 1` and then applies a bitwise AND with 1. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` becomes 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1. Thus, the first index becomes 1.
2. The second index `j + 1` has `j` as 1, so `j + 1` becomes 2.
3. The third index remains as `k`, which is 2.

Now we evaluate the right-hand side of the assignment:

- The left-hand side accesses `dp[1][2][2]`.
- The right-hand side accesses `dp[1][1][2]`.

Therefore, the assignment updates `dp[1][2][2]` with the value from `dp[1][1][2]`.

The values of `N`, `s`, and other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is updated to `dp[1][1][2]`.**
