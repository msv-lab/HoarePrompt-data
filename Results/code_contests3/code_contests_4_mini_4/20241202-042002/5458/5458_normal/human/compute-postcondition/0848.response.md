The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `dp` is modified at indices [i + 1 & 1][2][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
