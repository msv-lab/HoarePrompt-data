Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; the output is `dp[N^2 & 1][M + 1][S] % mod`; the loop continues until the input values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero.**
