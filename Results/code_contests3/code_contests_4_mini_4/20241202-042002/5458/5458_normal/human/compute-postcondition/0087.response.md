Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, and `k` is 1, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is reset to 1 if `j` is greater than `k`; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is 1; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
