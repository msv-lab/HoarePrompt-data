According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2, and the condition `k ≤ s` must still hold. Given that `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
