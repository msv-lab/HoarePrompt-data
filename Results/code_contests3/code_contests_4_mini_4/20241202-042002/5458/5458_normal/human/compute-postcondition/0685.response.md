The variable `dp` is a 3-dimensional array, and the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is calculated based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- The value of `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is 0 or not. 
- `j + 1` will result in 3, since `j` is 2.
- `k` remains 4.

Since `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][4]` is assigned the value 1, the output state will reflect that a specific element in the `dp` array has been set to 1 while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][4]` is set to 1.**
