The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`, `k` is at least 1, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
