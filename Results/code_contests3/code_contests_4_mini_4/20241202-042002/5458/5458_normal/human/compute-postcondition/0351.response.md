According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the maximum value `m`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 and continues while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

The variable `m` is not explicitly stated as being modified within the loop. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, we can assume that `m` is also within a reasonable range, but we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2 and `j` will be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `k` is `s + 1`; for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
