The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement will skip the current iteration of the loop that `i` is part of. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is 1; `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
