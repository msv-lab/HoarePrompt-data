Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][2][1] % mod`.***
