The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
