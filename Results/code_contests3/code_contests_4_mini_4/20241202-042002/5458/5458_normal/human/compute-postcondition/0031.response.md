According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2 and `s` is at least 2 (since `s` is at least 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Furthermore, since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1; `m` is at least 1; `j` is at least 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3**
