Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. Since `j` (1) is less than `k` (3), the condition `j >= k` is false, and therefore the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not assigned any value. The program does not make any changes in this case.***
