The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is not greater than `k` (1 is not greater than 1), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
