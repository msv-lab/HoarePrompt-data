Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is updated to `j + s` where `s` is the final value of `s`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions and previous values of `dp`. If the loop does not execute, `j` remains unchanged and `dp` retains its initial state.**
