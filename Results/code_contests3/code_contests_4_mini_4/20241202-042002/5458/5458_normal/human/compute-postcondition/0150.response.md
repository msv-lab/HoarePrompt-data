The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves accessing and assigning values in a multidimensional list or array `dp`. 

1. The left side of the assignment references `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`. Since `i` is not equal to `0`, `i` must be at least `1`, making `i + 1` at least `2`. The result of `i + 1 & 1` will depend on whether `i` is odd or even:
   - If `i` is odd, `i + 1` is even, resulting in `0`.
   - If `i` is even, `i + 1` is odd, resulting in `1`.

3. The variable `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` results in `3`.
4. The variable `k` is `1`, which remains unchanged.

Thus, depending on whether `i` is odd or even, we can derive two possible states.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `k` is 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
