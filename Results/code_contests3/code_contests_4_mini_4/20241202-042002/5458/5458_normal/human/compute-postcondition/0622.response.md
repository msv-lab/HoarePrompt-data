According to the code, since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there are no adjustments needed to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; result is `dp[N^2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod**.
