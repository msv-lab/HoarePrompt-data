According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least `N`, where `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3, `k` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3**
