The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and the assignment dp[0][j + 1][k] = dp[0][j][k] has been made, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
