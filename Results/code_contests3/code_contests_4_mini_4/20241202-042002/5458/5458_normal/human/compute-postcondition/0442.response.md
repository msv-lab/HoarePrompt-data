According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is structured to run for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. 

Given that `s` must be at least `k` for the loop to run, and since `k` is currently at least 3, `s` must be at least 3 as well, allowing the next value of `k` to be 4. 

So, at the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at least 3, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be increased to 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `k` is 4 for the loop to execute a second time, and `s` must be at least 4.**
