The code snippet `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed with the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variable states or values, the output state reflects that we are continuing within the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `m` is at least 2; `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
