Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is 2 or greater, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
