Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 5; `j` is 3; `k` is 5; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][5]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][5]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3][2] % mod` to its current value.***
