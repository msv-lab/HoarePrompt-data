According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again if `k` is incremented. 

After the last iteration, `k` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be increased to 2. Since `s` is at least 2, this condition is satisfied.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
