According to the code, the loop will execute again for the next value of `k` if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2, meaning the loop can execute again as long as `k` does not exceed `s`. 

In the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 3. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3, `k` is 3**
