According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop executes for values of `k` in the range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its maximum value of `s`. Since the loop is structured to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the next iteration will not occur because `k` would be incremented beyond `s`.

To allow for the loop to execute one more time, we must consider that `k` needs to be less than `s`. Therefore, if `k` is currently `s`, the next state should reflect `k` being incremented to `s + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. 

Thus, the state must be adjusted to indicate that the loop cannot execute again unless `s` is increased.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute again `s` must be greater than `s`.**
