The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `N`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is the next integer greater than the current value; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
