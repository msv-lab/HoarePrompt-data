To understand how the states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must first analyze the provided information about the variables.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over the variable `j`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `m`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` in the range specified.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7.
   - `s` is at least 3.
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `k` is equal to `s`.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.

3. **Next Iteration Condition**: 
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to increment. 
   - Since `j` starts at 1, the next value for `j` would be 2.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` remains less than or equal to `m`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: 
   - Currently, `j` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `j` will become 2.
   - The condition `j` must still be greater than or equal to `k` needs to be satisfied for the body of the loop to execute, along with other conditions regarding `i` and `k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, after the next iteration, `j` will increment to 2.
   - The other variables remain unchanged, assuming they are not modified in the loop body.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect the increment of `j` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is equal to `n`.**
