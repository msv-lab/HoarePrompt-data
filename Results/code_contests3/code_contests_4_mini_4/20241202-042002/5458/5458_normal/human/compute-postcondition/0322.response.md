In the given code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate the expression `i + 1` first, where `i` is initially `0`. Thus, `i + 1` results in `1`. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in `1`. So, the first index of `dp` becomes `1`.

The second index `j + 1` will evaluate to `j + 1`, where `j` is initially `1`, resulting in `2`. The third index is simply `k`, which is `1`.

Thus, the complete assignment becomes `dp[1][2][1] = 1`. The values of other variables (`N`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
