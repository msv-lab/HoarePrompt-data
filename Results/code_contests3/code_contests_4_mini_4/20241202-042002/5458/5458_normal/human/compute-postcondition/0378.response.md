The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[1][j][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
