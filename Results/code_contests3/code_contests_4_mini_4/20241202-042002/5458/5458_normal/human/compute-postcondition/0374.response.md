According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. The loop can continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` needs to be 3 and it must satisfy the condition `k ≤ s`. Thus, we also need to ensure that `s` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
