Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` is updated with a value derived from `dp[i & 1][2][k - 2] % mod.***
