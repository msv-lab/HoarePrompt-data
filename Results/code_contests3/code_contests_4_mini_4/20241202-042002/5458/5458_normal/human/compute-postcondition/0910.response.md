According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Consequently, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2 (which it is, since `s` is at least 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 3, and if `i` is equal to 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
