Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on an invalid index access `dp[i & 1][3][-1] % mod`.***
