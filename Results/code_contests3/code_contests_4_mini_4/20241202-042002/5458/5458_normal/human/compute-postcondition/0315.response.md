Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
