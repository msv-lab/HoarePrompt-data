The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 4; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3; `dp[0][5][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][3]` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
