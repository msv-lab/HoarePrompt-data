Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the variables. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][1] % mod.`***
