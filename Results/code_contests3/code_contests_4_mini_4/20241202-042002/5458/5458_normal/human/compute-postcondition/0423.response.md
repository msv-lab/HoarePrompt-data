The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the array `dp` at the index specified by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

- The value of `i` is `2`, so `i + 1` is `3`. The expression `3 & 1` evaluates to `1`, because in binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, and the bitwise AND results in `01`, which is `1`.
- The value of `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` is `2`.
- The value of `k` is `s + 1`, where `s` is at least `1`, meaning `k` is at least `2`.

Thus, the assignment is effectively `dp[1][2][k] = 1`.

Since the output does not change the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, but rather modifies the array `dp`, the output state reflects the situation after the assignment has been made without providing specific values for `dp`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 2, and dp[1][2][k] is set to 1.**
