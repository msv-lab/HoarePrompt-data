According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n ** 2`. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, the maximum value of `n ** 2` is 49 when `N` is 7. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the last value it took, which must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute again.

Since `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `s` is at least 3, these states do not directly affect the loop iteration but may be relevant in the loop body.

After the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of `n ** 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment by 1, making it equal to `n ** 2`. Therefore, `N` must remain the same, and `i` should be incremented accordingly. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is equal to `n ** 2` for the loop to execute one more time.**
