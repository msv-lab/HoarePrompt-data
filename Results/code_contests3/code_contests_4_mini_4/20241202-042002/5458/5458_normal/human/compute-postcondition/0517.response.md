Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0 or 1, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the loop, where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is potentially set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or updated based on the previous values modulo `mod`.**
