The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` since `i` is `0`, resulting in `1 & 1` which is `1`. The variable `j` is already `2 or greater`, so `j + 1` will be at least `3`. The variable `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and since `s` is at least `1`, `k` is at least `2`. 

Thus, the specific indices being modified in the `dp` array are `dp[1][j + 1][k]`, where `j + 1 >= 3` and `k >= 2`. No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is 2 or greater, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
