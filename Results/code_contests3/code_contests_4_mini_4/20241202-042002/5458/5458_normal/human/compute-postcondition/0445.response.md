The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates `i + 1` and then performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`. Given that `i` is `2`, we have:

- `i + 1` is `3`, and `3 & 1` results in `1`.
- `j + 1` is `2`.

Thus, the assignment can be rewritten as:

`dp[1][2][k] = dp[1][1][k]`.

Since `k` is `4`, the expression accesses `dp[1][2][4]` and assigns it the value of `dp[1][1][4]`. 

The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, while the specific elements of the `dp` array are updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 4, and `dp[1][2][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][4]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 4, and `dp[1][2][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][4]`.**
