The line of code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `1`. 

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`.
- `k` is `1`.

So, we are actually assigning the value `1` to `dp[1][3][1]`. The other variables (`N`, `s`, `j`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value `1`.**
