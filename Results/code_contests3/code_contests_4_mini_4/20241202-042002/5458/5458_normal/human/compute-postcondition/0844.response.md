According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 3. This means that the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`.

Since `k` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 2. 

At this point, the conditions for the loop's execution next time will be that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 3, `k` being 2 satisfies this condition.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to `n`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3**
