The code `continue` does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1` where `s` is at least 1; `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
