The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves manipulating the indices `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which is `1` because in binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, leading to a bitwise AND result of `01` (which is `1`).
2. The index `j + 1` evaluates to `2` since `j` is `1`.
3. The variable `k` remains unchanged but is at least `3`.

Thus, the updated state of `dp` will be `dp[1][2][k] = 1`. 

No other variables in the initial state are affected, and the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is 1; `k` is at least 3; `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1.**
