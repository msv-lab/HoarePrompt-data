Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and `j` is equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` will also be greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
