The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned from the input split into three integers. The previous values of `N`, `i`, and `M`, `S` do not change, but new values are assigned to `n`, `m`, and `s` based on the input. The details of `N`, `i`, `M`, and `S` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers.**
