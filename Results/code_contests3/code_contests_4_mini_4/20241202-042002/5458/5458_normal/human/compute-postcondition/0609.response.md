According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute for values of `k` from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will be 3. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can still execute a second time if `s` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 4; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
