The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is 2 or greater; `s` is at least 1; `i` is equal to 0; and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
