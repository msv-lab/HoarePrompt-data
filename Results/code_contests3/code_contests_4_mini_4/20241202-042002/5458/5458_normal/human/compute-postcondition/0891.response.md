Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `j` is 3 and `k` is 4, causing the program to skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition does not hold and no action is taken.***
