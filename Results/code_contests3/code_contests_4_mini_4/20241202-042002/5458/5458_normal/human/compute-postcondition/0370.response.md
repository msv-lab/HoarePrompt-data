Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1 (if `j` is 3), and the current iteration of the most internal loop or if statement is skipped. Otherwise, if `j` is not greater than `k`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
