The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp` with the following indices:
- `i + 1 & 1`: This expression computes the value of `i + 1` which is `0 + 1 = 1`, then performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`. The result is `1 & 1 = 1`.
- `j + 1`: The value of `j` is `3`, so `j + 1` is `3 + 1 = 4`.
- `k`: The value of `k` is `3`.

Thus, the indices used to access the `dp` array are `[1][4][3]`. The assignment sets `dp[1][4][3]` to `1`.

The values of `N`, `s`, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.**
