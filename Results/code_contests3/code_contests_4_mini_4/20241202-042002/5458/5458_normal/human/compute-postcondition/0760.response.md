Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]`. Otherwise, if `i` is 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
