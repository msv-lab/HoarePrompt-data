Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in this block.***
