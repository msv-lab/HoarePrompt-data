The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `j` and `k` are currently 3 and 5, respectively. The other variables (`N` and `s`) do not change. The output state reflects the assignment operation without changing `N`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 5, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 5, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
