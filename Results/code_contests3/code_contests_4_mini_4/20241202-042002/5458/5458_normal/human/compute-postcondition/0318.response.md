According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer and the current values of `i` and `N` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `m` meets the requirement. The initial value of `j` will be 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1**
