The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the remainder of the current iteration in a loop. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3 and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
