Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7 and `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 3), an assignment is performed to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` based on unspecified conditions. If `j` is less than `k`, no action is taken.***
