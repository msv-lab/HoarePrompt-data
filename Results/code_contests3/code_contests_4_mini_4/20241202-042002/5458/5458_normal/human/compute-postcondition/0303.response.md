The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the values of `N`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are not affected, the output state remains as is. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
