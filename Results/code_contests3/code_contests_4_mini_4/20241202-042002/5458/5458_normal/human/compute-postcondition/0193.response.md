The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; `j` is 3; `k` is 4; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is equal to 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
