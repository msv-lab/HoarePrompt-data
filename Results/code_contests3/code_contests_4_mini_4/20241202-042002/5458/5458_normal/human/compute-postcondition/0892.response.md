Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `j` is 3 and `k` is 4, causing the program to skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop; if `j` is not greater than `k`, the condition does not hold and no action is taken; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
