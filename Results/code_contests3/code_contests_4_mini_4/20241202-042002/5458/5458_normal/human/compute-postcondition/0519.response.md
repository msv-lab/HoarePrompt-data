According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `N` is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq N \leq 7 \), the maximum value for \( n \) would be 7, leading to \( n^2 \) being a maximum of 49. Therefore, \( n^2 \) can range from 4 to 49.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will become 3. The loop will only execute again if \( i \) is still less than \( n^2 \).

Since \( i \) is 2 after the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, \( n^2 \) must be greater than 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n ** 2` must be greater than 3**.
