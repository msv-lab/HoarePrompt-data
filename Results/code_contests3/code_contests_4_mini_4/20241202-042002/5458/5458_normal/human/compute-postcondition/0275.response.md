Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `s` is at least 1, `dp` array is updated based on the conditions in the loop, with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` potentially set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or updated from previous values if `i` is not 0.**
