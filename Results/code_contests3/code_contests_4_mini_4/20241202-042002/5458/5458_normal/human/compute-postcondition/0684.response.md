According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The `for` loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1.

Since the loop starts with `k` as 1 and goes up to `s`, the next value of `k` will be 4. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 4. 

State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4.**
