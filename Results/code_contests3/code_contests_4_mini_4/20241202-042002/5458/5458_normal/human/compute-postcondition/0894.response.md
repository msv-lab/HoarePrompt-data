Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; `j` is 2 or 3; `k` is 4. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
