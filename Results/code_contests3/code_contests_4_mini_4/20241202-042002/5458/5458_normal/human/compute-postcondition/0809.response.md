According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. In the previous iteration, `k` is 1, which means the loop has executed once for `k = 1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 3, so `s + 1` is at least 4, allowing for further iterations. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be updated to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is reset to 1; `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` which is at least 3.**
