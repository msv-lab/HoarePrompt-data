The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 2, `s` must be at least 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
