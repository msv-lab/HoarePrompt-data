The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
