According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, and since the loop continues while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the next iteration will have `k` incremented by 1. Since `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will become `s + 1`, which is greater than `s`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3 for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be 4 (which is greater than `s`).**
