The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, but control flow is altered to skip the subsequent statements in the loop for the current iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be at least `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time; `k` is `s + 1` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
