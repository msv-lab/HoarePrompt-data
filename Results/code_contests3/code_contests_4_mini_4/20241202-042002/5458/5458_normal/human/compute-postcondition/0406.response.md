Postcondition: ***Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
