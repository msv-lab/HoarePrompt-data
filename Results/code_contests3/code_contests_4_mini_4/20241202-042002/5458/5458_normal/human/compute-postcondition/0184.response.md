The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves to the next iteration of the loop it is currently in. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is equal to 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is not equal to 0; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
