According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. The conditions for the loop to execute depend on the value of `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than `s` for the loop to execute again. Given that `s` is at least 3, the loop has executed for values of `k` starting from 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value which is `s`, and since the loop is defined to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, it needs to be incremented to `s + 1` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be 2 as it will increment from its current value to the next value, and `s` remains unchanged.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
