Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value `1`. There is no change in the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` in the else case, as there is no else part.***
