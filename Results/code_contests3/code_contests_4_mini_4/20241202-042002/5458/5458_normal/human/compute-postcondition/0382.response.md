Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
