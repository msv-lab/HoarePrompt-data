Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 1; `k` is equal to `s`; `i` is equal to `n`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1 for all k from 1 to s. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for all k from 1 to s. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous states, specifically using the values from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` for all k from 1 to s.**
