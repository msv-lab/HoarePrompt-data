The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves updating a value in a 3D list or array `dp`. The first index is calculated as `i + 1 & 1`, the second index as `j + 1`, and the third index as `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` becomes 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in 1.
- `j` is greater than or equal to 3, therefore `j + 1` will be at least 4.
- `k` is 3, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the indices used to access `dp` will be:
- The first index is 1,
- The second index is at least 4,
- The third index is 3.

The value at `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.**
