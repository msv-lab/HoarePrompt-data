The code `continue` affects the flow of control in loops. It does not change the values of any variables, but it will skip the current iteration of the loop in which it is executed, moving to the next iteration instead. Since the previous values of the variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects that no updates were made to the variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is reset to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue in the loop.**
