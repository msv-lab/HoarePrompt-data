Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[1][2][k]` is either set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or updated based on the values from `dp` arrays as specified in the loop code.**
