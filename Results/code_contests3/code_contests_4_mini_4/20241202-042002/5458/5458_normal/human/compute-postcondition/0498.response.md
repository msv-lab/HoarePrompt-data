Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at position [1][j + 1][k] to 1, `m` must be at least 2, `j` is 2 or greater, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
