The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1 (if `j` is 3), and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
