Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]` and the rest of the current iteration of the loop is skipped. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`.***
