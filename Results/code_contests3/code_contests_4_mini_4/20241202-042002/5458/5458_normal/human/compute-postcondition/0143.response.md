According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute `s` times, starting from `k = 1` to `k = s`. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2. Additionally, the variable `j` is already set to 2, and `N` is a positive integer between 2 and 7, but it does not affect the loop execution directly.

To ensure the loop executes at least twice, `s` needs to be at least 2. The variable `k` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
