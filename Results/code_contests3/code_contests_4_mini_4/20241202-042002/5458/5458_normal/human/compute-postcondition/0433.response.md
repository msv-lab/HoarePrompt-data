According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the range specified by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2, and the loop's range goes from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `k` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration, it will become at least 3 for the next iteration. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (to allow `k` to reach at least 3, given the loop's range).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3.**
