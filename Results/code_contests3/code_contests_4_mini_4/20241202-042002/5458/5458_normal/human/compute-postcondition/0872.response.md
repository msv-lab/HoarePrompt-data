The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Since the initial state indicates that the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, and the conditions for `j` and `i` suggest that the loop is still active, there are no changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is equal to `N`, `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is not greater than `k`; `dp` remains unchanged, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
