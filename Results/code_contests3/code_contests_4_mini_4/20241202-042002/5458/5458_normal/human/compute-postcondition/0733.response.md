The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing a three-dimensional array `dp`. The first index is calculated as `i + 1 & 1`, which needs to be evaluated first. 

Given that `i` is equal to 0 (as stated in the initial conditions), we calculate:
- `i + 1` equals `1`.
- Then, `1 & 1` results in `1` (bitwise AND operation).

Now we need to consider the second index, which is `j + 1`. Since `j` is stated to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 1, we can say that `j` is at least 1. Therefore, `j + 1` is at least `2`.

Now we have:
- The first index: `1`
- The second index: At least `2`
- The third index: `k`, which is `1`

Thus, the statement `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1` will assign the value `1` to the element in the `dp` array at indices `[1][j + 1][1]`. 

The values of `s`, `N`, and the exact value of `j` do not affect this assignment directly.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than or equal to `1`; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
