Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` is incremented to 2, `k` remains 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` remains 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition of the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
