The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `j` is 3; `k` is 1; `m` is at least 3; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; and an assignment was made in the `dp` array, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
