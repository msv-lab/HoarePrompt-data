Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
