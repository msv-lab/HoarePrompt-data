Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is 2 or greater, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
