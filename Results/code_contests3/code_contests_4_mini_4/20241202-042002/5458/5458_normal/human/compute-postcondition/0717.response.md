According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4, and since `s` is at least 7, the loop can execute again.

Since the loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`, after the last iteration where `k` was 4, it will increment `k` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `k` will now be 5.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state should reflect that `k` is now 5, while `s` remains at least 7.

State: **`N` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 5 for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
