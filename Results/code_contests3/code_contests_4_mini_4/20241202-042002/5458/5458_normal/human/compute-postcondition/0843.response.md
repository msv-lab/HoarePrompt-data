Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
