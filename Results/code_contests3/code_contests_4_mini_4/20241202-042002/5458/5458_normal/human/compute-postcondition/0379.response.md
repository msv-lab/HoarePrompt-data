Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value from `dp[1][j][3]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program does not perform any updates.***
