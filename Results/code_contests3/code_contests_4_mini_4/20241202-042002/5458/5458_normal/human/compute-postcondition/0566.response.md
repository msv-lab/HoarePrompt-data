Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is at least 1, and for the loop to execute the second time `s` must be at least 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[4][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[3][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
