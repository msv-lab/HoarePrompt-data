Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is updated with the value calculated from `dp[0][j][2] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
