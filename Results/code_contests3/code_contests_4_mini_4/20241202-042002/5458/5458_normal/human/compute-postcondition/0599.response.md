Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][5][1]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the operation attempted with invalid index `dp[1][4][-3]` does not change any values.***
