The code contains a `continue` statement, which does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program should skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
