The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific position in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indices used here depend on the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `k` is 3, which is known. The impact on the state will depend on the values of `i` and `j`, which are not specified in the initial state.

Since `N` is given to be between 2 and 7, and `k` is fixed at 3, we can deduce the following:

- `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1` depending on the parity of `i`. 
- `j + 1` will depend on the value of `j`, which is unknown.
- The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3] = 1` indicates that the value `1` is placed in the `dp` array at the coordinates determined by the computed indices.

However, since the exact values of `i` and `j` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact index in `dp`. Therefore, we conclude that the state of the variables may remain ambiguous in terms of specific numerical values but we can confirm that the value at the computed index in the `dp` array is set to `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1**.
