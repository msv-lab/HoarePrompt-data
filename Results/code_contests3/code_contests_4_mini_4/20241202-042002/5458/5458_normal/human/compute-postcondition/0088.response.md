According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates for values of `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. Additionally, since `s` is at least `N`, and `N` can be at most 7, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2 and `k` is 2.**
