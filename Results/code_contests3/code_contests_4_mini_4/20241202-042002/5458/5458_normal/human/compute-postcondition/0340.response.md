Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
