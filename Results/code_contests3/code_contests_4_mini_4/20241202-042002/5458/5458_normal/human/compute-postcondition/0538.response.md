The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, reflecting the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k] has been executed; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
