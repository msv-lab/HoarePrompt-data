Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1; `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
