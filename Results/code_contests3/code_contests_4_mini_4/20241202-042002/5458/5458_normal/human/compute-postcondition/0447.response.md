Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 4, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][4]`, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to the variables.***
