The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The other variables in the state are not affected directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the modulus operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
