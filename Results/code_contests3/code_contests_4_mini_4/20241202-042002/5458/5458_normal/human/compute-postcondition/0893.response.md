Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; `j` is 3 and `k` is 4, therefore we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
