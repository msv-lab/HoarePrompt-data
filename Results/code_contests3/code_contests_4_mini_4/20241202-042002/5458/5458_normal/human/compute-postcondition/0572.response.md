Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then the assignment `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is made equal to `dp[0][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
