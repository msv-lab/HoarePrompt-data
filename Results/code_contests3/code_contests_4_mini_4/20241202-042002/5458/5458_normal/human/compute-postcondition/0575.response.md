Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `s`; `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`; `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is updated with the value calculated from `dp[0][j][2] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
