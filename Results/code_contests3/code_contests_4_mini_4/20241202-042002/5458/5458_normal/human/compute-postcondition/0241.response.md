Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is either 1 or 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0, the program does not make any changes as `j` is less than `k`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `j` is updated to 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][2][1] % mod.***
