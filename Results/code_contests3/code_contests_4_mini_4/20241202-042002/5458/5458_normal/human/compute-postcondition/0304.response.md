Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `m` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, since there is no else part, the program simply does not perform any action.***
