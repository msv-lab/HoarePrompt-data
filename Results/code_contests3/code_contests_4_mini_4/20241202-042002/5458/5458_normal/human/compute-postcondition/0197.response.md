Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 4; `j` is 3; `k` is 4; `m` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][4]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][4][k] += dp[0][3][1] % mod`.***
