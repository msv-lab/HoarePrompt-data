Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `s`; `j + 1` is less than or equal to `m`; `k` is equal to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][s]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[4][j + 1][s]` is updated by adding `dp[3][j][s - j] % mod` to its current value. The final state of `dp` reflects all updates made during the loop iterations.**
