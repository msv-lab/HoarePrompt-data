The code `continue` instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is currently in and proceed to the next iteration. However, this does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged, but we note that we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
