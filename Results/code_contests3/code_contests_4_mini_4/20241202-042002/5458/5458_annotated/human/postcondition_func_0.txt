The function reads multiple sets of positive integers N, M, and S until all three are zero. It computes a value based on a dynamic programming approach using these inputs and outputs the result for each valid set of inputs. The function ensures that the computed value is taken modulo 100000 before printing. The exact nature of the computation involves filling a 2D list based on conditions involving the input values, but the overall logic and purpose of the computation are not explicitly detailed in the annotations.
