Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues and reasons why the program fails to meet the problem description:

1. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The main logic in the program uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid bingo cards. However, the state transitions and conditions used in the loops do not align with the constraints set forth in the problem description about how the bingo card should be constructed (ascending order in columns and increasing left to right).

2. **Initialization of DP Table**: The initialization of the `dp` table is not correctly set up. The current logic for setting the base case when `i == 0` does not clearly reflect the requirement of creating unique bingo cards that satisfy the conditions. The way the `dp` table is filled does not ensure valid entries for all potential configurations of the bingo card.

3. **Control Flow Issues**: The control flow in the nested loops may skip necessary computations or incorrectly increment values based on the logical conditions used. Specifically, it is not clear if the checks for the values in the bingo cards and their sums are implemented correctly.

4. **Modulo Operation**: While the output is taken modulo 100000 as required, the logic leading up to that output does not guarantee that the correct number of unique bingo cards is computed.

5. **Input Handling**: The input handling uses `raw_input()` and `xrange()`, which are not compatible with Python 3. This could lead to runtime errors if executed with Python 3, which is commonly used today.

Overall, the logic implemented in the program does not guarantee that it will produce the correct count of bingo cards that satisfy all the conditions outlined in the problem description. The approach is flawed in its implementation of the constraints required for the bingo cards, and thus it fails to meet the requirements of the problem accurately.
