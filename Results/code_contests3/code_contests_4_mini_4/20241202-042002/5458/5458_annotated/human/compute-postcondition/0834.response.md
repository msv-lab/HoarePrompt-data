The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` 2D list at the position specified by the computed indices. 

Let's break down the indices:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1.
- The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to 1 (bitwise AND), so the first index becomes 1.
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.

Thus, the indices for the `dp` list are `dp[1][3][k]`, where `k` is 2.

With this, we are setting `dp[1][3][2] = 1`.

Other variables and their values are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2; `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.**
