According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1.

At the start of the loop, the variable `k` will be set to 1, and it will increment until it reaches `s`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1 and `j` is \(k + 1\), `j` will be 2 when `k` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time after the current state, `s` must be incremented so that it can accommodate the next value of `k`. Thus, `s` should be at least 1, and `k` must be initialized to 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
