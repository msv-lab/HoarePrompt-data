According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `s` is at least 3, `s + 1` is at least 4. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which allows for one more iteration where `k` will be 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, and `i` is m + 2**
