Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][j][k] and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
