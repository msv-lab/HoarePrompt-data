According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to increase by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 3. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3.**
