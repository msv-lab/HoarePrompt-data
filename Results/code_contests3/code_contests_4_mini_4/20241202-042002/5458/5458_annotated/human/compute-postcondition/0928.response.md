Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, and `i` is equal to `m + 2`. The values of `dp` are updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`, with specific updates occurring when `i` is 0 and when `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
