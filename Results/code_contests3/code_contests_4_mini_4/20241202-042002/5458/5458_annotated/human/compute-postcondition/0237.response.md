The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
