The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][j][k]; `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
