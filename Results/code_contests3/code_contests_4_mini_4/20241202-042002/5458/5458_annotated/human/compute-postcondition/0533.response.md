Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); if `i` is 0 and `j` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` (which is 3), then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 3 and `j` is greater than 3, and `s` is at least 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
