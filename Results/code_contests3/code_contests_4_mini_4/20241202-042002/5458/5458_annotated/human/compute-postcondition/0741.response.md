Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by that same value. `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
