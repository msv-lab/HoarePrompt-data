Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[0][j][2 - j] % mod` to its current value.***
