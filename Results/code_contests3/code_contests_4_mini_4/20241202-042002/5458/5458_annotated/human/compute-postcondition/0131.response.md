Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated; otherwise, no changes to `dp` occur.***
