According to the code, since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there are no specific conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The program state remains the same as at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `i` is `n^2`; `j` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is at most `s`; the output is `dp[n`**
