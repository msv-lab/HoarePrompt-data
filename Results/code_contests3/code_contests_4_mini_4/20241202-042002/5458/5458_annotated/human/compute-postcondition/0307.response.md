Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1 for any valid `j`. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the `dp` list. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated at `dp[1][j + 1][k]`, and `i` is now 1.***
