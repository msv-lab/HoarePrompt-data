According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1 (since `xrange(1, s + 1)` will iterate for values starting from 1 up to and including `s`). 

Currently, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `j` is 2. However, we need to focus on the variable `s` to ensure the loop can execute once.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1. After the first execution, `k` will be 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be at least 1, `k` is 1**
