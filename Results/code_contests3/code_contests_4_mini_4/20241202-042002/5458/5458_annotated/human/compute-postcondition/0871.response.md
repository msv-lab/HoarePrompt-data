In the provided code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Let's analyze the variables:
- `i` is `m + 2`, where `m` is at least 2, so `i` is at least 4.
- `j` is 3, which is greater than `k` (which is 1).
- The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` since `i + 1` will be at least 5, and `5 & 1` is `1` (the least significant bit).

Now we can deduce the indices used in `dp`:
- The first index will be `1` (from `i + 1 & 1`).
- The second index will be `4` (from `j + 1`, which is `3 + 1`).
- The third index remains `k`, which is `1`.

Thus, we are setting:
`dp[1][4][1] = dp[1][3][1]`.

Since we have not modified the values of `dp`, we can only determine the relationship set by this assignment. The values of `dp` remain unaffected in this context.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] where i is at least 4 and j is 3.`
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] where i is at least 4 and j is 3.**
