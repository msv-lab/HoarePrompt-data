The variable `i` can be either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2`. The value of `k` is `s + 1`. The code assigns the value 1 to the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate as follows:
- If `i` is 0, then `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` is 1.
- If `i` is 1, then `i + 1` is 2, and `2 & 1` is 0.

Thus, depending on the value of `i`, the assignment will be to either `dp[1][j + 1][k]` (if `i` is 0) or `dp[0][j + 1][k]` (if `i` is 1).

Since `j` is `s + 2`, `j + 1` becomes `s + 3`, and `k` is `s + 1`. Therefore, the output will reflect the assignments to the `dp` structure.

Output State: **`dp[1][s + 3][s + 1]` is 1 if `i` is 0; `dp[0][s + 3][s + 1]` is 1 if `i` is 1; `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2`.**
