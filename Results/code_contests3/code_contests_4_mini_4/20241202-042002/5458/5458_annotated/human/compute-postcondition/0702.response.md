The code updates the value in the 2D list `dp` at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `i` is equal to 1, which makes `i + 1 & 1` equal to 0. The variable `j` is equal to `s + 2`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to the `dp` list.

The specific calculation for the indices would be:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0`
- `j + 1` evaluates to `s + 3`
- `k` evaluates to `s + 1`

Thus, the assignment can be stated as:
`dp[0][s + 3][s + 1] = dp[0][s + 2][s + 1]`.

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position [0][s + 3][s + 1] with the value from [0][s + 2][s + 1]; `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `j` is greater than `k`**.
