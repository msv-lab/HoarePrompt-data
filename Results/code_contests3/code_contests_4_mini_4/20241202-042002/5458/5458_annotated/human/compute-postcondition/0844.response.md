According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 3, `i` is `m + 2`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` is at least 1, and `j` is 2**
