The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves manipulating the `dp` 2D list. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to the last bit of `i + 1`, effectively determining which row to access in the 2D list based on the parity of `i`. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is being assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Given that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the operation will successfully copy the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from [i + 1 & 1][j][k]; `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
