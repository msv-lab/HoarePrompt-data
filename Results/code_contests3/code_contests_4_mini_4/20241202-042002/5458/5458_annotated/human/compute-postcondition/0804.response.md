The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables, but it will skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Since there are no specific loop details provided, the current state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index [1][4][1] with the value from index [1][3][1]; `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
