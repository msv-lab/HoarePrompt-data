Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`; `k` is at most `s`, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `dp` is modified accordingly.***
