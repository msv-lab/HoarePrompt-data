According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`. The current state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means the loop has already executed for all values from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, but since `range(1, s + 1)` does not include `s + 1`, the loop will not execute again.

Given that the loop cannot execute again, the state does not need to be adjusted for another iteration. However, if we were to consider the next possible state, `k` would be the next value after `s`, which is `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` would need to be incremented beyond `s`, which is already `s + 1` (the loop will not execute again as it is out of range).**
