The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is `2` and `k` is `2`, we need to calculate the indices for `dp`. 

The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates as follows:
- `i + 1` is `3`.
- `3 & 1` results in `1` (since in binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, their AND operation results in `01`, which is `1`).

Thus, the assignment translates to `dp[1][j + 1][2] = 1`. The value of `j` is not specified, but the assignment will affect the `dp` list at the indices `1`, `j + 1`, and `2`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `k` is 2, `i` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `k` is 2, `i` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.**
