The statement updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The dimensions of `dp` suggest that it is a 2D list where `i`, `j`, and `k` are indices within the defined bounds. The exact values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not specified, but the operation indicates that the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be affected by the previous state of `dp` at the respective indices.

Therefore, the output state reflects the current operation while acknowledging that the previous values contribute to the calculation:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
