The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is 1, so `i + 1` is 2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `2 & 1`, which is 0. Therefore, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`. The variable `j` is 1, so `j + 1` is 2. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` can be any valid index in the range of `dp` dimensions, and thus, other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`dp[0][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][1][k]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
