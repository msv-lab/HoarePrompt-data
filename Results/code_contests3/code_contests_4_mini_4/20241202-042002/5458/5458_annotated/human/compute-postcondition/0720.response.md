The line of code updates a specific entry in the 2D list `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in either `0` or `1`, and since `i` can be either `0` or `1`, this expression effectively toggles between the two indices of the first dimension of `dp`. The value of `j` is `s + 2`, and since `k` is equal to `1`, the entry being assigned is `dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 1][1]`. The right-hand side, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, translates to `dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 2][1]`.

The impact of this code is that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 1][1]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 2][1]`. Since `k` is equal to `1` and `j` is `s + 2`, the state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2; dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 1][1] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 2][1]**.
