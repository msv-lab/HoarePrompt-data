According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which currently has a value of 2. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute again if `k` is increased by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 3, and it should still hold that `s` is at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3.**
