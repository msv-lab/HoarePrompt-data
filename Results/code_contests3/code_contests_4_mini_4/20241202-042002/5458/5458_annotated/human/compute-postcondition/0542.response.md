Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `k` or the list `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
