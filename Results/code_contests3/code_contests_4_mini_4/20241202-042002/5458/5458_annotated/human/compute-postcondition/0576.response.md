According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would be at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must increment by 1. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than `s`. Thus, if the previous value of `k` was such that it was less than `s`, after the increment, it will be equal to `k + 1`. 

Since the loop starts with `k` equal to 1, for the next iteration, `k` would need to be at least 2, and it will continue until it reaches `s`. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `k` will be 2.**
