The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. However, since the loop does not execute due to `k` being greater than 2, the state of the variables does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 4, `i` is m + 2, `j` is 2, and the loop does not execute.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 4, `i` is m + 2, `j` is 2, and the loop does not execute.**
