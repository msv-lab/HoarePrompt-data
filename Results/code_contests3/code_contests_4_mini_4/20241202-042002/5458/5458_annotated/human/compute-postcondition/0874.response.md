The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The initial state indicates that `j` is greater than `k`, which means the assignment will take place. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. 

Since the other variables do not change in this operation, the output state reflects the updated value of the `dp` list. Thus, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**.
