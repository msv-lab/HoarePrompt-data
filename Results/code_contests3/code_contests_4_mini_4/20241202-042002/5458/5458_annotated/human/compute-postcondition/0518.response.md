Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `i` is 2; `m` is at least 1; `j` is at least `m + 1`, and `s` is at least `s`; the values in `dp` are updated based on the conditions of the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or modified according to previous values in `dp` otherwise.**
