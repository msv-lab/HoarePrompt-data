Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `dp[0][s + 3][s + 1]` is updated based on `dp[1][s + 2][-1] % mod`.***
