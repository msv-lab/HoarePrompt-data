According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the limit defined by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. 

Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, after the current iteration, `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be such that \( n^2 \) is greater than 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), where each inner list contains values that represent the accumulation of possible combinations based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`; `i` is 2, `j` is at least `m`, `k` is at most `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
