Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [0 or 1][2][s + 1] to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
