The code snippet `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, it does not affect any variable values directly. Therefore, while the execution will continue, no changes are made to the existing variable values.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
