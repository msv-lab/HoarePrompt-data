The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one position of the 2D list `dp` to another. Here, the indices involve bitwise operations and the variable `k`.

The value of `k` is 3. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. The operation `j + 1` increments the index `j` by 1.

Since `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) and each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, the assignment will simply propagate the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` (which is currently zero) into `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

The specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided, but we know that the assignment affects only the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` (which is still zero).

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` (which is still zero).**
