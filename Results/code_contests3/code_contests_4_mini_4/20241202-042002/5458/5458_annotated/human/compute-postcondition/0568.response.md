The line of code modifies a specific element in the 2D list `dp`. The indices used are computed as follows: `i + 1 & 1` gives a value that toggles between 0 and 1 based on the parity of `i`, and `j + 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. The value of `k` is assigned as `current_value + 1`.

Since `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), this operation assigns the value `1` to the specific location indicated by the indices. The previous values of `dp` at that location affect the result, but since they are not specified, we know that the location will now hold the value `1`.

Thus, the other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is modified at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be `1`.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be `1`**.
