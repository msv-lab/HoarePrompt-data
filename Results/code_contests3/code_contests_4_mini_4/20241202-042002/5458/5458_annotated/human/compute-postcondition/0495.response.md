Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is 1; `i` is 2; `j` is at least 2; `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1]` and the current iteration is skipped. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any operations related to this condition.***
