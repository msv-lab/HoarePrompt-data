The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The variables `dp` and `mod` are not affected, and the specific values of `j` and `k` are not provided, but it is stated that `j` is not greater than `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects the update made to the `dp` list.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
