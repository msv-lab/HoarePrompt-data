According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `s` must be at least 1 since `xrange(1, s + 1)` requires `s` to be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2 during the second iteration, which means the loop must have executed at least once before reaching this state. Therefore, the initial state before the loop must account for these conditions.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be at least 1, and `k` is 2 for the second iteration**
