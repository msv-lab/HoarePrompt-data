The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the 2D list `dp`. 

1. `i` is equal to `m + 2`. Since `m` is at least 4, `i` is at least 6.
2. `j` is equal to 4.
3. `k` is equal to 3.
4. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes to 0 because `i + 1` will be an even number (at least 7), so `& 1` gives 0.
5. The expression `i & 1` computes to 0 because `i` is even.
6. Hence, `dp[0][j + 1][k] += dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` translates to `dp[0][5][3] += dp[0][4][0] % mod`.

Now, `k - j` equals `3 - 4`, which is negative and typically would not be valid for indexing unless the implementation allows for it (but in a standard scenario, it would be out of bounds). Assuming it leads to a valid operation in this context, we proceed.

This results in updating `dp[0][5][3]` to its current value plus the value of `dp[0][4][0] % mod`. Other variables' states are unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at position [0][5][3] based on the value from [0][4][0], `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `i` is equal to `m + 2`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position [0][5][3] based on the value from [0][4][0], `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `i` is equal to `m + 2`.**
