Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing computed values based on the dynamic programming logic applied for all `i` from 0 to `n^2 - 1`, `j` from 1 to `m`, and `k` from 1 to `s`; `i` is `n^2`; `j` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is at most `s`; `n`, `m`, `s` are the values from the input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains a 2D list filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1).**
