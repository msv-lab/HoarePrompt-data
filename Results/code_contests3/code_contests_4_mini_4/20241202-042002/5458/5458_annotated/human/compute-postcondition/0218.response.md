The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1` is at least 1, and applying the bitwise AND with 1 will yield 1 if `i` is odd and 0 if `i` is even. The values of `s`, `k`, and `j` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
