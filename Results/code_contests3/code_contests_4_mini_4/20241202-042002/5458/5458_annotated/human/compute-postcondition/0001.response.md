In this case, the `while` loop is defined as `while 1:`, which is equivalent to `while True:`. This indicates that the loop is designed to execute indefinitely, regardless of the state of any variables. Therefore, there are no specific conditions that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000, `mod` is 100000**.
