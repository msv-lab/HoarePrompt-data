Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` is `m + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` is at least 1, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][2][0] % mod`.***
