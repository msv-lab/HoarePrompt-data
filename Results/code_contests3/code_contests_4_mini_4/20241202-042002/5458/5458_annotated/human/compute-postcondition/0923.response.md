The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it merely skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, and the program will continue executing from the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[1][5][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][4][3]`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `i` is equal to `m + 2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
