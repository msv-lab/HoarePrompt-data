Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at position `[1][j + 1][2]` to `1`. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, while other values remain unchanged.***
