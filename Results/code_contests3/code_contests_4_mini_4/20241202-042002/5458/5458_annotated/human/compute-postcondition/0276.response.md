According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `m`, meaning that the loop has executed for all values from 1 to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented. 

Since the loop starts at 1 and goes to `m`, if it were to execute again, `j` would need to be greater than `m`. Therefore, the next state would have `j` as `m + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than `m`, so `j` is `m + 1`.**
