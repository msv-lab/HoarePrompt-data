The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
