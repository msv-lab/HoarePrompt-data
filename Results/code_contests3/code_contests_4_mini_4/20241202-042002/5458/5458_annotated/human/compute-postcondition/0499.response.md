According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop a second time, `k` must be 2 and `s` must be at least 2 (as the loop runs from 1 to `s`, inclusive).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `k` is 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
