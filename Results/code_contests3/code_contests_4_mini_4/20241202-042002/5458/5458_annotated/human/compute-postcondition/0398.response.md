According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 (the first iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be at least 2.**
