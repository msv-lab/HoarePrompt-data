The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated such that `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `i` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
