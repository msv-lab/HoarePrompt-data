According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has a final value reflecting the last executed index in the range, which is less than or equal to `m`. Given that `i` is 1, this indicates that the loop has executed at least once. After the last iteration, the value of `j` is known, and `k` is equal to `s`.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be updated to `j + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1); `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
