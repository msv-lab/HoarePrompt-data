Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is the total number of iterations executed; `k` is equal to `s`; `i` is `s + 1`; `j` is 1; `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, where values depend on the relationships between `i`, `j`, and `k`, with specific updates occurring based on those conditions.**
