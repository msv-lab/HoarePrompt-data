According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` can take on a value within the specified range. The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `m`, meaning that for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Additionally, since `k` is equal to `s`, and `s` is at least 2, `k` will also remain valid as `s` does not change in this context.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is `s`, `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2 and `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
