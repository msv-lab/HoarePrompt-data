The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside due to the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
