According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for `k = current_value`, where `current_value` is the last value of `k` used during the previous iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be `current_value + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` does not exceed `s`. 

Given that the last executed value of `k` was `current_value`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least `current_value + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to `current_value + 1`, and `k` is `current_value + 1`.**
