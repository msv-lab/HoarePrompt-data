According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
