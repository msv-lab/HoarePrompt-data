Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `k` is 1, and `i` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is at least 2, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, with `k` being at least 1 and `j` being at least 2, which may involve an invalid index.***
