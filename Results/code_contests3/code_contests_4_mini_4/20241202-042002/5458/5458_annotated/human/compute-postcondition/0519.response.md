According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, `i` will become 3, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `i` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3**
