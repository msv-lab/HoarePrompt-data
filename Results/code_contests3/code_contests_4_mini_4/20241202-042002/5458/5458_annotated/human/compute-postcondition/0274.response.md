Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`; `k` is equal to `s + 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k` but the condition for `i` is not met, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to index out of bounds.***
