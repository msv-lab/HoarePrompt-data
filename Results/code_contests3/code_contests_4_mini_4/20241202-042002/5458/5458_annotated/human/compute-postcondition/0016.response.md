The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves accessing and assigning values in a 2D list `dp`. The value of `i + 1 & 1` will determine which index of the first dimension of `dp` is being accessed, while `j + 1` indicates the index in the second dimension. The assignment copies the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

We know that:
- `i` is not equal to 0, meaning `i` can be either 1 or greater.
- `j` is greater than `k`, which is 1, so `j` must be at least 2.
- The variable `s` does not directly affect the operation in this snippet.

Given this, we can summarize the impact:
- The value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is being assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific values of `dp` are not provided, but we can affirm that the operation will update the 2D list accordingly.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
