According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which is bounded by the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is currently at a value that is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, if `k` was `s` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `k` will be `k + 1`.**
