According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the final value of `j + 1`, which means `j` is now equal to `m + 1`. Since `j` must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute again, and `k` is `s + 1`, we need to adjust `j` to be equal to `m + 1` and increment `j` by 1, making it `m + 2`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 2`, and `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**
