According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `s`. The loop is defined to iterate from `1` to `s + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. 

Given the state before the loop starts, we have:
- `k` is equal to `s`
- `i` is `s + 1`
- `j` is `3`

Since `s` is stated as at least equal to the total number of iterations executed, it implies that `s` could be `0` or more. If `s` is `0`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be greater than or equal to `1`. 

Moreover, `k` needs to be adjusted to reflect the value of `s`, which will also be `1` for the loop to execute for the first time. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `i` is now 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
