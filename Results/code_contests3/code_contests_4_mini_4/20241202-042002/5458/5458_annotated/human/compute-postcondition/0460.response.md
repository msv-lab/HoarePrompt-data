The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that a value from the `dp` array is being assigned to another position within the same array. Here, `i + 1 & 1` calculates the modulo operation for `i + 1` with respect to 2, which helps in toggling between two states (0 and 1) based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` is 3, and `3 & 1` results in 1. Therefore, the left-hand side index simplifies to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. 

The right-hand side also uses `j + 1` and remains indexed by `k`, which is valid since `j` is greater than `k`. The value being assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is the value at `dp[1][j][k]`. 

The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]**.
