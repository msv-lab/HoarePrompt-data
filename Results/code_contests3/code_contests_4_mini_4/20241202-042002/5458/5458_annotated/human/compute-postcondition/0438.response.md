Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is updated to the value of `dp[0][j][2]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
