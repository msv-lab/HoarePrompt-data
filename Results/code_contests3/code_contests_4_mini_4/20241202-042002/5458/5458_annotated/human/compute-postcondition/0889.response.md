The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`, which will result in either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. Since `i` is `m + 2` and `m` is at least `2`, `i` will be at least `4`, making `i + 1` at least `5`, which is odd. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.

The values of `j` and `k` are `3` and `3`, respectively. Therefore, the assignment becomes:
```
dp[1][4][3] = dp[1][3][3]
```
Given that `j + 1` is `4`, we are accessing the fourth index in the second dimension and the third index in the third dimension.

The output state reflects the values of `dp` that have been updated according to the assignment. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is `m + 2`, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, so `dp[1][4][3]` is set equal to `dp[1][3][3]`; `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `i` is m + 2.**
