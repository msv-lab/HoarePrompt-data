Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1); `i` is `n^2`; `j` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is at most `s`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
