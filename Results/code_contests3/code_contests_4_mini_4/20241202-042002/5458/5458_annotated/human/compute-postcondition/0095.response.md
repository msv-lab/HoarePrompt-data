The statement modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous state shows that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was assigned a value, but now it is updated by an additional term.

The variables `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are affected. The exact values of these variables depend on the specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod`, which are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact numerical value after the operation, but we can state the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.**
