Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there are no updates made to `dp` in the current iteration.***
