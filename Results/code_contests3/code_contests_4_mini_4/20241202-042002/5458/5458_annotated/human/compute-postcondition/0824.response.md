The code updates the `dp` list at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which evaluates to `[1][4][3]` given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. The value assigned to this index is the result of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, which evaluates to `dp[1][3][3] % mod`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index [1][4][3] to the value of `dp[1][3][3] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][4][3] to the value of `dp[1][3][3] % mod`**
