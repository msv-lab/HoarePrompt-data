According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be updated to `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1), for the loop to execute one more time k must be less than or equal to s, and k is now k + 1.**
