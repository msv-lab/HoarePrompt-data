Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, and `i` is equal to m + 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the element at index [1][5][1] in `dp` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][5][1]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, but there will be an invalid access for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` due to a negative index.***
