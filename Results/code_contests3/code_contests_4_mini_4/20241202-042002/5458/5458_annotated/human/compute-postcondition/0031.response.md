According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2, and `s` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute one more time for `k` equal to 3. 

Thus, the states to be adjusted are the value of `k`, which will be updated to 3, and we also need to ensure that `s` is still at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
