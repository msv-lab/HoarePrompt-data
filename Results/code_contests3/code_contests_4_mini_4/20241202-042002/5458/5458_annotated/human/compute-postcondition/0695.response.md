According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. 

Given that `k` is defined as `s + 1`, the initial value of `k` will be 1 when `s` is 0, which means the loop will not execute in that case. Additionally, since the loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, `s` must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:

1. `s` must be at least 1 (so that `k` starts from 1).
2. `s` must be less than or equal to `m`.

At the start of the first execution of the loop, `i` can either be 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2`, but these values do not impact the ability of the loop to execute.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be less than or equal to `m`**
