The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the modulo of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` by `mod`. The dimensions of `dp` are (2, M + 2), and since `i` is 2, the expression evaluates `i + 1 & 1`, which results in 0. 

Thus, the expression simplifies to `dp[0][j + 1][k] = dp[0][j][k] % mod`. The values of `j` and `k` are known as `k` is 2 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. This means that we are updating `dp[0][j + 1][2]` based on the value of `dp[0][j][2]`.

The output state reflects that this value in `dp` has been updated without changing any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at position [0][j + 1][2] based on the value of `dp[0][j][2] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position [0][j + 1][2] based on the value of `dp[0][j][2] % mod**
