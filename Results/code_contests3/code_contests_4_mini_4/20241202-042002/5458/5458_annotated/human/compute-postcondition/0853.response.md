According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, making `k` 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must still be 2. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 4, `i` is `m + 2`, and `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to 2.**
