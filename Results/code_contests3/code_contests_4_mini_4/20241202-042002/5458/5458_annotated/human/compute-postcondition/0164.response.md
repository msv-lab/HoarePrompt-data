Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp` remains unchanged in dimensions, `s` remains at least 2, and `k` remains 3, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` when `j` is less than or equal to `k.***
