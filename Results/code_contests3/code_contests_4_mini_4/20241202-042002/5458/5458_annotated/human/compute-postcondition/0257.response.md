According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means the loop has just completed its last iteration since it starts at 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. 

To execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to `s + 2`, and since the loop does not execute for this value, `s` must remain unchanged. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`, `k` is equal to `s + 2`, for the loop to execute an additional time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
