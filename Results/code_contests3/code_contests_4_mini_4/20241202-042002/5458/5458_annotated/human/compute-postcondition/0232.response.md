Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is modified at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
