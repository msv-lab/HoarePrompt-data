The code snippet `continue` is a control flow statement that does not change the values of any variables directly. Instead, it affects the flow of execution within a loop, causing the current iteration to end and moving to the next iteration. 

The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] where i is at least 4 and j is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.`

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] where i is at least 4 and j is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.`**
