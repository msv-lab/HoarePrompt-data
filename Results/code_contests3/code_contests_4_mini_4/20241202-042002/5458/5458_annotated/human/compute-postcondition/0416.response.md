Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is `s + 1`; `i` is 1; and `j` is `m + 2`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` will be 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][m + 2][k]` will be updated based on `dp[1][m + 2][k]` and `dp[0][m + 2][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
