Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least `s`, `k` is `s`, `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i` and `j`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.**
