According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased by 1, making it 4. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `i` is 0**
