According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which is the loop control variable. The loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3.

For the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Thus, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `k` is 3, and for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3**
