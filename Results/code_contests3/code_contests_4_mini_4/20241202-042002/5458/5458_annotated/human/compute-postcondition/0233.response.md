According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the third time because the range of `k` is from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, and `s` must still be at least 3 (to allow the loop to run).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
