Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes to `dp` occur in this iteration.***
