The line of code updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous state of `dp` at the specified indices is crucial for determining the result of this operation, but without specific values for `i`, `j`, `k`, or `mod`, we cannot quantify the new value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] by adding dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod to its previous value.**
