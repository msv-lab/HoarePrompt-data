The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated in position `[0][j + 1][2]` to have the value of `dp[0][j][2]`, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
