According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `m + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `m` is at least 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented to 4, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4. However, since `m` is at least 2, the loop can still execute again as long as `m` is at least 4. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `j` needs to be 4, and `m` must be at least 4.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4; `i` is m + 2.**
