The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the current state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and the modulo operation with `mod`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the new value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
