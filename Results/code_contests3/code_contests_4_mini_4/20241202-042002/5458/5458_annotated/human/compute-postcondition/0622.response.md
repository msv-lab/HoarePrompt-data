According to the code, the `while 1:` loop is an infinite loop, meaning it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute one more time, as it will continue to do so regardless of the current state.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing computed values based on the dynamic programming logic; `n` is `n^2`; `m` is at least `m + 1`; `s` is at most `s`; the printed value is `dp[n`**
