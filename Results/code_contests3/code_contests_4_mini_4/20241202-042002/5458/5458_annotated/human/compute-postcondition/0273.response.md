The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. Since `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `k - j` will be less than `0`, and typically accessing an index out of bounds in a list will raise an error. However, if we assume that the code handles this scenario gracefully, the assignment would not change the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State indicates that the assignment operation could not be completed due to the index being out of bounds.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`; `k` is equal to `s + 2; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is unchanged due to index out of bounds.**
