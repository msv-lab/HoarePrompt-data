Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is at least m + 2 where m is at least 2, `j` is 3, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp`.***
