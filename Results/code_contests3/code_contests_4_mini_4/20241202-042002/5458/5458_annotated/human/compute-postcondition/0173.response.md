Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) and `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 4, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][4]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than 4, there are no changes made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][4]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][4 - j] % mod`, maintaining that `s` is at least 2 and `dp` retains its 2D list structure.***
