According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and its relation to `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is within the range defined by `xrange(1, m + 1)`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
