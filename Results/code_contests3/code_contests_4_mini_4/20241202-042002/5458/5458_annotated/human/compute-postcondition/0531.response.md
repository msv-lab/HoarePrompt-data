The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Given that `i` is 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is greater than 3, we need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1` and `j + 1`. 

Calculating:
- `i + 1` results in 4, and `4 & 1` gives 0 (since 4 in binary is `100` and 1 is `001`, their bitwise AND results in `000`).
- `j + 1` will be at least 5 (since `j` is greater than 3).

Thus, `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][3] % mod`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 3, `j` is greater than 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3; `dp[0][j + 1][3] = dp[0][j][3] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 3, `j` is greater than 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3; `dp[0][j + 1][3] = dp[0][j][3] % mod**
