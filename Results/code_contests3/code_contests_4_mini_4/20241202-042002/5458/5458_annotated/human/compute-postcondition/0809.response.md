According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 1, and `s` is at least 1. Since `k` will be incremented in the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2, and `k` will become 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is equal to 2; `i` remains 2, `j` remains 3**
