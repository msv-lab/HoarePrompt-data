The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` updates a specific element in the 2D list `dp`. The indices used in the assignment involve bitwise operations and increments.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. The operation `& 1` effectively checks if `i + 1` is even or odd.
2. The indices `j + 1` and `k` are used directly for accessing the 2D list.
3. The left side accesses `dp` at a certain position which is determined by the computed indices and assigns it the value from the right side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Since the specific values of `i` and `j` are not provided, we can't determine the exact outcome of the indices. However, we know that the operation modifies the `dp` list, with the value being copied from one element to another within the same 2D list.

Therefore, the output state acknowledges the update while noting that specific values are not determinable.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
