Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `i` is 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp` is updated at index [1][j + 1][k], with `s` still at least 4 and `k` equal to 4.***
