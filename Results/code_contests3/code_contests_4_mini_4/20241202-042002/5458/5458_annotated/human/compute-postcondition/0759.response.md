The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` attempts to update the value at `dp` for the specified indices. However, since the loop does not execute again because `k` is out of range, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not changed by this operation as it would not be executed. 

Given that:
- `s` remains at least 1,
- `k` is `s + 1`,
- `i` is `s + 1`,
- `j` is 1,
- and the loop does not execute again due to `k` being out of range,

The values of the variables are unaffected by the code execution as the operation does not take place.

Output State: **`dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, `j` is 1, and the loop does not execute again.**
