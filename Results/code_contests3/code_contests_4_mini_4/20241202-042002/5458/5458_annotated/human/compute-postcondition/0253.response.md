Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least `s`, `k` is at most `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be `s + 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
