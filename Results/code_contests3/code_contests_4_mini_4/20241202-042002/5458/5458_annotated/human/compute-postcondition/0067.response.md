The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since the dimensions of `dp` are (2, M + 2), this operation updates a specific element in the 2D list based on the current indices `i`, `j`, and `k`. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly defined, but the assignment operation indicates that we are modifying one element of the `dp` list based on the value of another element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
