The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves the assignment of the value `1` to a specific index of the 2D list `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` evaluates to `1`. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.
2. The value of `j` is `3`, so `j + 1` evaluates to `4`.
3. The value of `k` is `1`.

Therefore, `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value `1`.

The other variables (`dp`, `s`, `k`, `m`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `i` is 0; `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
