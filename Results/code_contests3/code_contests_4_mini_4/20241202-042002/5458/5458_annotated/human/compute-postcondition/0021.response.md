Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while the state of `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing (S + 1) zeros.***
