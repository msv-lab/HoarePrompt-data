According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will run for `k` values from 1 to `s`, which means it will execute at least once if `s` is at least 1. The current state indicates that `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means the loop will not execute because the starting value of `k` (which is 1) does not reach `s + 1`. 

To ensure that the loop executes, `s` must be adjusted to at least 1. Additionally, since `k` is initialized to 1 for the loop to start executing, `k` should take the value of 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
