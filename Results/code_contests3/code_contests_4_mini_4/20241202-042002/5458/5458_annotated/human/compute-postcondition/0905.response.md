The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The previous values of the affected variables remain as stated.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, resulting in `dp[1][5][1]` being updated from `dp[1][4][1]`; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 1; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4; `i` is at least 6; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
