Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is `s + 1`, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [i + 1][j + 1][k] with value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no updates are made to `dp`.***
