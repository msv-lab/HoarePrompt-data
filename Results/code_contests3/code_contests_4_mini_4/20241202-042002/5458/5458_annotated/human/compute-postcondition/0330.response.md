The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the value of `dp` at a specific position. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known: `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.

1. Calculate `i + 1 & 1`:  
   - `i + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`, and `2 & 1` results in `0` (because the binary representation of 2 is `10` and of 1 is `01`, so the bitwise AND gives `00`).

2. Calculate `j + 1`:  
   - `j + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`.

3. The position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` translates to `dp[0][2][k]`.

4. Calculate `i & 1`:  
   - `i & 1` is `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.

5. Now, we are looking at `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, which translates to `dp[1][1][k - 1]`.

6. The expression modifies `dp[0][2][k]` by adding the value of `dp[1][1][k - 1] % mod`.

The state of `dp` changes at `dp[0][2][k]`, while the other variables (`i`, `j`, and `mod`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is modified at position `[0][2][k]` by adding `dp[1][1][k - 1] % mod`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at position `[0][2][k]` by adding `dp[1][1][k - 1] % mod`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1**.
