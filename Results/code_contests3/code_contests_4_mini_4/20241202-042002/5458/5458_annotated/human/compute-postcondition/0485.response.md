According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `s`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be at least `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is equal to `s`, `i` remains as 2; `j` is at least `s + 1`, and the values in `dp` at indices [1][j + 1][1] to [1][j + 1][s] are updated based on conditions and previous values in `dp`.**
