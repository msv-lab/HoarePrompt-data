Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop without changing any variable values.***
