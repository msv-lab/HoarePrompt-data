The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][4]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][4]`, but since the `continue` statement is executed, the remaining code in the current iteration is skipped. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. The initial values of `dp`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 4 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
