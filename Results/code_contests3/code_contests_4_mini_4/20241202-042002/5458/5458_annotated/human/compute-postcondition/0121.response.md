The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated, but the specific values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod` are not provided. Therefore, the output state focuses on the change made.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
