According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, meaning that for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. The variable `k` will start at `1` for the first iteration. The state of `dp` does not affect the loop's execution since it is not involved in the loop condition.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than 0, `k` is 1**
