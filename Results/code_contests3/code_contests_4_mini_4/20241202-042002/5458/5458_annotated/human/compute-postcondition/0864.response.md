According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, which it is since `s` is 2. Therefore, the loop will execute for values of `k` equal to 1 and 2. 

To execute a third time, the loop must be able to iterate again. In this case, `k` can take values from 1 to `s + 1` (which is 3), meaning it can loop for `k` equal to 1, 2, and 3. However, since `s` is 2, the loop will execute only twice (for `k` equal to 1 and 2). 

To ensure that the loop can execute a third time, `s` must be increased to at least 3. Additionally, we need to ensure that `k` is initialized appropriately for the loop to begin executing. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `i` is m + 2, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 2, `j` is 3**
