According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is a certain value, but we need to focus on `k`. 

Since `k` is currently at its last value used in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. This means that the new value of `k` will be the previous value of `k` plus 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which means that `k` should be updated to `k + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be updated to be less than or equal to `s` and `k` is now `k + 1`.**
