Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` is updated at indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; otherwise, there are no updates made to `dp` in the current iteration.***
