The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` impacts the values of the `dp` list based on the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0`, since `i + 1` is 4 and `4 & 1` is 0. For `j`, since `j` is 2, the expression `j + 1` results in `3`. `k` remains unchanged.

Thus, the assignment will be made to `dp[0][3][k] = 1`.

The other variables `s`, `m`, and the dimensions of `dp` are not directly altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to the `dp` list while maintaining the other variables.

Output State: **`dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1; `s` is at least 2; `k` is at least 2; `i` is 3; `j` is 2.**
