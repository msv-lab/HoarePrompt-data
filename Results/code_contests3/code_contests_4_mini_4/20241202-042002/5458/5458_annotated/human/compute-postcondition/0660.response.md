Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing values based on the combination of previous states; `s` is the total number of iterations executed; `k` is equal to `s`; `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, and `j` varies based on the loop execution logic. The values in `dp` are determined by the conditions applied during the iterations of the loop.**
