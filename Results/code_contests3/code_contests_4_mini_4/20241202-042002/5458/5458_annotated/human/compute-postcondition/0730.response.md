According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, meaning that for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Given that `k` is equal to `s`, this implies that `k` will also be at least 1. The loop starts with `k` at 1 when the loop executes for the first time. 

Since `i` is `s + 1`, it will be greater than 1 if `s` is at least 1. The variable `j` does not impact the execution of this loop.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is `s + 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1.**
