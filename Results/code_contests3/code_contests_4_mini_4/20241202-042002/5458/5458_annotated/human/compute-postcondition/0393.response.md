The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, and it notes that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `i` is 1; `j` is m + 2; `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
