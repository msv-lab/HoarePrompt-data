The value of `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `j` is equal to `s + 2`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `1` or `0`, depending on the value of `i` (which is either `0` or `1`). Therefore, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` refers to `dp[1][s + 3][s + 1]` if `i` is `0` or `dp[0][s + 3][s + 1]` if `i` is `1`. 

The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This means the value from the position determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, and `k` is copied to the position determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The other variables (`dp`, `s`, `i`, `k`, and `j`) are not changed in value, only the values in the `dp` list are updated.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at the position determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` with the value from the position `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, and `k`; `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2.**
