Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[0][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` remains unchanged if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
