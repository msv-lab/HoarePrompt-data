Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is at least 2; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; and for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2; `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
