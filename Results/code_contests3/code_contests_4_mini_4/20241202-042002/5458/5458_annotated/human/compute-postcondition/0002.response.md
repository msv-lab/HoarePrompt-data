The code assigns values to `n`, `m`, and `s` by reading a single line of input and splitting it into three integers. The initial state indicates that `N`, `M`, and `S` are within specified ranges, but the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `s` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now assigned based on the input values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000, `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values based on input.**
