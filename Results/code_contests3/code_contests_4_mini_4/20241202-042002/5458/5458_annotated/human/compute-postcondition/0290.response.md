According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 2. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is equal to 0, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` which is at least 1**
