Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, while the values of other variables remain unchanged.***
