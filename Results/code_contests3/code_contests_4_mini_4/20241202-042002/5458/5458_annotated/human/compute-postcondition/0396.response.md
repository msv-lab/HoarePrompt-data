The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Here, `i` is 1, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `0`, and `i & 1` results in `1`. The value of `j` is `m + 2`, so `j + 1` is `m + 3`. The variable `k` is 1, hence `k - j` becomes `1 - (m + 2)`, which is `-m - 1`.

The code updates `dp[0][m + 3][1]` by adding the value of `dp[1][m + 2][-m - 1] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[1][m + 2][-m - 1]` is unknown, but it affects the value of `dp[0][m + 3][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[0][m + 3][1]` is updated based on `dp[1][m + 2][-m - 1] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[0][m + 3][1]` is updated based on `dp[1][m + 2][-m - 1] % mod**
