The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the affected variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
