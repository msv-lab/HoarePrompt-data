The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the nearest loop. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables while noting that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is 3; `s` must be at least 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop.**
