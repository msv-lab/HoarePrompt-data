The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop, returning to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values but indicates that we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2; we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
