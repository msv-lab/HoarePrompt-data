The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] with the value from index [i + 1 & 1][j][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] with the value from index [i + 1 & 1][j][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
