According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, and `i` is m + 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
