Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, and `i` is equal to `m + 2`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][5][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][5][3]` is updated based on the value from `dp[0][4][0]`, while the conditions for `s`, `k`, `m`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
