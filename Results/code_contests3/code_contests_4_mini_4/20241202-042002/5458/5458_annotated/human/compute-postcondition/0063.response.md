Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` with the value `1`. If `j` is less than `k`, no updates are made to `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `dp`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
