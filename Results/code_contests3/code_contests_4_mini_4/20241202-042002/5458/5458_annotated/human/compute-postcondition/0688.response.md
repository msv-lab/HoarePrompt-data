The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop, proceeding to the next iteration. Since the specific values of `dp` and the current loop context are not provided, we cannot determine any updates or changes to the variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
