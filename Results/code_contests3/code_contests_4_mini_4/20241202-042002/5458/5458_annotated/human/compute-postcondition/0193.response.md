The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
