Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 4, `i` is m + 2, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, no assignment occurs. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][4]` is updated with `dp[i & 1][2][2] % mod`, while `s` remains 2 and `k` is still 4.***
