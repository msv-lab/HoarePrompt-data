According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit defined by `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `m + 1`, and we need to ensure that the loop can run for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `m + 2`. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, which means that `m + 2` must be less than `n ** 2`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is equal to the total number of iterations executed; `k` is equal to `s`; `i` is `m + 2`; for the loop to execute a second time, `n ** 2` must be greater than `m + 2`**
