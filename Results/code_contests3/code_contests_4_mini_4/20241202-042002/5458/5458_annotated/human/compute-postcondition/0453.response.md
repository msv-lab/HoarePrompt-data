According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 because the range of `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`. Since `s` is at least `s` (its final value after the loop) and `k` is also set to `s` (its final value after the loop), `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list, and its state is not directly relevant to the execution of this loop. The values of `i`, `m`, and `j` also do not influence the execution of this particular loop.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `s` should be at least 1.
- Before the loop starts, `k` should be initialized to 1 (the starting value of the loop index).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
