According to the code, the for loop iterates over the variable `k`, starting from 1 up to `s`. The loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, changing `k` to 3. Thus, for the loop to execute an additional time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which means `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` remains 2; `j` remains 3.**
