The code snippet `continue` is intended to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, it does not change the values of any variables in the current state, nor does it produce any new assignments or calculations. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 2; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4; `i` is equal to m + 2; `dp[1][5][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][4][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
