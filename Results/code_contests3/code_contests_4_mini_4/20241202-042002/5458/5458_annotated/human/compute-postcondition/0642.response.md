According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `k` will be adjusted to 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2.**
