The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` performs an assignment within a 3D array structure. The computation `i + 1 & 1` calculates the new index for the first dimension of `dp`, while `j + 1` calculates the new index for the second dimension. The third dimension index `k` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2)
- `s` is at least `s`
- `k` is at most `s`
- `k` must be `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time
- `i` is not equal to 0
- `j` is greater than `k`

The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. This means we are updating the state of the `dp` list at the specified indices based on the current values.

No specific values for `i`, `j`, or `k` are provided, but we know that `i + 1 & 1` will yield a valid index for the first dimension, and `j + 1` is valid given that `j` is greater than `k`.

Thus, the output state reflects the change made to the `dp` array without altering any other variables or their states.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
