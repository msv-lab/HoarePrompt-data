According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on a value greater than the current value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented. 

Since the loop uses `xrange(1, s + 1)`, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 (since `k` will take on the value 2 in the next iteration). 

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be 2. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2**
