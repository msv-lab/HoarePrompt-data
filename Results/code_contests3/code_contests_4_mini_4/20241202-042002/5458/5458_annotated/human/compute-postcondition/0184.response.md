The code `continue` is a statement that causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but we will skip the remainder of the current loop cycle. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `j` is 2 (less than or equal to `m`), and `i` is not equal to 0, with `j` greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
