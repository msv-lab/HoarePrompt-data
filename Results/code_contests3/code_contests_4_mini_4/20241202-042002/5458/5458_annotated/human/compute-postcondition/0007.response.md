According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n ** 2` times, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the loop index `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
