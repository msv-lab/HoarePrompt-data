According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1, which means the loop has executed with `k` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, `k` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. To execute the loop one more time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 2**
