Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1). If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is updated with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no updates occur.***
