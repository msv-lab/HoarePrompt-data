According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `n**2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value from the previous iteration, which is at most `n**2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

So, if `i` is currently `n**2 - 1`, in the next iteration `i` will become `n**2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `sqrt(n**2)`, which is `n`. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at most `s`, `k` is `s`, `j` is at least `m`, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than the square root of `n**2`, and `i` is `n**2`.**
