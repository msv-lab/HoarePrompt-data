The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `k` is `2`, and the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. Thus, the index for `dp` will be `dp[1][j + 1][2]`. The variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, but it would typically be an index iterating through a range. As such, the output state will reflect the assignment made in the 2D list.

Since the values of other variables are not impacted, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][j + 1][2] to 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is 0**
