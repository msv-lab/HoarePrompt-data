The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` evaluates to `1`. Since `0 & 1` is `0`, the first index becomes `0`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, so `j + 1` is at least `2`. The value of `k` is `1`. Therefore, the assignment affects `dp[0][j + 1][1]` which is updated to `1`. The values of `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [0][j + 1][1] to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1.**
