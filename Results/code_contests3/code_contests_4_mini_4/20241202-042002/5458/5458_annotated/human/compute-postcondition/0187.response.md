The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of `j` and `k` are at least 2 and 1 respectively, and since `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `k - j` is a valid index. The state of `dp` is modified, but the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0.**
