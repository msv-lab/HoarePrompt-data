The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2; `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
