The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `i` is `n^2`; `j` is at least `m + 1`; `k` is at most `s`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
