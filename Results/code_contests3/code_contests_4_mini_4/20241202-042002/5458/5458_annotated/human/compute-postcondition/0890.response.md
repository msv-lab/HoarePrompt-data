The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the current values intact. 

Output State: **`dp[1][4][3]` is set equal to `dp[1][3][3]`; `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `i` is m + 2; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
