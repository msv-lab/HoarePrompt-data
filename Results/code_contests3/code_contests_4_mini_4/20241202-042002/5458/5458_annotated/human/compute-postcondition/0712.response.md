The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at the position determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` with the value from the position `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, and `k`; `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
