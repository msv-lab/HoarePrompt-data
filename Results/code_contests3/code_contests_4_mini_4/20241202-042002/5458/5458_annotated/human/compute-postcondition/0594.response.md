In the given code snippet, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is odd or even, since the bitwise AND operation with 1 will yield the least significant bit of `i + 1`. 

The variable `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is given as 2. Therefore, the code modifies the `dp` list at indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k`, but the specific values cannot be determined due to the unspecified values of `i`, `j`, and the contents of `dp`.

Since the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` depend on the contents of the `dp` list and the indices, we can state the transformation without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is 2.**
