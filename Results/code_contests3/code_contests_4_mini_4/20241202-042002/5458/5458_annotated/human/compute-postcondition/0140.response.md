Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, then no changes are made to `dp`. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the value from [i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
