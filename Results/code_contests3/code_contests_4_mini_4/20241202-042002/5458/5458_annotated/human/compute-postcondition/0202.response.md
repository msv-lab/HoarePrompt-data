The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, and `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
