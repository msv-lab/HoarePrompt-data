The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as input; instead, it reads values for `N`, `M`, and `S` from an external source until it encounters the termination condition where all three values are 0. The function handles positive integers constrained by the following ranges: `N` must be between 1 and 7, `M` must be between 1 and 2000, and `S` must be between 1 and 3000. The output of the function is determined by the values of `N`, `M`, and `S` based on the specified conditions, but the exact return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads positive integers N, M, and S within specified ranges until all three are zero; the exact return value is based on these inputs but is not detailed in the description.**
