Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1); `i` is 1 if the loop executed, `j` is the final value of `j` after all iterations, and `k` is equal to `s` after the last iteration. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the corresponding `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, the values in `dp` are updated based on the conditions in the loop, reflecting the computations made during the iterations.**
