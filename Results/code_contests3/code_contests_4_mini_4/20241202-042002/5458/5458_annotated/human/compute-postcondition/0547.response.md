The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is `k + 1` and must be less than or equal to `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
