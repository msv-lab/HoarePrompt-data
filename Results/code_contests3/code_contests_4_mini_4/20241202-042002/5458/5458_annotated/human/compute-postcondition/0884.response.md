The code updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is unchanged prior to this operation, but it will now be modified based on the value derived from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged during this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `i`, `j`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
