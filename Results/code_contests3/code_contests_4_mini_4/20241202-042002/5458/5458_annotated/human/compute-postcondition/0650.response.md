Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `s`, `k`, and other variables remain unchanged.***
