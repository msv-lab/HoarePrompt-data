Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, and since `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` at position [0][s + 3][s + 1] is updated with the value from [0][s + 2][s + 1]; the loop continues to the next iteration.***
