Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is equal to 1; if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `s` remains at least 1, `k` remains 1, `i` remains 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no action taken. Otherwise, `i` remains 2, `j` remains 3, and the values of `dp` are updated with `dp[1][4][1]` set to `dp[1][3][1] % mod` and `dp[0][4][1]` set to `dp[1][3][0] % mod`.***
