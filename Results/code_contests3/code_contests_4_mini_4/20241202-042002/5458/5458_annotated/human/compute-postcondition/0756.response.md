The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change to the existing variables, and we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][1][k]`; `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, `j` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
