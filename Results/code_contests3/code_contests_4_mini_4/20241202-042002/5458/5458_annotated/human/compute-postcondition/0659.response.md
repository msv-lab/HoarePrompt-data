Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value in `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, which could be either zero or some other value.***
