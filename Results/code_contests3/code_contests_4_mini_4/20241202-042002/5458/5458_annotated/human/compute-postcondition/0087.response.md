Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, maintaining that `j` is greater than `k`.***
