Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is now 2, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any operations in the else part.***
