According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, allowing the loop to run from 1 to `s`. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a 2D list, which does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but it is important to note that `k` will start at 1. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
