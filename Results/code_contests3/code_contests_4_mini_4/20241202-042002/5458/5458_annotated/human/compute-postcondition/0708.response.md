According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will iterate for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased to `s + 2`, which exceeds the upper limit of `s + 1`, meaning the loop will not execute again.

Thus, the state at the end of the last iteration is:
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2)
- `s` is at least 1
- `k` is equal to `s + 1`
- `i` is either 0 or 1
- `j` is equal to `s + 2`

Since the loop will not execute again, the relevant states for the next iteration would remain unchanged.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2**.
