Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the sum of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
