The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than 0; `k` is 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
