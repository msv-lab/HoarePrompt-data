The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the contents of the `dp` array are not provided, but we know that `k` is incremented by 1 (as `k` is now `k + 1`), and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since the previous context isn't given, we can only detail the assignment that occurs.

Thus, the Output State will reflect the change in `k` and the assignment operation in `dp`:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is now `k + 1`**.
