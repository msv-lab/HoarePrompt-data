Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1); `i` is 1; `j` is `j + 1`; `k` is `s + 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue without making any changes to the variable states.**
