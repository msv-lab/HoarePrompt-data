The variable `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` when `i` is `0`, and to `0` when `i` is `1`. Since `j` is `2` and `k` is `2`, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` will update the element at `dp[1][3][2]` when `i` is `0`, and will update `dp[0][3][2]` when `i` is `1`. The values of `s` and `M` do not affect this operation. The assignment sets the specified element in the `dp` list to `1`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
