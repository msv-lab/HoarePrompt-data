Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, and if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [1][j + 1][1] to `1`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
