Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least `s`, and `k` is equal to `s + 2`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program does not perform any updates.***
