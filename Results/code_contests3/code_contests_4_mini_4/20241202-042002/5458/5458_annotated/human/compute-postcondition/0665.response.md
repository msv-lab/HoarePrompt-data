The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since `i` is equal to `0`, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. The value of `j` is at least `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`. The variable `k` is `1`. Therefore, the assignment modifies the element `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; `i` is 0 or 1; `j` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**.
