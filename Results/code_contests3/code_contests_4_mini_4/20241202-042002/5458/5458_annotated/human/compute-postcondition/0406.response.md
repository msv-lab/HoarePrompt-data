Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is 2; `s` is at least 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, while the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` remain unchanged with respect to their previous values.***
