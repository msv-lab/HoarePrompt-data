Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing computed values based on the conditions in the loop; `i` is 1; `j` is `m + 1`; and `k` is `s`. The values in `dp[1][j + 1][k]` are determined by the conditions during the iterations, reflecting the results of the dynamic programming computations performed within the loop.**
