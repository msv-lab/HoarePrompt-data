The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. This operation modifies the `dp` list at the specified indices. Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, we assume that the assignment occurs directly as per the code snippet provided. However, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not specified in the initial state, so the exact numerical results of the operation cannot be determined.

The variables `s`, `k`, and `j` have their defined conditions, but they do not directly affect the assignment of `dp`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now reflect the result of the modulo operation on the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
