The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, provided that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros; `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros; `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
