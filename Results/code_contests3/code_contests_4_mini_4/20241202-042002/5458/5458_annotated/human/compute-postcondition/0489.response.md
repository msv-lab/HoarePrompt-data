The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the 2D list `dp`. 

- The previous value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` becomes 1. 
- The value of `j` is at least 2, which means `j + 1` is at least 3.
- The value of `k` is 1.

The operation `i + 1 & 1` effectively takes the value of `i + 1`, which is 1, and performs a bitwise AND operation with 1. Since `1 & 1` results in 1, the first index becomes 1.

Thus, we are accessing `dp[1][j + 1][1]` and assigning the value 1 to it. 

The output state describes the update made to the `dp` array. Since `dp` is modified but no other variables change, we keep the original values of `k`, `i`, and `j` intact in the output.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at dp[1][j + 1][1] to 1; `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is at least 2.**
