Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; if `i` is equal to 0 and for all `j` such that `j >= k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, for all `j` greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; otherwise, if `j` is less than or equal to `k`, no changes are made to `dp`.**
