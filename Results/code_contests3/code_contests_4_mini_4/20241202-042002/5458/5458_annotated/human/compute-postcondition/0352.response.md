According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` takes on values starting from 1 up to `s`. Before the loop starts, `k` is set to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`, which means it must be adjusted to `s + 1` so that the loop can execute its body when `k` reaches this value.

Additionally, the values of `i` and `j` before the loop do not affect the execution of the loop directly since they are not part of the loop's control variables. Therefore, we only need to focus on adjusting `k`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1), `i` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
