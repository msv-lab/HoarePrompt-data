The statement `continue` does not change any variable values but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `k`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
