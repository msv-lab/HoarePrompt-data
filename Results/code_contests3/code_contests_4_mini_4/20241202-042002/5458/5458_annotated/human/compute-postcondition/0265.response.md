Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least `s`; `k` is equal to `s + 2`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + (dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod)`; otherwise, no updates are performed.***
