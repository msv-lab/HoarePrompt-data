According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. Since `k` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `s`, for the loop to execute once more, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2 (since `k` will be incremented to 2). 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`**
