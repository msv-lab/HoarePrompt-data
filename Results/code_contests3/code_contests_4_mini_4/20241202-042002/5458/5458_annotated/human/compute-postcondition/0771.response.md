The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
