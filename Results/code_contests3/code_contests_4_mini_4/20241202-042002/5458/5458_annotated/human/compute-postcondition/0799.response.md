The value of `i` is currently 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1). The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves two parts: calculating the indices for accessing the `dp` list and assigning the value `1`.

1. The calculation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which results in `1 & 1 = 1`.
2. The value of `j + 1` will be greater than or equal to `2` since `j` is greater than or equal to `1`.
3. The third index is `k`, which is `1`.

Thus, the assignment can be expressed as `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1`.

The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp` are affected as follows:
- The 2D list `dp` will have its value at the position `[1][j + 1][1]` set to `1`.

The other variables (`s`, `k`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged, and we do not have specific values for `M` or `j`, but we know that `j` will lead to at least one valid index for the `dp` list.

Output State: **`dp` has a value of 1 at index [1][j + 1][1], `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1**.
