According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. Before the loop starts, `k` is at most `s`, which indicates that it can take on values within the specified range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted to allow it to take on the next value in the range. Since `k` is at most `s`, it should be incremented to `s + 1` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least `s`, `k` is at most `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be `s + 1`**
