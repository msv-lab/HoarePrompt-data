The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `i` is 0; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] and we skip the current iteration of the nearest loop.**
