According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its upper limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 2, and `s` is at least 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, so if `k` is currently 2, it will become 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is at least 3; `i` is 3; `j` is 2**
