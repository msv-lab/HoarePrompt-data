The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `i` is equal to 1 and `j` is equal to `s + 2`, we can calculate `i + 1 & 1` which results in `0` because `1 + 1 = 2` and `2 & 1` is `0`. Similarly, `j + 1` becomes `s + 3`. The value of `k` is `s + 1`. 

The previous state of `dp` at `dp[0][s + 2][s + 1]` is used to perform the modulo operation, but since the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value before the operation. Therefore, we note that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on an unknown value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Other variables remain unaffected. Consequently, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at position [0][s + 3][s + 1] based on an unknown value from [0][s + 2][s + 1], `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position [0][s + 3][s + 1] based on an unknown value from [0][s + 2][s + 1], `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is equal to 1, `j` is equal to `s + 2`**
