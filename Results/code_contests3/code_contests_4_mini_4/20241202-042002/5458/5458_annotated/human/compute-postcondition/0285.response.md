The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
