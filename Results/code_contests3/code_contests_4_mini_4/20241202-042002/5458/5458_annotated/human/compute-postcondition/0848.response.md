The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop where this code snippet is located. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[0][3][3]` is equal to `dp[0][2][3]`, `s` is 2, `k` is 3, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
