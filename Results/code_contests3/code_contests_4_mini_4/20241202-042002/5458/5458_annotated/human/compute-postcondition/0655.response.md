The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which remains zero, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
