The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into the 2D list `dp` using the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4. The expression `4 & 1` evaluates to 0 because in binary, 4 is `100` and 1 is `001`, and their bitwise AND results in `000`.
2. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.
3. The value of `k` is 4.

Now, we can substitute these values into the expression:

- `dp[0][3][4] = dp[0][2][4]`

This means that the value at index `[0][3][4]` in the `dp` list is set to the value at index `[0][2][4]`. 

The values of `s`, `M`, and the specific contents of the `dp` list are not provided, so we can't determine the exact values that are being assigned or modified. However, we do know that the state of `dp` changes at the specified indices.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices [0][3][4] and [0][2][4], `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 3, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [0][3][4] and [0][2][4], `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 3, `j` is 2**
