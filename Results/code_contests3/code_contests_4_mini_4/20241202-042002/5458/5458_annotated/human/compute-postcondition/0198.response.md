According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s`. Since the loop has executed until `k = 2` in the last iteration, for it to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`.**
