Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is modified with the value of `dp[0][j][3 - j] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain as `i` is 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.***
