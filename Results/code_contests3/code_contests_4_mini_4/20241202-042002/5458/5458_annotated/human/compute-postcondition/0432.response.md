Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
