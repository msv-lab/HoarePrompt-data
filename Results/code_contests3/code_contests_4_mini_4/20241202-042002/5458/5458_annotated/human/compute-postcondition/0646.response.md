The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we're currently in.
