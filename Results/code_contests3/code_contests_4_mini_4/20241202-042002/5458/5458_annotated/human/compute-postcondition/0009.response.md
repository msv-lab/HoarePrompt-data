According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `dp` is initialized but does not influence the loop execution directly. The loop variable `k` will start at 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is initialized to 1. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
