The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the 2D list `dp`. Here, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` results in 1. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to 1. Thus, the first index for `dp` is 1. The variable `k` is 4, which is directly used as the third index. However, the variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its impact on the output state.

Thus, the state of the variable `dp` is updated at `dp[1][j + 1][4] = 1`, but since `j` is not defined, we cannot specify its value.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; `i` is 0, `k` is 4, `j` is undefined**
