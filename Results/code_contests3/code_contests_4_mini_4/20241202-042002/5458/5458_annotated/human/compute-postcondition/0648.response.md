Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we're currently in; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
