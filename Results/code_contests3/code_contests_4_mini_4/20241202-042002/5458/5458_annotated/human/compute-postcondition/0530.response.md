Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 3, `j` is greater than 3, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state as there is no else part.***
