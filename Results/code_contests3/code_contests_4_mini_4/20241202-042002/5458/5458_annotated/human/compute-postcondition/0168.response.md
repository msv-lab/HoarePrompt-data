The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigning the value from one index of the `dp` list to another index. The dimensions of `dp` are (2, M + 2), and `k` is 4. The specific indices used in the assignment depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and the bitwise operation `&`.

Since `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 based on the parity of `i + 1`, and `j + 1` will yield a value in the range of the second dimension of `dp`, we can conclude that:

- The left side (`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`) will either point to `dp[0][j + 1][4]` or `dp[1][j + 1][4]` based on `i`.
- The right side (`dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`) will either refer to `dp[0][j][4]` or `dp[1][j][4]` based on the same condition.

The output state does not change the values of `s`, `k`, or `dp`, but it affects the specific indices in the `dp` structure based on the current `i` and `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 4; and a value is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][4]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][4]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 4; and a value is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][4]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][4].**
