Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
