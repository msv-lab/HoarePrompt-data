The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 2, `i` is `m + 2`, where `m` is at least 1, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
