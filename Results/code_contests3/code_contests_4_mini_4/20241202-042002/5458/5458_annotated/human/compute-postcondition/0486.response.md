According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `k` and the range defined by `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, as the loop iterates from 1 to `s` inclusive. 

Before the loop starts, `k` is already initialized to `s`, which means that `k` should be 1 for the first execution of the loop. Additionally, since `i` remains as 2 and `j` is at least `s + 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is also set correctly in relation to `s`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need `s` to be at least 1, `k` initialized to 1, `i` remains as 2, and `j` should be at least 2 (if `s` is 1, then `j` can be 2). 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `k` is 1, `i` remains as 2, `j` is at least 2, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
