The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

First, we need to compute the values of the indices:
- `i = m + 2` (where `m` is at least 1, so `i` is at least 3),
- `j = 2`,
- `k = 3`.

Next, we evaluate `i + 1 & 1`:
- Since `i` is at least 3, `i + 1` is at least 4. 
- In binary, `4` is `100`, and `1` is `001`. The expression `4 & 1` results in `0`.

Thus, the index for `dp` becomes:
- `dp[0][j + 1][k]` which translates to `dp[0][3][3]`,
- `dp[0][j][k]` which translates to `dp[0][2][3]`.

The assignment updates `dp[0][3][3]` with the value from `dp[0][2][3]`. Other variables and the state of the `dp` list are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, specifically `dp[0][3][3]` is now equal to `dp[0][2][3]`; `s` is 2, `k` is 3, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 2.**
