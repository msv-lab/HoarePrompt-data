Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is at least 3; `i` is 3; `j` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the code does not execute and `dp` remains unchanged.***
