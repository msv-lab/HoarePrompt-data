In the provided code snippet, the value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Here, `i` is `s + 1`, `j` is at least `1`, and `k` is equal to `s`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will calculate the value of `i + 1` first. Given that `i = s + 1`, it will be `s + 2`. The bitwise AND operation with `1` will yield either `0` or `1` depending on whether `s + 2` is even or odd. 

2. `j + 1` will be at least `2` since `j` is at least `1`.

3. The value of `k` remains `s`.

Thus, the updated state of `dp` will be determined by the specific values of `s`, which affects the indexing via `i`, `j`, and `k`, but the specific values of `M` and `s` are not provided. However, we can conclude that `dp` at the calculated indices will now hold a value of `1`.

The final output state reflects that `dp` has been updated at the specified index based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with value 1**
