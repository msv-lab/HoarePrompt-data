The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than 3, `k` is 3, and `s` must be at least 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
