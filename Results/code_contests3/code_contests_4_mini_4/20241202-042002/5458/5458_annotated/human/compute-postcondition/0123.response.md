According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and `s` is at least 1. This means that the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s` after the increment.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1, making `k` equal to 3. Additionally, for the loop to be able to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3**
