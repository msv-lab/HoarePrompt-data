Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; and `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while other variables remain unchanged.***
