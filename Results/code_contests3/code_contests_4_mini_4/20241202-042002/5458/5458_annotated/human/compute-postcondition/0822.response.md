The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop that the program is in. Since the values of `dp`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this statement, the output state remains the same, indicating that we are continuing with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][4][3] to the value of `dp[1][3][3]`; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` remains 2; `j` remains 3 and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
