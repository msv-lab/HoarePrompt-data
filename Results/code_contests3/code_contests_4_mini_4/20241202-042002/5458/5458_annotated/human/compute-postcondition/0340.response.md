Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged because the loop does not execute further.***
