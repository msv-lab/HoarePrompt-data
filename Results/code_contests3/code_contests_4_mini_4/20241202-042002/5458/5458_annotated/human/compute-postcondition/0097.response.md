According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. If `k` is less than `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3**
