According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and it is necessary for `s` to be at least 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
