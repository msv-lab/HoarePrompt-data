The code `continue` is executed, which means that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin. The values of the variables `dp`, `k`, and `s` do not change during this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the values of `dp`, `k`, and `s`, while indicating that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be at least 2; we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
