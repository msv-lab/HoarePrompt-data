Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is at least 2; `i` is 3; `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than `k`, `dp[0][3][k]` is updated by adding `dp[1][2][k - 2] % mod` to it; `i` remains 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is at least 2.***
