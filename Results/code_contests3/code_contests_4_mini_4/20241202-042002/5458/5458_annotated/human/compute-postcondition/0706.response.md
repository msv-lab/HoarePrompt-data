The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and an unknown value from the previous state of `dp`. 

1. `i` is equal to `1`, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `0`.
2. `j` is equal to `s + 2`, so `j + 1` results in `s + 3`.
3. `k` is equal to `s + 1`, so `k - j` results in `s + 1 - (s + 2) = -1`.
4. `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` translates to `dp[1 & 1][s + 2][-1]`, which means it accesses `dp[1][s + 2][-1]`.
5. The value from `dp[1][s + 2][-1]` is added to `dp[0][s + 3][s + 1]`.

Since `s` is at least `1`, the indices in the `dp` array will be valid, but the value at `dp[1][s + 2][-1]` is unknown. The output state reflects the update made to `dp`.

Output State: **`dp[0][s + 3][s + 1]` is updated based on `dp[1][s + 2][-1] % mod`**
