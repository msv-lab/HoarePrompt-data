Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` while continuing to the next iteration of the loop.***
