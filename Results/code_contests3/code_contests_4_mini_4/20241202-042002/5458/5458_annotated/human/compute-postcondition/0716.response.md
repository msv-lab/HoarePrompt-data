Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][s + 3][s + 1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][s + 3][s + 1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, utilizing previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
