The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` list at the indices calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals `1`. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` results in `2`. The value of `k` is not specified, but we use it directly in the index. 

The impact of this line is that the element at `dp[1][2][k]` is set to `1`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1.**
