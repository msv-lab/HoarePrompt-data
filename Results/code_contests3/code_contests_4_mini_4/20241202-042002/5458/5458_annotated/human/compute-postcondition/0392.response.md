The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 2`, and `k` is 1, we can evaluate the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `2 & 1`, which results in `0` (since 2 in binary is `10` and 1 is `01`, performing a bitwise AND results in `00`).
- `j + 1` evaluates to `(m + 2) + 1`, which is `m + 3`.
- `k` remains `1`.

Thus, the assignment can be rewritten as:

```
dp[0][m + 3][1] = dp[0][m + 2][1]
```

This means that the value at `dp[0][m + 3][1]` is set to whatever value is currently at `dp[0][m + 2][1]`. The states of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `i` is 1; `j` is m + 2; `k` is 1; `dp[0][m + 3][1]` is set to `dp[0][m + 2][1]**.
