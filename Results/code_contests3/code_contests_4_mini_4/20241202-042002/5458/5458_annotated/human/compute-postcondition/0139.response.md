The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after taking it modulo `mod`. The initial state indicates that `dp` has been updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `k` is 4. The value of `s` is at least 4, but `s` does not directly affect the computation in this snippet. 

The value `k - j` must be non-negative for the indexing to be valid, but without specific values for `j`, we cannot determine whether `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is valid or what its value is. Therefore, we can only state that the operation occurs based on the current indices.

The output state reflects the update applied to `dp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the value from [i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on the value from [i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
