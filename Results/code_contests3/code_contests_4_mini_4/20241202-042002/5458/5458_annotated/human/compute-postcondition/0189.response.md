According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`, and for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
