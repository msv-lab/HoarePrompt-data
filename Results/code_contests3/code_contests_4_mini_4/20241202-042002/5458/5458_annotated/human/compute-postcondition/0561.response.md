The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` computes the result based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1` will be at least 1, and therefore, `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is odd or even. The variables `j` and `k` are also involved, with `j` being greater than `k`. The previous values of `dp` at the indices are affected, but the details about `M`, `j`, and `k` are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes without exact numerical results.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
