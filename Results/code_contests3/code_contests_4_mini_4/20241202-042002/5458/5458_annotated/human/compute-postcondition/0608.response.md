Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to the variables.***
