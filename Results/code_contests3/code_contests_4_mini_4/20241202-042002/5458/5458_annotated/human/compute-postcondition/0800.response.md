Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is equal to 1; `i` is now 2; `j` is 3; and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` has a value of 1, then `s` remains at least 1, `k` remains 1, `i` remains 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no action taken in the else part.***
