Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % `mod`; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged.***
