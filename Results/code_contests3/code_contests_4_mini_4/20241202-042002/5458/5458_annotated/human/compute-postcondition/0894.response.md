Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 3; `i` is m + 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][3][0] % mod`, and the conditions of `s`, `k`, `m`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
