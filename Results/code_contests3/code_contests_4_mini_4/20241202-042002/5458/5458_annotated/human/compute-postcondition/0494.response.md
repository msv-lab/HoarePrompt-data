The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is 1; `i` is 2; `j` is at least 2; `s` is at least 1; and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1]`. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `k` is 1; `i` is 2; `j` is at least 2; `s` is at least 1; and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1]` and we skip the current iteration.**
