Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains (S + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the else case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The loop can execute a third time only if `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.***
