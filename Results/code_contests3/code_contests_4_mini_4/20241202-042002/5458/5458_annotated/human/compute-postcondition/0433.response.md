According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented. Since `s` is at least 1, the next value of `k` would be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
