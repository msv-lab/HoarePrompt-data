Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][2][k]` is updated with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][1][k]`, while `s` remains at least 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1. The loop does not execute again as `k` is already out of range.***
