Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the state of `dp`.***
