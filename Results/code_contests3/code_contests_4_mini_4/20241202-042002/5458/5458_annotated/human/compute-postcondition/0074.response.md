According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit set by `m`. The loop is designed to iterate for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at the last value it took before the loop ended. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

Given that the loop runs while `j` is less than or equal to `m`, if the last value of `j` was `m`, then for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `m`, which is not possible. However, if `j` was less than `m`, it would mean `j` can be incremented and the loop can run again.

Thus, if we assume `j` was less than `m` at the end of the previous iteration, we increment `j` by 1, making it `j + 1`. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `j + 1` and `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
