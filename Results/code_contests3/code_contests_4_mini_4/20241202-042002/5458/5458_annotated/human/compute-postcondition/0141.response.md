Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is `s`; depending on the values of `i` and `j`, the entries in `dp` will be updated based on the conditions set in the loop. Specifically, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` will be updated using the values from previous indices. The final `dp` array will reflect the results of these updates across all iterations of the loop.**
