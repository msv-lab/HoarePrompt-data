Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value, while the states of `dp`, `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
