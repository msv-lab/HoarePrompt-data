Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is equal to `s + 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated at the position determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k` with the value from the position `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, and `k`; otherwise, no updates occur to `dp` and the state remains unchanged.***
