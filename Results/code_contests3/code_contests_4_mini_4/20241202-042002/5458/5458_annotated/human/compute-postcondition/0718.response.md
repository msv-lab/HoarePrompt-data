The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the 2D list `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `1` or `0` depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is `0`, `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` is `1`. If `i` is `1`, `i + 1` is `2`, and `2 & 1` is `0`. Thus the first index will be either `0` or `1`. 

The second index `j + 1` will always evaluate to `s + 3` since `j` is `s + 2`.

The third index is simply `k`, which is `1`.

Since `k` is equal to `1`, we are accessing `dp[i + 1 & 1][s + 3][1]` and setting it to `1`. The values of `dp` will be altered at that specific index.

The output state can be summarized as follows, noting that the specific value of `dp` at the modified index is now `1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at index [i + 1 & 1][s + 3][1] to 1; `s` is at least 1; `k` is equal to 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is equal to `s + 2.**
