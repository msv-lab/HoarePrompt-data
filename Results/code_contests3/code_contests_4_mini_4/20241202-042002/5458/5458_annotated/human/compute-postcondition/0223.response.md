Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and if `i` is 0, then `dp[1][j + 1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` only if `j` is greater than `k`, which it is not in this case, so there are no changes made to `dp`.***
