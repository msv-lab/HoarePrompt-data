Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` remains 2; `j` remains 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to `1`; otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
