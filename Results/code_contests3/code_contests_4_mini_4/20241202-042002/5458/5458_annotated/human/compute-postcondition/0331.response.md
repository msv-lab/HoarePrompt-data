Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, `dp[1][2][k]` remains unchanged. If `i` is not 0, `dp[0][2][k]` is modified by adding `dp[1][1][k - 1] % mod`, `i` is set to 1, `j` is set to 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.***
