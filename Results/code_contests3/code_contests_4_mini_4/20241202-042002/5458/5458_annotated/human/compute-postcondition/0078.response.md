The value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, we have `i + 1` as `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to `1`, so `j + 1` will also be at least `2`. The variable `k` is `1`. 

Thus, the operation modifies the element at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`. Other variables (`s`, `k`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
