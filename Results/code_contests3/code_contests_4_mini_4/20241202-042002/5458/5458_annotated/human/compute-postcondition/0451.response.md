Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least s (final value of s after the loop), and `k` is s (final value of k after the loop). The values in `dp` are updated based on the conditions of the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or modified according to `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` otherwise.**
