According to the code, the loop iterates with the variable `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, meaning that the loop has executed once. To execute again, `k` must now be 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is still satisfied since `s` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
