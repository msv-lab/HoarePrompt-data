The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array. The value of `i` can be either 0 or 1, and `j` is 2, while `k` is 3. 

- When `i` is 0: 
  - `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
  - `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
  - Thus, `dp[1][3][3]` is set to `1`.

- When `i` is 1:
  - `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `2 & 1`, which is `0`.
  - `j + 1` still evaluates to `3`.
  - Thus, `dp[0][3][3]` is set to `1`.

Since both cases modify the `dp` list at different indices, the output state will reflect these changes. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is modified at `dp[1][3][3]` = 1 and `dp[0][3][3]` = 1; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 2**
