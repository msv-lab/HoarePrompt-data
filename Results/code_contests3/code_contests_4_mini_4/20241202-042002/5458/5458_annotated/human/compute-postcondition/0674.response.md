Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `i` is 1, then `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]` and `dp[2][3][1]` is updated to `dp[2][2][1] % mod`.***
