Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1); `k` is 2. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i == 0` and `j` is not greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` retains its previous value. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is not greater than `k`.***
