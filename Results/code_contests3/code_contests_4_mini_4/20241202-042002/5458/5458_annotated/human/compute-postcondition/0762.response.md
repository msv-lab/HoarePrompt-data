According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 1. After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is the total number of iterations executed; `k` is equal to `s`; `i` is `s + 1`; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2.**
