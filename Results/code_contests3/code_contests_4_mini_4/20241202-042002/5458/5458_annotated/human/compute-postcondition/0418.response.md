According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing computed values, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2.**
