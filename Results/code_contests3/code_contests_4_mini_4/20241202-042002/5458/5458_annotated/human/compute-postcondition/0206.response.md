Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and `j` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is updated at index [0][j + 1][3] to 1. If `j` is less than 3, there are no updates made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
