The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the 2D list `dp`. 

- The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
- The value of `j` is not specified, but it is being incremented by 1 (`j + 1`).
- The value of `k` is 4, and `k - j` will depend on the current value of `j`.

Assuming that for the current values `j` is less than or equal to `k` (which is necessary to avoid index errors when accessing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`), then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` to it.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index [1][j + 1][k], `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][j + 1][k], `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 0**
