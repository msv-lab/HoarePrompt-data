Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is 2, `k` is 3, `i` is `m + 2`, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][3]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding `dp[1][2][1] % mod`, with `s` remaining 2, `k` remaining 3, `i` being at least 3, and `j` being 2.***
