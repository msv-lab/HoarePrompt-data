According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `s`, which means `j` could be equal to `s` or more, but for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `m` (inclusive), if `j` is at least `s` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become at least `s + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least `s + 1` to ensure that `j` can take on that value.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least `s`, `k` is at most `s`, `j` is at least `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be at least `s + 1`**
