Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) where each inner list contains values that depend on the specific values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and the previous state of `dp`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then for each `k` from 1 to `s`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated to 1. If `i` is not 0, the values in `dp` will represent the accumulation of possible combinations based on the conditions in the loop, leveraging previous states of `dp` as defined by the conditions of `j` and `k`, with each `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` updated accordingly with mod applied where necessary.**
