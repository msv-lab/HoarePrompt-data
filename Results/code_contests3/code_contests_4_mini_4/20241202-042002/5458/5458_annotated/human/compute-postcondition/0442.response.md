According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 3.

Since the loop execution depends on `k` being less than or equal to `s`, and we know that `s` is at least 2, the conditions for the next iteration imply that `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again after `k` is incremented.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
