According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2. Since `k` is equal to `s`, it means `k` must also be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Additionally, `i` is set to `s + 1`, so if `s` is at least 2, then `i` will be at least 3. Before the loop starts, `j` is initialized to 2, which is suitable for the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute the second time, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2, `k` is also at least 2, `i` is 3 (since `s` is 2), and `j` remains 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is at least 2; `i` is 3; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2**
