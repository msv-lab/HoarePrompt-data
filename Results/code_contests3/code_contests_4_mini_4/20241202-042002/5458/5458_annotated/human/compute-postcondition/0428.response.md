The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is modified at dp[1][j + 1][1] to dp[1][j][1], `i` is 2, `m` is at least 1, `j` is greater than 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
