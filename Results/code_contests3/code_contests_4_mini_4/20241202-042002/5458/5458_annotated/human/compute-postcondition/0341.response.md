According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value (which is 1 less than the next value it will take), and `s` must be greater than or equal to that value for the loop to execute another time.

Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, after the last iteration where `k` was at its last value, `k` will increment by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1), for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2.**
