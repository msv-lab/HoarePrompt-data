Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `k` during execution. If `i` is not 0, `dp` is updated based on the values from the previous states, specifically using `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `k` has been incremented as needed and `j` is the final value after all iterations.**
