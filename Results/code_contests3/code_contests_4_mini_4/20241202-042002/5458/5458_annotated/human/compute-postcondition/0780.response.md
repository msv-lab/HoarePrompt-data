The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `k` is at least 3; `s` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
