According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `i` is equal to 0**
