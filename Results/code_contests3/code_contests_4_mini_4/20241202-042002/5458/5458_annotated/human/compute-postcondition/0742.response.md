Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1][j + 1][k]` with value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no updates are made to `dp`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by that same value, while `j` remains greater than `k`.***
