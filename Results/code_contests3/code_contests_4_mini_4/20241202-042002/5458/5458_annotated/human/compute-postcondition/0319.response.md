According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, which are suitable initial values. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be greater than 0 and `s` must be at least 1 to ensure that the range for `k` is valid.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
