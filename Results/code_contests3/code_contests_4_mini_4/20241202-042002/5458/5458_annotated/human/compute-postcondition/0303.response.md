The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is updated where `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][3]`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
