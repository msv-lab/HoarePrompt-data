Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, and `i` is m + 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
