Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`, while all other variable values remain unchanged.***
