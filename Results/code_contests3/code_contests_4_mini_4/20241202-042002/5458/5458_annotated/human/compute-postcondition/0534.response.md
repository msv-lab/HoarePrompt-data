According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take a value greater than its current value and still remain less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute, we can determine that for the loop to run again, `s` must be at least 4 after incrementing `k`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4, and `k` is incremented by 1.**
