The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Since `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is zero (as stated in the initial state), the calculation for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` must be evaluated. However, the initial state does not provide information on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, which could be either zero or some value. The impact of this operation depends on that unknown value.

Thus, the output state reflects the uncertainty based on the unknown value in `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) containing zeros; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on an unknown value in `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` which could be zero or some value.**
