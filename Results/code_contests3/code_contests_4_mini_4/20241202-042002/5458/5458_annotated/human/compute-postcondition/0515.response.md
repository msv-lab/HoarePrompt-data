The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and the modulo operation. The specific values of `M`, `mod`, and the current indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` is 3. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects the update made to `dp`: 
`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
