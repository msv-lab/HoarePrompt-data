The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
