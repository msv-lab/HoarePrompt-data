Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, and `i` is equal to m + 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged at unspecified values, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
