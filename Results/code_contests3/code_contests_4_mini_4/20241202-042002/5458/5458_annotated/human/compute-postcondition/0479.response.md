Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration.**
