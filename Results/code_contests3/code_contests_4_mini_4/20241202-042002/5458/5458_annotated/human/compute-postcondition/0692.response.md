Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` and `dp[0][3][3]` are both set to 1. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][2][1] % mod`. In all cases, `s` is at least 3 and `k` is 3.***
