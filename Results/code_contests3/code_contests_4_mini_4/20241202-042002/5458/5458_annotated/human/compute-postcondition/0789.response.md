The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices [0][3][4] and [0][2][4], `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `i` is 3, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
