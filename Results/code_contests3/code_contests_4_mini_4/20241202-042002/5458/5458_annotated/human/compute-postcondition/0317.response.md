According to the code, whether the for loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n^2` times. If `n` is 0, then `n^2` will also be 0, and the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. 

Additionally, since `i` is initialized as `n^2`, it will also need to be adjusted accordingly. For the loop to execute for the first time, `i` will start at 0, provided `n` is at least 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1); `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
