Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2) filled with lists containing [0] * (s + 1). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, modifying the specific elements of the 2D list `dp` based on the indices `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
