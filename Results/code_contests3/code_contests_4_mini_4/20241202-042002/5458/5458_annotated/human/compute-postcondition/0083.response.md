The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we're currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with the conditions that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with the conditions that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
