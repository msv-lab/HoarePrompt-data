According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its final value after all iterations, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` would be `m + 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); for the loop to execute a second time `j` is `m + 1` and `m` must be greater than or equal to `m + 1`**
