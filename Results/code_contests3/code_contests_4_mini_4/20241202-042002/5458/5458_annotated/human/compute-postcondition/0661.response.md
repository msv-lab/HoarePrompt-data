According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` starting from 1 up to `m`, inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has a certain value that is less than or equal to `m`. 

Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, we need to determine the current value of `j` at the end of the last iteration. The next value of `j` will be the current value of `j` plus 1.

Assuming `j` is currently some value `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq m\), then for the loop to execute again, `j` must be \(k + 1\), and this new value must still satisfy \(j \leq m\). Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to \(k + 1\).

In summary, if `j` is currently equal to `k`, then for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `j` to \(k + 1\) and ensure that \(m\) is at least \(k + 1\).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is the total number of iterations executed, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is \(k + 1\), for the loop to execute one more time `m` must be greater than or equal to \(k + 1\)**.
