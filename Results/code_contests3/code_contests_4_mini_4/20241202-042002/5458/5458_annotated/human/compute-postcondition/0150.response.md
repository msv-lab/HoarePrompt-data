The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `i + 1 & 1` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`, but since `i` is not equal to 0, it will result in either 1 or 0 based on whether `i` is odd or even. 

The variable `j` is greater than `k`, which means that `j + 1` is definitely greater than `k`. The assignment does not affect other variables. Therefore, the Output State encapsulates the assignment that has been made but does not specify exact values due to the abstract nature of `dp`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
