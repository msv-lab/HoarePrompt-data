Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `i` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1.***
