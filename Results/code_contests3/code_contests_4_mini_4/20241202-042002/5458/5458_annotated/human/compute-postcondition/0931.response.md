The code snippet prints the value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`. Here, `n ** 2 & 1` determines the first index for accessing the `dp` list, while `m + 1` provides the second index, and `s` is used for the third index. 

Given that:
- `i` is either `n^2 % 2`, which will yield either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `n^2`.
- `j` is `m + 1`, which is directly used as the second index.
- `s` remains the same as its last value.

The output will be computed based on the specific values of `n`, `m`, and the `dp` list's structure. However, since those specific numeric values are not provided in the initial state, the output is described in terms of the variables:

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); value printed is `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`.**
