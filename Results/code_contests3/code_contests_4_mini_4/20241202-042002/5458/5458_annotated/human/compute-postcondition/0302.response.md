The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` evaluates to 1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals 1. The variable `k` is 3. The code assigns the value from `dp[1][j][3]` to `dp[1][j + 1][3]`. The specific values of `j` and `M` are not provided, but the dimensions of `dp` are sufficient to accommodate the indices used. Therefore, the output state is based on the assignment made to the `dp` list.

Output State: **`dp` is updated where `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][3]`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0**
