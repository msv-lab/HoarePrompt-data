According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 3 and `s` is at least 2. Since the loop is set to iterate from 1 to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `k` is at least 3, for the next iteration, `k` will need to be 4, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4 (since the loop runs while `k` is less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2); `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; `i` is 3; `j` is 2**
