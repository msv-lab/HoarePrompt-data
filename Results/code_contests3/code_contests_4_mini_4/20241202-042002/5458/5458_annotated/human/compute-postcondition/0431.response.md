The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, which is affected by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The other variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
