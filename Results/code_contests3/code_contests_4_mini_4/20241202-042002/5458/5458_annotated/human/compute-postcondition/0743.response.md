According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, since `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `s + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`. Therefore, the next value of `k` will be `s + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, the state will need to reflect that `k` is now `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is `s + 1`, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
