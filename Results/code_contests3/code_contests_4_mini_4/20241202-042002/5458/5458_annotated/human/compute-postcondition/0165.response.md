According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relationship to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 2. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

Since the loop variable `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased to 4. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (2, M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 4**
