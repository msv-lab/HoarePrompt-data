n is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), s is an integer representing the number of the top floor (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and each passenger is represented by a pair of integers (fi, ti) where fi is the floor number (1 ≤ fi ≤ s) and ti is the time of arrival in seconds (1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000).
