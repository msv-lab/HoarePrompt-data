According to the code, the loop iterates based on the range defined by `n + 1`. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 101, which means the loop has already executed 102 times (from 0 to 101 inclusive). Since `n` is supposed to be an integer between 1 and 100, this indicates that the loop has exceeded its intended range.

For the loop to potentially execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 102. However, since `n` is capped at 100, the condition for the loop to execute again (i.e., `i` must be less than or equal to `n`) cannot be satisfied as `101 > 100`.

Therefore, there are no adjustments that can be made to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 101; the loop cannot execute again as `i` exceeds `n`.**
