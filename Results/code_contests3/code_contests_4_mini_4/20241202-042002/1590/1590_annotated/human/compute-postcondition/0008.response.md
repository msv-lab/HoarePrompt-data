According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, which means `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
