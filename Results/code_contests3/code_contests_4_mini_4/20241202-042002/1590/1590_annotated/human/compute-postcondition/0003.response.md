The code snippet assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. Since the variables `fi` and `ti` are not previously defined in the initial state, they will now hold the values provided by the user input. The values of `n`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `fi` and `ti` are assigned input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `fi` and `ti` are assigned input integers**
