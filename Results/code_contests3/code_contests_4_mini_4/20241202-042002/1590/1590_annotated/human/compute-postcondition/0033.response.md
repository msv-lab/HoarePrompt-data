The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, constrained to the range 1 to 100. The parameter `s` is an integer representing the number of the top floor, constrained to the range 1 to 1000. Additionally, each passenger is represented by a pair of integers `(fi, ti)`, where `fi` is the floor number constrained to the range 1 to `s`, and `ti` is the time of arrival in seconds constrained to the range 1 to 1000.

The function does not return any specific values in the provided description, so we cannot determine the exact output behavior. However, based on the context, it likely processes the information about passengers and their respective floors and times.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of passengers and an integer `s` representing the number of the top floor. Each passenger is represented by a pair of integers (fi, ti), where fi is the floor number and ti is the time of arrival.**
