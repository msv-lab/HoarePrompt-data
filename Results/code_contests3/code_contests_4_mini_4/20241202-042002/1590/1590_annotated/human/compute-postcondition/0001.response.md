The code initializes an empty list `p`. The previous values of the affected variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they do not impact the assignment of `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `s` is an integer representing the number of the top floor (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000); `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `s` is an integer representing the number of the top floor (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000); `p` is an empty list.**
