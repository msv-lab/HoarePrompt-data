According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

Since `i` is currently 0, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
