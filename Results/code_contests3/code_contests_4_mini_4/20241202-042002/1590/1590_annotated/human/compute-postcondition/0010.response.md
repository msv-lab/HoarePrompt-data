The code `p.append((fi, ti))` appends a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are not defined in the initial state, but they are specified as input integers. The variable `n`, which is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `i`, which is 2, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes the state of `n`, `i`, and the updated list `p` which now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `p` now contains the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
