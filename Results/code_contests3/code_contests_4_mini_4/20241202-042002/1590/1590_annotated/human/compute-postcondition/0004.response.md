`p` is updated to include a new tuple `(fi, ti)`, where `fi` and `ti` are input integers. The previous state of `p` was an empty list, so after the execution, `p` will contain one tuple with the values of `fi` and `ti`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is a list containing the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is a list containing the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
