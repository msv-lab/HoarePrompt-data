In this case, the code snippet `p.append((fi, ti))` appends a tuple consisting of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The variables `fi` and `ti` are already assigned integer values from the input. The variable `p` must be a list (though not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, it's implied since we are using the `append` method). The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state will indicate the values of `fi` and `ti` being appended to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1; `p` has a new element appended: (fi, ti)**
