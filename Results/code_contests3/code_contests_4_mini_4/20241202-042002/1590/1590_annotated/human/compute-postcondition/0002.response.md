According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 before the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` should be greater than or equal to 1, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `p` can remain an empty list since it does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be at least 1**
