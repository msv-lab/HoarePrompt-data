The variable `time_passed` is incremented by the difference of `p[i][1]` and `time_passed`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, we can use this relationship to determine the new value of `time_passed`. The previous condition states that the time passed is less than `p[n][1]`. 

Since `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]` (which is `p[n][1]`) minus the current `time_passed`, the output state can be expressed as follows. The specific values of `p[n][1]` and `time_passed` are not provided, but we know the relationship.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`, and `time_passed` is updated based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `s` is assigned the value of `p[n][0]`, and `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[n][1] - time_passed`.**
