The loop iterates `n` times, where in each iteration it reads a pair of integers `(fi, ti)` and appends it as a tuple to the list `p`. At the end of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `p` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the `(fi, ti)` pairs provided as inputs.

If `n` is 1, `p` will have one tuple. If `n` is 100, `p` will have 100 tuples. The values of `fi` and `ti` will be the last pair read in the final iteration, but `p` will contain all pairs provided during the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form `(fi, ti)` where each tuple corresponds to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.**
