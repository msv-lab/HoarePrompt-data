In this case, the code snippet `time_passed += s - p[i][0]` attempts to execute an operation involving the variables `time_passed`, `s`, and `p[i][0]`. However, since `i` is 101 and cannot be used as an index for `p` (given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100), the operation cannot be performed. The values of the variables do not change as the loop cannot execute again due to the condition that `i` exceeds `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 101; the loop cannot execute again as `i` exceeds `n`, and no changes occur.**
