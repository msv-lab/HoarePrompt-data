The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, which splits the input string into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 and does not directly affect `fi` and `ti`, their values will depend solely on the input. The previous values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
