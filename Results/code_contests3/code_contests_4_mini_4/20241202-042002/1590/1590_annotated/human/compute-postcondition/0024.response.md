In the provided code snippet, `time_passed` is updated according to the formula `time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed`. The variable `i` is 101, and thus we need to evaluate `p[101][1]`. The value of `time_passed` does not change during this operation since the previous values of `p` and `time_passed` are not provided.

This means the output state should reflect the unchanged `time_passed` along with the operation executed on it. The impact is that `time_passed` will be modified based on the value of `p[101][1]`, but we cannot determine what that value is.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 101, `s` is assigned the value of `p[101][0]`, and `time_passed` is updated but remains unchanged overall as we do not have the exact value of `p[101][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 101, `s` is assigned the value of `p[101][0]`, and `time_passed` is updated but remains unchanged overall.**
