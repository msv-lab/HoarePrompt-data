Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of passengers, and an integer `s`, representing the number of the top floor. It reads the floor numbers and arrival times of each passenger, calculates the total time taken to reach each passenger's floor starting from the top floor, and adjusts the total time based on the arrival time of each passenger. It then prints the total time passed, which includes the time taken to travel between floors and any necessary waiting time for passengers. **
