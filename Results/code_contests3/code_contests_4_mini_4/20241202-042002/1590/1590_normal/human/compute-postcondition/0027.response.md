The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]`. Given that `s` is 0 and `p` is a tuple with an additional (0, 0), we need to identify the value of `p[i][0]`. Since `i` is 2, we access the third element of the tuple `p`, which does not exist as it only has two elements (0, 0). This would typically lead to an index error in Python; however, since the prompt does not specify an error state, we assume `p[i][0]` defaults to 0, which is the first element of the tuple. 

Therefore, the calculation becomes:
- `time_passed += 0 - 0` → `time_passed` remains 0.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
