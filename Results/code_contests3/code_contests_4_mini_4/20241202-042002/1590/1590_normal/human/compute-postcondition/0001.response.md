The variable `p` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged since this line of code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and `p` is an empty list.**
