`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values resulting from splitting the input into two integers. Since these values are taken from the input, their exact values are unknown, but they are integers. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `fi` and `ti`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are the integers from input, `p` has an element (fi, ti) appended to it for the loop to execute a second time if `n` is greater than 1.**
