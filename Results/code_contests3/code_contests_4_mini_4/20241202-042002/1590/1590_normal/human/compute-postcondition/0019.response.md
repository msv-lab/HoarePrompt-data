The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. Given that `time_passed` is initially `s` (which is 0) and `p` contains a tuple (0, 0), we have `p[i][1]` equal to 0. Therefore, the calculation becomes:

`time_passed += 0 - 0`, which results in `time_passed` remaining 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
