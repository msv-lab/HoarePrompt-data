According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
