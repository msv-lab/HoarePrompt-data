To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `s` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0)
- `time_passed` is 0

Code Snippet:
```
time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The current value of `i` is 1.
2. `p[i]` refers to the tuple `p[1]`. However, the provided initial state indicates that `p` contains only one tuple (0, 0), which implies `p` is likely something like `p = [(0, 0)]`. Therefore, accessing `p[1]` would lead to an error in a real execution since it is out of bounds, but we will analyze it as if it were correctly set up.
3. Assuming `p[i]` corresponds to a valid tuple and if we consider the tuple at `p[1]` to be (0, 0) for the sake of this analysis, then `p[i][1]` would be `0`.
4. The calculation then becomes:  
   `time_passed += 0 - time_passed`  
   This simplifies to:  
   `time_passed = time_passed + 0 - time_passed`  
   Which results in `time_passed = 0`.

The value of `time_passed` remains unchanged at 0. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`, and `p`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is 0, `i` is 1, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**.
