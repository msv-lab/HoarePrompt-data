The variable `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `s` will take the value of the first element of the tuple at index 1 of `p`. The value of `p` is `(0, 0)`, so `p[1]` does not exist. Assuming `p` is an indexable collection of tuples, attempting to access `p[1][0]` would lead to an IndexError if `p` is not long enough. However, since the problem does not specify an error, we will consider the tuple at `p[1]` to be (0, 0) for this scenario.

Thus, `s` becomes `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is 0, `i` is 1, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**.
