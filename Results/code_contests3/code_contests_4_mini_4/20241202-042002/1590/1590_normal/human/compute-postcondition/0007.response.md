The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. Since `fi` and `ti` are provided as inputs, their specific values are not known. However, the list `p` will contain one additional element after this operation. The values of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged, and there are no other impacts.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are the integers from input, `p` contains one more element (fi, ti) appended to it.**
