The code appends the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are input integers, but they are not provided as specific values in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `p` is updated with a new tuple consisting of the input integers `fi` and `ti`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer, `p` is updated with the tuple (fi, ti)**
