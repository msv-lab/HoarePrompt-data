According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. Since `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input split into two integers, and `p` has an element (fi, ti) appended to it for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
