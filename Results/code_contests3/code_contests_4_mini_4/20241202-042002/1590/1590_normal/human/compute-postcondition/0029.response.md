To analyze the code snippet provided, we need to focus on the line of code and how it interacts with the current state of the variables.

1. **Current State of Variables**:
   - `n` is an integer in the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - `s` is 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `p` is a tuple that has at least 3 elements since `i` is 2 (the third element is accessed).
   - `time_passed` is 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed` modifies `time_passed`.
   - First, `p[i][1]` is accessed. Given that `i` is 2, it retrieves the second element of the third element of the tuple `p`.
   - Since `time_passed` is initially 0, the equation simplifies to:
     ```
     time_passed = time_passed + (p[i][1] - 0)
     time_passed = p[i][1]
     ```

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variable `time_passed` will now hold the value of `p[i][1]`.
   - The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Since we do not have the actual values of `p` to compute the exact value of `time_passed`, we describe the state in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is now equal to `p[2][1]`.**
