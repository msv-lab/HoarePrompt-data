`p` has an additional tuple at index `i` which is `p[2]`. The value of `p[2][0]` is 0 (from the tuple (0, 0)). Therefore, `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, making `s` equal to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `time_passed`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is 0, `i` is 2, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
