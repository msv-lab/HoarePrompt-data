The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the output of `raw_input()`, which takes a string input and then splits it into two parts that are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `fi` and `ti` will hold the input integer values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**.
