Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is the last value of `p[n][0]`, `i` is `n`, `p` contains `n + 1` tuples, and `time_passed` is the maximum value among `p[i][1]` for all `i` from 0 to `n` if `time_passed` was less than that maximum during the loop execution, otherwise it remains the accumulated value from the loop.**
