The loop iterates `n` times, each time taking two integers from the input and appending them as a tuple to the list `p`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`, as it counts from `0` to `n - 1`. The list `p` will contain `n` tuples, each corresponding to the pairs of integers input during each iteration.

If `n` is equal to `1`, `p` will contain one tuple. If `n` is greater than `1`, `p` will contain `n` tuples, each filled with the respective input values for `fi` and `ti`.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations is that `n` remains an integer within its original bounds, `s` remains an integer within its bounds, `i` equals `n - 1`, and `p` contains `n` tuples of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers (fi, ti) from input.**
