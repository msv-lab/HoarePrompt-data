The code appends the tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The initial values of `n`, `s`, `i`, and the sorting order of `p` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is `n - 1`, and `p` now includes the additional tuple `(0, 0)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is `n - 1`, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0)**
