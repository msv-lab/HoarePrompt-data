According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive), which means it will iterate `n + 1` times. The initial value of `i` is `n - 1`, so it needs to be adjusted to the starting value of `0` for the loop to execute the first time. 

Additionally, the variable `n` must be within the range specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), but it is already given as such. The variable `s` does not affect the execution of the loop directly. The tuple `p` also does not impact the loop execution itself.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute the first time are that `i` needs to be set to `0`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 0, `p` has an additional tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
