According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The range function will generate values from 0 up to n-1. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which is already guaranteed by the condition (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Since `i` is used as the loop index, it will start at 0 during the first iteration. The integer `s` and the empty list `p` do not affect the execution of the loop itself; however, they may be relevant for the operations inside the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` is 1 or more, `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
