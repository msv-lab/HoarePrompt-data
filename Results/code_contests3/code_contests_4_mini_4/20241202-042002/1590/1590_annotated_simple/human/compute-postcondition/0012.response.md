The code sorts the list `p` in descending order based on the first element of each tuple (fi) using a lambda function as the key. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as does the count of tuples in `p`. The value of `i` is already equal to `n` after all iterations. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples, and `i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples, and `i` is equal to `n**
