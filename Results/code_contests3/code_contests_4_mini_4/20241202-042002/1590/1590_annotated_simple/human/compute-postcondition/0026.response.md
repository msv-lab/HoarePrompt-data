According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n`).

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
