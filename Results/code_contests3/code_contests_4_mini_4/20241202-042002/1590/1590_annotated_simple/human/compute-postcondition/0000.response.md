The code snippet updates the values of `n` and `s` by reading input from the user and converting it into integers. The values of `n` and `s` are reassigned based on the input received. The previous values of `n` and `s` are not known, but they must satisfy the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000). Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `s` is an integer representing the top floor number (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000)**
