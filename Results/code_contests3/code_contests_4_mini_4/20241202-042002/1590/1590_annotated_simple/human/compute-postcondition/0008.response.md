According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and since `i` will be incremented by 1, it will become 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
