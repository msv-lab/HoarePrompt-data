The code `p.append((fi, ti))` adds a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned input integers, but since they are not provided in the initial state, we cannot specify their exact values. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
