The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are determined by user input and are integers. The variable `n` is not directly affected, and `i` is also not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of list `p` after appending the tuple and the current values of `n`, `i`, `fi`, and `ti`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti)**
