The code initializes `p` as an empty list. The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged as this code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `s` is an integer representing the top floor number (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000); `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `s` is an integer representing the top floor number (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000); `p` is an empty list.**
