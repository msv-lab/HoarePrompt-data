The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference `p[i][1] - time_passed` to its previous value. Given that `i` is 1, we access the second element of the list `p`, which means we are looking at `p[1][1]`. The previous value of `time_passed` is updated by this calculation.

Since `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, and `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of the tuples, the specific values of `p[1][1]` and `time_passed` are not provided. Therefore, we will state the relationship between the variables.

The output state will reflect that `time_passed` is updated based on the value of `p[1][1]` and the previous value of `time_passed`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[1][1] - time_passed` to its previous value.**
