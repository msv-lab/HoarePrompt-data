Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of passengers and an integer `s` representing the top floor number. It takes input for each passenger's floor number `fi` and arrival time `ti`, processes this information to calculate the total time passed for the elevator to pick up all passengers, and prints the total time passed. The function does not return any value. Potential edge cases include ensuring that the arrival times are respected and that the floor numbers are properly processed even if they are the same.**
