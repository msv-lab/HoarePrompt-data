`p` is a list that is being appended with a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from the input, which has been split into integers. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected, and the only change is the addition of a new tuple to the list `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `p` now includes the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
