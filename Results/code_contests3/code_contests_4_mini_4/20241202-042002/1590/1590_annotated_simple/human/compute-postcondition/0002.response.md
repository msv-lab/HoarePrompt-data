According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers and must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we can conclude that `n` should be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` should be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
