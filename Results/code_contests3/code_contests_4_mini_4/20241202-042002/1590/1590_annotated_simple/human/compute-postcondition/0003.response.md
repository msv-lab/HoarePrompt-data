The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, and converting those parts into integers. The variables `fi` and `ti` are directly affected by this operation, while the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input as integers**
