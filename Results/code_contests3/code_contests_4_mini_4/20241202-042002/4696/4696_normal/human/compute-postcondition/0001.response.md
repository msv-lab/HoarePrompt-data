`n` is assigned the value `int(a)`, where `a` is taken from user input. The value of `n` is now determined by the input value of `a`, which must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and its previous value is still valid as it is based on another user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` is the input value assigned to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` is the input value assigned to `n**
