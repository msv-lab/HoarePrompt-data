Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is the input value assigned to `n`; `i` is updated to `i % f` after each iteration; `p` is an empty list after all elements from the range have been removed; `k` is `n`; `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(0)` which is 1; `d` is computed as `i // f`, which gives a unique index for each iteration.**
