To analyze the provided code snippet, we start with the initial state where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3), and `d` is i // f. The operation `print(p[d])` is executed before the line of code we are analyzing.

The line of code:
```
p.remove(p[d])
```
indicates that we are removing the element at index `d` from the list `p`. 

The output state will reflect that the variable `p` has been modified by removing the element at index `d`, but without knowing the specific contents of `p` prior to the removal or the value of `d`, we can only describe the change in general terms.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `d` is i // f; `p` has an element removed at index `d`.**
