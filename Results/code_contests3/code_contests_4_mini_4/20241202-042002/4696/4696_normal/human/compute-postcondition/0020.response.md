To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and initial state. 

1. We have `n` as a positive integer between 1 and 50.
2. `k` is set to 3.
3. `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - 3)`, which calculates the factorial of `n - 3`.
4. `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, where `i` is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code (not provided in the initial state).

The statement `print(p[d])` attempts to print the value at index `d` of the list or array `p`. The value of `d` depends on the value of `i` and `f`. Since `f` is computed from `n`, the output will vary based on those variables.

However, without specific values for `n`, `i`, and `p`, we cannot compute a precise output. Therefore, we can only describe the potential impact of the code.

The output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `d` is i // f; print(p[d]) is executed.**
