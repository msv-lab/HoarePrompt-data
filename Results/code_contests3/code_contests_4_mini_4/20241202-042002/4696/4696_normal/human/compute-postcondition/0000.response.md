The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which takes input as a string, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected, and since `a` and `b` depend on user input, their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions and the assignment of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input.**
