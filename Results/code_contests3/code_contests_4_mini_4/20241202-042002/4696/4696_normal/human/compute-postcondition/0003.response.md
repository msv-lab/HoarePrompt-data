The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since the previous value of `i` is known (it is the result of `int(b)`), we can conclude that `i` is now one less than its previous value. The values of `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` is the input value assigned to `n; `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` is the input value assigned to `n; `i` is decreased by 1.**
