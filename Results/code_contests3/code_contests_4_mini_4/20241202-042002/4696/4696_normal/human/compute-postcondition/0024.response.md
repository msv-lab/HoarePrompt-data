The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within constraints, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, with cntn being the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p). The function likely computes some output based on these constraints. However, since the function does not take parameters directly, it is assumed that the values for `n` and `m` are determined internally or set as global constants.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p).**
