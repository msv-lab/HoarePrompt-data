According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
