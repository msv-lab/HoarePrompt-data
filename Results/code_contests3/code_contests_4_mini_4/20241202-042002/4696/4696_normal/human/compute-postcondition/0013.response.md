To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet.

The code `d = i // f` assigns the value of `i // f` to `d`. However, we need to check the previous values of the affected variables, particularly `i` and `f`.

- `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 2)`, where `n` is a positive integer in the range between 1 and 50. The value of `f` will depend on `n`.
- The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot derive its value unless specified.

Since `i` is not given, we cannot compute `d` directly, and we only know that `f` will be a specific value based on `n`.

Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `d` without knowing `i`. The output state will reflect the known values and the fact that we are unable to compute `d` due to the unknown value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `i` is undefined; `d` cannot be computed without `i`.**
