According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 (the starting value of the loop) and for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 1, which it is since `n` is defined as a positive integer. After the first iteration, `k` will be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `n`**.
