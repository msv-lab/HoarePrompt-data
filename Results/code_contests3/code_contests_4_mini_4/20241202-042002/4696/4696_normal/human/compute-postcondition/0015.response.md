The operation `p.remove(p[d])` attempts to access `d`, which is currently undefined because it relies on the value of `i`, which is also undefined. As a result, attempting to access `p[d]` will cause an error. No variables are modified as the execution does not proceed past the error.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `i` is undefined; `d` cannot be computed without `i`; attempting to print `p[d]` results in an error due to `d` being undefined.**
