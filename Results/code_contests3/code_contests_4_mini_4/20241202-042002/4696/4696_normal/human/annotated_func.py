#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with the maximum possible value of f(p).
def func():
    a, b = raw_input().split()
    n = int(a)
    i = int(b)
    i = i - 1
    p = range(1, n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        f = factorial(n - k)
        
        d = i // f
        
        print(p[d]),
        
        p.remove(p[d])
        
        i = i % f
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is the input value assigned to `n`; `i` is updated to `i % f` after each iteration; `p` is an empty list after all elements from the range have been removed; `k` is `n`; `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(0)` which is 1; `d` is computed as `i // f`, which gives a unique index for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and calculates the permutation of integers from 1 to n based on the provided index i. It outputs the specific permutation corresponding to the index after computing the necessary factorial values and updating the index accordingly. The function assumes that n is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and i is an index for the permutations of that length. However, it does not handle cases where the input values do not meet these assumptions or if the index i exceeds the total number of permutations, which may lead to erroneous outputs.
