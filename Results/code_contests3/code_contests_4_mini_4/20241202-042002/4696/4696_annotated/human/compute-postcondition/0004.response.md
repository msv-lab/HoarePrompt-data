The variable `p` is assigned the value of `range(1, n + 1)`, which generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, the value of `p` will be a range object containing integers from 1 to `n`. The other variables `m`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings; `i` is `int(b) - 1; `p` is a range object from 1 to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings; `i` is `int(b) - 1; `p` is a range object from 1 to `n`.**
