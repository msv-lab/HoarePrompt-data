The value of `i` is updated by taking the modulus of `i` with `f`, which means `i` is assigned the value `i % f`. The previous value of `f` is unchanged, and `d` is still assigned the value `i // f`. The output state reflects the updated value of `i`, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`; `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`; `i` is updated to `i % f`.**
