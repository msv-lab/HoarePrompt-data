The variable `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is a part of the input string. The previous state of `b` is an input string, and its integer conversion will yield a positive integer, but the specific value is not provided. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and the newly assigned value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings from raw_input split into two parts; `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`.**
