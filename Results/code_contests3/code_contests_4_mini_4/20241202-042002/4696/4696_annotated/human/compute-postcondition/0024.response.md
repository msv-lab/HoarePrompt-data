The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in its definition. Instead, it operates based on the internal logic that involves two positive integers: `n` and `m`. The integer `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 50, inclusive. The integer `m` must be a positive integer that falls within the range of 1 to `cntn`, where `cntn` is the total number of permutations of length `n` that yield the maximum possible value of a function `f(p)`. 

The function, while not providing specific output details in the provided constraints and relationships, would typically return a result based on the calculations or operations performed internally, likely involving permutations.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn) and operates on these values to produce a result based on permutations of length n.**
