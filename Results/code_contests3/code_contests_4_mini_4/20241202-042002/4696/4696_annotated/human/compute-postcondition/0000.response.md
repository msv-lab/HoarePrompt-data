The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from `raw_input().split()`, which means they will hold the results of the input split into two parts. Since there is no information about the actual input values provided, we cannot determine the exact values for `a` and `b`. However, the initial conditions of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings from raw_input split into two parts.**
