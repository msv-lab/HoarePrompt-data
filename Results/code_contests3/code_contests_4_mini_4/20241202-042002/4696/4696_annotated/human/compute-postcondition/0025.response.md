The function `func` accepts two implicit parameters retrieved from input: `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `m`, which is also a positive integer constrained by the permutations of length `n`. The function calculates the `m`-th permutation of a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. It does so by iteratively determining which number to place in each position of the permutation based on factorial calculations. The function prints each element of the permutation during the process.

However, the function does not return any value; it only outputs the permutation elements directly to the console. Additionally, it does not handle cases where `m` exceeds the number of possible permutations (`cntn`), which could lead to incorrect behavior. Thus, it assumes valid input without validation. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two implicit parameters `n` and `m`, calculates the `m`-th permutation of the sequence from 1 to `n`, and prints the elements of the permutation. It does not return a value or validate the input against the number of possible permutations. **
