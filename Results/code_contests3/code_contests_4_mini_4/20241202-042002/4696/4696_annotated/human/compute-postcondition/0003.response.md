The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is `int(b)`, which is a positive integer. Since `i` is assigned `int(b)`, after executing the code, `i` will be `int(b) - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings from raw_input split into two parts; `i` is `int(b) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings from raw_input split into two parts; `i` is `int(b) - 1.**
