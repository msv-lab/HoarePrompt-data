The operation `p.remove(p[d])` attempts to remove the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The value of `d` has been calculated as `i // f`, where `f` is the factorial of `(n - k)`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `f` are known, but `p` is not defined in the initial state, leading to uncertainty about the contents of `p`. 

Assuming that `p` is a list with at least `d + 1` elements (since `d` is a valid index), the code will effectively modify `p` by removing the element at index `d`. 

However, without knowing the specific values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and the initial contents of `p`, we can't determine the exact state after the removal operation. The output state will reflect the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is less than `n`; `f` is factorial(n - k); `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`; element at index `d` is removed from list `p`.**
