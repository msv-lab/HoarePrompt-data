You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a permutation p of numbers 1, 2, ..., n. Let's define f(p) as the following sum:

<image>

Find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of f(p).

Input

The single line of input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p).

The problem consists of two subproblems. The subproblems have different constraints on the input. You will get some score for the correct submission of the subproblem. The description of the subproblems follows.

  * In subproblem B1 (3 points), the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 8 will hold. 
  * In subproblem B2 (4 points), the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 will hold. 

Output

Output n number forming the required permutation.

Examples

Input

2 2


Output

2 1 


Input

3 2


Output

1 3 2 

Note

In the first example, both permutations of numbers {1, 2} yield maximum possible f(p) which is equal to 4. Among them, (2, 1) comes second in lexicographical order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p).
def func():
    a, b = raw_input().split()
    n = int(a)
    i = int(b)
    i = i - 1
    p = range(1, n + 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        f = factorial(n - k)
        
        d = i // f
        
        print(p[d]),
        
        p.remove(p[d])
        
        i = i % f
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `p` is an empty list; `i` is the final updated value after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two implicit parameters `n` and `m`, calculates the `m`-th permutation of the sequence from 1 to `n`, and prints the elements of the permutation. It does not return a value or validate the input against the number of possible permutations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
