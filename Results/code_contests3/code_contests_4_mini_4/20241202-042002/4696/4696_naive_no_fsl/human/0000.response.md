Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the lexicographically m-th permutation of the maximum possible value of f(p) as described in the problem. 

The function f(p) is defined by the sum of the products of each element in permutation p and its 1-based index. The maximum value of f(p) occurs when the larger numbers are at the higher indices. However, the program does not account for this constraint when generating permutations.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `m = 1`. The program should return the permutation (1, 2, 3) because it is the lexicographically first permutation with the maximum value of f(p). However, the program starts generating permutations without ensuring they are in the correct order based on the value of f(p).

Additionally, the program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3, and it also contains syntax issues with the way the print function is used, which leads to runtime errors.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs, which confirms that it is incorrect.
