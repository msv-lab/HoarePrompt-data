The code snippet `a, b = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to `a` and the second part to `b`. The variables `a` and `b` are affected by this operation, but the previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown since they depend on user input. The initial state of variables `n` and `m` is not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is the first part of the input, `b` is the second part of the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `a` is the first part of the input, `b` is the second part of the input.**
