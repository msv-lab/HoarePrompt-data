`i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is the second part of the input. The values of the other variables, `n` and `m`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on input `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is the second part of the input, `i` is the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, `b` is the second part of the input, `i` is the integer value of `b.**
