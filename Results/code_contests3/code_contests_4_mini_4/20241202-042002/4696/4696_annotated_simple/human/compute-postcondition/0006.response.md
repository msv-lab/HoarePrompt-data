The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. The value of `k` is 1, so this means `f` is calculated as `factorial(n - 1)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer based on the input `a`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is a positive integer based on input `a`, and `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input `a`; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
