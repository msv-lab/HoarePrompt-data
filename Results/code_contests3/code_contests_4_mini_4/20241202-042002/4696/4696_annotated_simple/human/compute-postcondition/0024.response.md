The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any parameters. It operates within the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n with maximum possible value of f(p). 

Since there are no explicit parameters passed to the function, it likely utilizes some form of global variables or internal logic to determine `n`, `m`, and possibly `cntn`. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined due to the lack of parameters and output information. It seems to be related to permutations and possibly returning some aspect of them based on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and its return value is not specified; it operates under the constraints related to permutations of a positive integer n.**
