The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute again, the value of `n - k` becomes `n - 1`. Thus, `f` will be assigned the value of `factorial(n - 1)`. The states of the other variables `i`, `p`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on input `a`, `f` is `factorial(n - 1)`, `i` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `k` is reset to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input `a`, `f` is `factorial(n - 1)`, `i` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `k` is reset to 1.**
