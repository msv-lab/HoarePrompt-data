The function reads two integers from input, `n` and `i`, where `n` represents the length of permutations of the numbers from 1 to `n`, and `i` is an index that is used to determine a specific permutation. The function then calculates and prints the `i`-th permutation of the numbers [1, 2, ..., n] in lexicographic order. It does not return any value. However, it does not handle invalid input scenarios (e.g., `i` being larger than the total number of permutations).
