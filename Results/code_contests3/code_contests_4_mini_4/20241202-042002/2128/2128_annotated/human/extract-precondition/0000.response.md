Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of barrels, k is an integer representing the number of pourings, and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9) representing the initial amounts of water in each barrel. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
