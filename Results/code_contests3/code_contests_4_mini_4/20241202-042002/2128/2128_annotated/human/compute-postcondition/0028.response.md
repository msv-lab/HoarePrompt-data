According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and since `k` is equal to `n - 1` (which is greater than 1), `k` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1, making `l` equal to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 to satisfy the condition of `l` being less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, and `l` is 3.**
