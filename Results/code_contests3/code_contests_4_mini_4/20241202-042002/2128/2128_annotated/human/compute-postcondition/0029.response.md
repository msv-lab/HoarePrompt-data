`ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`, where `l` is 3. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order and `l` is 3, the value assigned to `ans` will be incremented by the fourth element of the list `arr`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[3]`, and `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[3]`, and `l` is 3.**
