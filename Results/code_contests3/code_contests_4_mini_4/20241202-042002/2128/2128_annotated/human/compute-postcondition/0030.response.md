To deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the given states and the loop code.

1. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, `k` will be at least 0 when `n` is 1 and will be greater than or equal to 1 when `n` is greater than 1. 

2. The loop iterates from `l = 1` to `l = k` (inclusive). This means that if `k` is 0 (which happens when `n = 1`), the loop will not execute at all. 

3. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute `k` times, and during each iteration, it will add `arr[l]` to `ans`.

4. After the loop has executed `k` times, `ans` will be updated to include the sum of `arr[1]` through `arr[k]`. 

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

- If `n` is 1 (thus `k` is 0), the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is the largest integer in `arr`.
- If `n` is greater than 1 (thus `k` is at least 1), `ans` will be the initial largest integer in `arr` plus the sum of all integers from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`.

Therefore, the final output state can be articulated as:

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr` plus the sum of `arr[1]` to `arr[k]` (if `k >= 1`) or remains the largest integer in `arr` (if `k = 0`).**
