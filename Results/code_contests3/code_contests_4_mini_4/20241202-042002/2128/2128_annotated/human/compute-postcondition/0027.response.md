The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Given that `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the `arr` list. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order and has at least 3 elements, the specific value of `arr[2]` will be added to `ans`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]`, and `l` is 2.**
