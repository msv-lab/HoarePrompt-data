Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` (number of barrels), an integer `k` (maximum number of pourings), and a list `a` of integers representing the initial amounts of water in each barrel. It calculates the maximum amount of water that can be obtained by pouring from the `k` fullest barrels into the first barrel, and prints the total amount of water in the first barrel after the pourings for each test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` to `n - 1` to avoid exceeding the number of barrels. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are outside the specified bounds, and assumes valid input as per the constraints.**
