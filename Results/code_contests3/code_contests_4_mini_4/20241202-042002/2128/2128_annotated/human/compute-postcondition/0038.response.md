Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the largest element from `arr`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `k` is set to `n - 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.***
