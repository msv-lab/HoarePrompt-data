According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be increased by 1, making it 2, and it must be that `k` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to the largest element in `arr`, `l` is 2; `ans` is increased by `arr[1]`.**
