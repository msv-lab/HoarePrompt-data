`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to its previous value. The previous value of `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[2]`, and since `l` is 3, `arr[l]` refers to `arr[3]`. The value of `arr[3]` is not explicitly stated but is the fourth element in the sorted array. Therefore, the new value of `ans` becomes `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[3]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to `arr[0] + arr[2] + arr[3]`, `l` is 3**
