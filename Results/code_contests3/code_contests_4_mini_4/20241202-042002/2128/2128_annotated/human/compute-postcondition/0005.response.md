`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in the array. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is equal to the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is equal to the largest element in `arr`.**
