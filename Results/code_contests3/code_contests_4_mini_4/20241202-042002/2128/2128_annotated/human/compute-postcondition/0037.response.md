The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `k` will depend on the value assigned to `n`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the largest element from `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the largest element from `arr`**
