According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `l` remains within the range defined by `1` to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. Since `k` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time as long as `l` becomes 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 (since it needs to accommodate `l` being 3).

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to `arr[0] + arr[2]`, `l` is 3**
