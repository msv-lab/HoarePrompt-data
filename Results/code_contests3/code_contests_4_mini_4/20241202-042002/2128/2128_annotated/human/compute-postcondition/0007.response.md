`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The previous value of `k` is not specified, but since `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, after this assignment, `k` will be less than or equal to `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to the largest element in `arr`, and `k` is now equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to the largest element in `arr`, and `k` is now equal to `n - 1.**
