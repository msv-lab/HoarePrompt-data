According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least `1`. Given that `k` is defined as `n - 1`, if `n` is `1`, then `k` would be `0`, and the loop would not execute. Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than `1`, which makes `k` at least `1`. 

Additionally, the initial value of `i` is `2`, but it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `k` must be at least `1`, which translates to `n` being greater than `1`.
- `l` will start at `1` when the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, and `l` is 1**
