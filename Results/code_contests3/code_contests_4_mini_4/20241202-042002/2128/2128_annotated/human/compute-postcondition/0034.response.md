`arr` is assigned a list of integers created by reading a line from standard input, splitting the line into components, and converting each component to an integer. The values of `n` and `k`, which are also integers, do not affect the creation of `arr`. Since `arr` is dependent on the input, its specific content is unknown, but it will consist of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
