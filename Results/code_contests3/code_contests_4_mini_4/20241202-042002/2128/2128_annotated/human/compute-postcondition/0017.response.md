According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 during the next iteration, making it 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`, so the updated state will need to reflect that `i` is now 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
