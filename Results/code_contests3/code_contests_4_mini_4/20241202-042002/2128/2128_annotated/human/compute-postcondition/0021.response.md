`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. The value of `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, so `arr[0]` is the largest integer in that list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`**
