`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The value of `arr[l]` is accessible since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The specific value of `arr[l]` is not provided, but it is known that `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`. Therefore, after executing the code, the state of `ans` will be updated to include the value of `arr[l]`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]`.**
