The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer, `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` holds. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr**
