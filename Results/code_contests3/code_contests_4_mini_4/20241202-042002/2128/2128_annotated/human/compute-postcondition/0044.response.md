The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The variable `l` is 3, so `arr[l]` refers to `arr[3]`. The value of `arr[3]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a valid integer. The previous value of `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, but we do not know the specific values of `arr[2]` or `arr[3]`. Therefore, we do not have specific values to report, but we acknowledge that `ans` has been modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[3]**
