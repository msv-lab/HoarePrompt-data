The `arr` variable is assigned the value of a sorted version of itself in reverse order. The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, but the specific contents of `arr` are not known. Therefore, after execution, `arr` will be sorted in descending order. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n`, as well as `k`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**.
