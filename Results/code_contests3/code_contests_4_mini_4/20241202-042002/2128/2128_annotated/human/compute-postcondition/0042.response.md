The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `ans` is updated by adding `arr[2]` to its current value. Other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 2, `ans` has been increased by the value of `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 2, `ans` has been increased by the value of `arr[2]**
