`arr` is assigned the sorted version of itself in descending order (due to `reverse=True`). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new arrangement of `arr` after sorting. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values, `arr` is sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are the input values, `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
