According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`, which is the loop variable in the range from 1 to `k + 1`. Since `l` is currently 2 and it is incremented by 1 for each iteration, the next value of `l` will be 3. The loop will execute again as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and since `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3 (as `l` will be 3 in the next iteration). 

So, the updated states would be:
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3, `ans` has been increased by the value of `arr[2]**
