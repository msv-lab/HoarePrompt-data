The code assigns values to `n` and `k` by reading a line of input and splitting it into two parts, which are then converted to integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as does `i`, since they are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the new variables `n` and `k`, while maintaining the previous values of `t` and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
