According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute again as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and since `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `l` becoming 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. 

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `l` is now 2. 

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is at least 1, `l` is 2; `ans` has been increased by the value of `arr[1]` for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2.**
