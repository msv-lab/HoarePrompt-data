According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 2**
