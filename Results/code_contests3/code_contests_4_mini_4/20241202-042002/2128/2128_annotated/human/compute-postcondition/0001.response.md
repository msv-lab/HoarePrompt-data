According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and it is read from the input. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and the loop index `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
