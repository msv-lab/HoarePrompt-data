The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and has at least 2 elements, `arr[2]` is a valid index. The previous value of `ans` is equal to the largest element in `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be `arr[0] + arr[2]`. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is equal to `arr[0] + arr[2]`, `l` is 2**
