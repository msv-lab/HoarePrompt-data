In the given code snippet, `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The variable `l` is 2, so `arr[l]` refers to `arr[2]`. Since `ans` has already been increased by `arr[2]` previously, it will now be increased again by the same value. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

The previous state indicated that `ans` was already increased by `arr[2]`, but we do not have the specific value of `arr[2]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` has been increased by `arr[2]` once more.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]` again, `l` is 2**
