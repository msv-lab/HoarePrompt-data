`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `arr[0]` is the largest element in the array. The values of the other variables (`t` and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.**
