The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on a predefined set of inputs that represent multiple test cases. Each test case consists of:

- `t`: a positive integer indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer representing the number of barrels (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5).
  - `k`: an integer representing the number of pourings allowed.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers representing the initial amount of water in each barrel (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

After processing the input, the function returns results based on the logic applied to the test cases. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases based on the number of barrels, pourings allowed, and the initial amounts of water in each barrel, returning results specific to each test case.**
