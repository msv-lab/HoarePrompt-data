According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 after the current iteration, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
