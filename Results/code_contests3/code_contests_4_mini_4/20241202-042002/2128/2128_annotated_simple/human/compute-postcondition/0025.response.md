The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `ans` is the largest element of `arr`, after the execution of the code, `ans` will be the largest element of `arr` plus `arr[l]`. The states of the other variables `t`, `i`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the largest element of `arr` plus `arr[l]`, and `k` is at least 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the largest element of `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 1**
