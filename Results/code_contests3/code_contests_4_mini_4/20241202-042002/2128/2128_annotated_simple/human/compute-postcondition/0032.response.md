According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 2**
