The variable `arr` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the results of `sys.stdin.readline().split()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into individual string components that are then converted to integers. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from this input, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided or known. The previous values of `t` and `i` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `t` and `i`, along with the new list `arr` that holds the integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1; `arr` is a list of integers from input**
