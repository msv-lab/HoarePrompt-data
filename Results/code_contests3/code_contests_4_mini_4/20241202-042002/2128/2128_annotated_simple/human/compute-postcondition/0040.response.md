The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. Since `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, it will increase by the value of `arr[l]`. The variables `t` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the largest element in `arr` plus `arr[l]`, and `arr[l]` is added to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the largest element in `arr` plus `arr[l]`**
