The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order. The previous value of `arr` is unknown, but it is a list of integers derived from the input, and the sorting operation will rearrange its elements from highest to lowest. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order.**
