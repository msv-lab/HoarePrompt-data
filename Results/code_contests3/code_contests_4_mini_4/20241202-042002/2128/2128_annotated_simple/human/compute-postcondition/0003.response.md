The code assigns `arr` to a list of integers, which are the values received from the input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code, but `arr` is now defined as a list of integers based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned input integer values; `arr` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned input integer values; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
