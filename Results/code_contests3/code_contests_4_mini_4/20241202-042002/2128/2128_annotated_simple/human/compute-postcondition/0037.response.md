The variable `k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. However, the value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine a specific value for `k`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, and `k` is `n - 1`, where `n` is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the largest element in `arr`, `k` is `n - 1`, where `n` is unknown**
