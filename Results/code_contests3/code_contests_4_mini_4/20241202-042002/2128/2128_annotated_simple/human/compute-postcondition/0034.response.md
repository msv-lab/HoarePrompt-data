The code initializes `arr` as a list of integers, where the integers are obtained by reading a line from standard input, splitting it into parts, and mapping each part to an integer. The variables `n` and `k` are previously assigned values from this input, but the values of `n` and `k` are not directly impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `arr` based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `arr` is a list of integers from the input**
