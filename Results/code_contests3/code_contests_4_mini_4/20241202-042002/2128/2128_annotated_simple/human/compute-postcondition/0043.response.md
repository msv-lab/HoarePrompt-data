According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1, making it 4. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to the largest element in `arr` plus `arr[2] plus arr[3]`, `l` is 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 4**
