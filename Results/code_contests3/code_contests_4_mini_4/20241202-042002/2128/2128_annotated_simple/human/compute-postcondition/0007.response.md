`k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Given that `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, this means that the new value of `k` will be less than or equal to `n - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`, and `k` is now equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`, `k` is now equal to `n - 1**
