According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for `l` values in the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `l` would have been equal to the current value of the loop variable. Since `i` is 0 and `k` is at least 1, the loop has executed once, and `l` must now be increased by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 (the first value in the range), and `k` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 2, and `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 2, `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[2]`, `l` is 2**
