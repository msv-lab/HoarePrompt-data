According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the upper limit set by `k`. The loop will execute for values of `l` starting from 1 up to and including `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value for `l` will be 3. Additionally, since `k` is at least 2, `l` must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 3, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]` again, `l` is 3**
