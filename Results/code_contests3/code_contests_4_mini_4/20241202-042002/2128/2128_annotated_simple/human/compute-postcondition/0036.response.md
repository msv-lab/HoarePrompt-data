`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in `arr`. The values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the largest element in `arr`.**
