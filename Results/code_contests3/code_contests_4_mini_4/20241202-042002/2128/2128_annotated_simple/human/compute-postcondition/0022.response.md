The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `n`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment of `k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`, `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`**
