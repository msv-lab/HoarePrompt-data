The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` must be 3 for the loop to execute a third time, we can assume that `arr` has at least 4 elements (indexed from 0 to at least 3). The existing value of `ans` is the largest element in `arr` plus `arr[2]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` will be updated to include the value of `arr[3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to the largest element in `arr` plus `arr[2] plus arr[3]`, `l` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 3.**
