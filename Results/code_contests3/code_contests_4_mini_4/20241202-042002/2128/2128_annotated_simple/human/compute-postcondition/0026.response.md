According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented.

Since `l` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `l` will be incremented to 2. Additionally, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again, as it needs to accommodate the new value of `l`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is the largest element of `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2**
