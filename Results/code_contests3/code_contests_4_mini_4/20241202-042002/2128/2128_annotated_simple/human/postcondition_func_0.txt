The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case specifies the number of barrels and the number of pourings allowed. It reads the initial amounts of water in each barrel, sorts them in descending order, and calculates the total amount of water by adding the largest amount and the amounts of the next `k` largest barrels (or up to `n-1` barrels if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`). The function prints the total amount of water for each test case. It does not return any values; it only prints the results.
