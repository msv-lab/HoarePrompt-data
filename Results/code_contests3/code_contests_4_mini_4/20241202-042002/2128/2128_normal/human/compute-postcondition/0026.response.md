According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute for values of `l` starting from 1 up to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again if `l` is incremented.

Since `l` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` will become 2. For the loop to continue executing, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1]`, `l` is 2**
