The variable `ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in `arr`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, and `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]**
