The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is 3, this means `arr[3]` is added to the previous value of `ans`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[3]`, and `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[3]`, `l` is 3**
