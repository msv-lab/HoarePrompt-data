The list `arr` is assigned the sorted values of itself in reverse order. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The specific values of `arr` are modified to be in descending order, but since we don't have the actual values of `arr`, we cannot specify the exact contents after sorting. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, and `arr` is sorted in reverse order.**
