`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of the sorted array `arr`, which is the maximum value in the array since `arr` is sorted in descending order. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the maximum value from `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value from `arr`**
