According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. 

Since it is given that `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, if `n` is a positive integer, then `k` must also be at least 1 (if `n` is also at least 1). Additionally, the loop variable `l` will start at 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need the following states:
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- The starting value of `l` is 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`, and for the loop to execute the first time `l` is 1.**
