`ans` is assigned the value `ans + arr[l]`. The previous value of `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`, and `l` is 3. Therefore, `ans` now includes the value of `arr[3]`, which is the fourth element of the sorted array. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Hence, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3]`, `l` is 3**
