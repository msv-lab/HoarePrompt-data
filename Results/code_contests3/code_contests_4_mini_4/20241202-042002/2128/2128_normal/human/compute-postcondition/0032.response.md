According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `t`. Since `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute at least once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`, which is currently greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 2**
