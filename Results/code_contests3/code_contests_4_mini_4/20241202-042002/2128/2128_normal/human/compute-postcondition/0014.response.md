The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 3, `arr[l]` refers to the fourth element of the sorted array `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is the maximum value from `arr` plus `arr[2]`. The other variables, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the previous maximum value from `arr` plus `arr[2]` plus `arr[3]`, `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the previous maximum value from `arr` plus `arr[2]` plus `arr[3]`, `l` is 3**.
