The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the sorted array `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is the maximum value from `arr`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` will be the maximum value from `arr` plus the third element of `arr`. The states of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value from `arr` plus `arr[2]`, and `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value from `arr` plus `arr[2]`, and `l` is 2.**
