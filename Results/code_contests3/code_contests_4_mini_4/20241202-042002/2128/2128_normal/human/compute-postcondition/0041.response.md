According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `l` ranging from 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `k`, for the loop to execute again, `l` must be increased to 2. Additionally, the loop can only execute again if `k` is at least 2, because the loop condition requires `l` to be less than or equal to `k`.

In this case, since `k` is at least 1, and we want it to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2. Therefore, the state must reflect that `l` is now 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[1]`, and `l` is 2.**
