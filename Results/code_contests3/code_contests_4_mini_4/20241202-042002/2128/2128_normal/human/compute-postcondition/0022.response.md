The variable `k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. Since `n` is a value obtained from input, the specific value of `k` will depend on the value of `n`. The other variables `t`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]**
