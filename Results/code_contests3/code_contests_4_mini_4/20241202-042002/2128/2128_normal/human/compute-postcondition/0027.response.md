The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the sorted array `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1]`. After adding `arr[2]` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`, `l` is 2**
