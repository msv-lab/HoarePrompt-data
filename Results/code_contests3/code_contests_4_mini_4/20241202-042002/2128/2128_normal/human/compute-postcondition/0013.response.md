According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the maximum value from `arr` plus `arr[2]`, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3**
