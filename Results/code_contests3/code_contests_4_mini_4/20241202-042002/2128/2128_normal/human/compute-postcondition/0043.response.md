According to the code, the loop executes for values of `l` starting from 1 up to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 because the loop runs while `l` is less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[2]`, and `l` is 3**
