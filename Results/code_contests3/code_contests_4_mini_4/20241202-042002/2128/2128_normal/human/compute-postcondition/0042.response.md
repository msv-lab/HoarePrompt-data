`ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[l]`. The value of `l` is 2, so `arr[l]` refers to `arr[2]`. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it is being incremented by the value of `arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[2]`, and `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to be its previous value plus `arr[2]`, and `l` is 2.**
