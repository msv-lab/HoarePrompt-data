`ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 1, `arr[l]` refers to the second element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `arr[0]` is the largest element and `arr[1]` is the second largest element. The value of `ans` was previously assigned to `arr[0]`. Therefore, after execution, `ans` becomes `arr[0] + arr[1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1]`, `l` is 1**
