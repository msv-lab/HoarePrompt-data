According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `l` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1.

Thus, for the next iteration, `l` will be 3. Since `k` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3 (to allow `l` to be equal to 3).

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is sorted in reverse order, `ans` is `arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]`, `l` is 3**
