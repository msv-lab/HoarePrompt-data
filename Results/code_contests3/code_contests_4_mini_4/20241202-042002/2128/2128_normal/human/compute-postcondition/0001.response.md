According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1, as the range is from 0 to `t` (exclusive). The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Since `n`, `k`, and `a` are unchanged and do not affect the loop execution, we only need to consider the state of `t`.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
