The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The previous value of `n` is obtained from input, so `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` has. Other variables `t`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`.**
