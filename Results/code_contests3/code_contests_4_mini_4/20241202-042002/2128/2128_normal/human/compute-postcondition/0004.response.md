The `arr` list is assigned the value of `sorted(arr, reverse=True)`, which sorts the elements of `arr` in descending order. The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but they are a list of integers created from the input values. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorting of `arr` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
