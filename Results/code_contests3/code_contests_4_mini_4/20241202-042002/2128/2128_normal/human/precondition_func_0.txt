t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of barrels and k is an integer representing the number of pourings; a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{9}) representing the initial amount of water in each barrel, where the total number of barrels across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
