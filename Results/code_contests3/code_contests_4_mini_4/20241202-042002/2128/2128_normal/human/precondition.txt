t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of barrels, k is a positive integer representing the number of pourings allowed, and a is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial amounts of water in each barrel.
