The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100, and the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal. The function compares the two strings and returns a value based on this comparison. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two strings `S` and `T` of equal length and return a result based on their comparison. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, S and T, both strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters, and returns a result based on the comparison of these strings.**
