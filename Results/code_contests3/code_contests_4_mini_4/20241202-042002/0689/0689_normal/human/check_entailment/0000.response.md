To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's first analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description
We need to determine if string `S` equals string `T` after performing a rotation. A rotation means moving the last character of the string to the front. 

### Program
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Output Hints
The function checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t` any number of times. It prints 'Yes' if `s` can be formed by rotating `t`, otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Initial Assessment
1. The program reads two strings, `s` and `t`.
2. It checks every possible rotation of `t` to see if it equals `s`.
3. It generates a rotation by slicing `t` at index `i` and checking if `t[i:] + t[:i]` equals `s`.
4. If any rotation matches `s`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Edge Case Consideration
- The program should handle cases where `s` and `t` are identical, which should return 'Yes'.
- It should also handle cases where `s` and `t` are completely different and of the same length, which should return 'No'.
- It needs to correctly handle the minimum input size (2 characters).

### Check Against Output Hints
The output hints state that the function accepts two strings of equal length and checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. This agrees with the implementation.

### Potential Issues
- The program uses `raw_input()` which may not be compatible in Python 3 as it should be `input()`. This does not directly affect output correctness for the logic itself but impacts execution in different Python environments.
- The logic correctly checks for all possible rotations of `t`, so it should cover all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion
The code meets the requirements of the problem description, and I cannot find any examples where it fails to perform correctly. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly checks for string rotations and addresses the problem as required.
