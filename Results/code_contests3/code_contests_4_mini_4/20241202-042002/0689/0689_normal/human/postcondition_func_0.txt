The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` of equal length, which consist of lowercase English letters. It checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t` any number of times. If `s` can be formed by rotating `t`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
