The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` of equal length (between 2 and 100 characters) and checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`. It returns 'Yes' if `s` can be formed by rotating `t`, or 'No' if it cannot. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input strings do not meet the specified length constraints.
