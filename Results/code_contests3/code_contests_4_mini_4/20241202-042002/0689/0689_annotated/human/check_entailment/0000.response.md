Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a few issues that prevent it from accurately fulfilling the requirements outlined in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is a function from Python 2.x. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. If this code were executed in Python 3, it would raise a `NameError`.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the rotation check, but the problem description specifies that the output should be "Yes" or "No" (case-sensitive). The program prints the answer using a list indexing method that does not match the required output format.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func()` does not take any parameters but instead reads directly from standard input. This is not an issue per se, but a more structured approach would involve passing the strings as parameters, making it easier to test and reuse the function.

4. **Logic**: The logic for checking if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` is correct. It checks all possible rotations of `t` to see if any match `s`. However, since the output formatting and input handling are incorrect, the function's correctness is compromised.

In summary, even though the core logic for checking string rotation is implemented correctly, the issues with input handling and output formatting lead to the conclusion that the program does not meet the problem description correctly. Therefore, the output should be "False".
