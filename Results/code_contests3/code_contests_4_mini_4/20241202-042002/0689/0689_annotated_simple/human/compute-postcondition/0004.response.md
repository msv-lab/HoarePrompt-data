Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` (i.e., moving characters from the beginning of `t` to the end). It prints 'Yes' if `s` can be formed from `t` by rotation, and 'No' otherwise. **
