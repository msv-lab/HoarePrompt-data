The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and their lengths are between 2 and 100, with the constraint that the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot define specific return values based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two strings `S` and `T` of equal length, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, S and T, which are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters.**
