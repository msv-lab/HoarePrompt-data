To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly checks if one string is a rotation of another.

### Analysis of the Problem Description
The problem requires us to determine if string `S` can become string `T` after performing a rotation operation any number of times. The rotation operation shifts the last character of `S` to the front, effectively rotating the string.

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The provided program reads two strings, `s` and `t`, and checks if `s` can be formed by rotating `t`. The line of interest is:
```python
print['No', 'Yes'][any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))]
```

Here's how this works:
1. `t[i:] + t[:i]` generates all possible rotations of `t` by slicing it at index `i` and concatenating the two parts.
2. `any(...)` checks if any of these rotations are equal to `s`.
3. The result is printed as 'Yes' if there's a match, otherwise 'No'.

### Correctness Verification
1. The program meets the requirement that both strings consist of lowercase English letters and that their lengths are equal.
2. It successfully generates all possible rotations of `t` and checks if any of these equal `s`.
3. The output format is correct as it prints 'Yes' if `S` can be obtained from `T` through rotations, and 'No' otherwise.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases as it generates and checks all rotations of `T`. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
