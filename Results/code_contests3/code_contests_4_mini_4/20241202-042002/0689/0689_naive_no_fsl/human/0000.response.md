Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it uses `raw_input()` which is not appropriate for Python 3, where `input()` should be used instead. This would lead to a runtime error if the code is executed in a Python 3 environment.

Moreover, the code checks if any rotation of string `T` matches string `S` using the expression `any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))`. While this logic is correct for determining if `S` equals `T` after rotation, the output format does not match the requirement. The problem description specifies to print "Yes" or "No", but the program uses a list indexing method that can lead to confusion and does not explicitly print "Yes" or "No" as stated.

For example, if we input:
```
abc
bca
```
The expected output should be "Yes" (since `abc` can be rotated to `bca`), but the program will output "No" if it doesn't recognize `bca` as a valid rotation of `abc` due to the input/output handling.

Additionally, if we consider the case where `S` and `T` are the same but not in a rotated form, like:
```
abc
abc
```
The expected output should definitely be "Yes", but again, due to the mismanagement of input and output, it would not function correctly.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for correctness in every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
