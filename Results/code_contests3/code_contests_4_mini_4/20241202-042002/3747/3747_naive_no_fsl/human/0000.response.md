Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it has a hardcoded condition that checks if `n == 11`, which leads to a specific case being handled incorrectly without proper logic for general cases. For example, if the input is:

```
11
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output should be `1` since all coins are the same and can go into one pocket. However, due to the hardcoded condition, the program will output `5`, which is incorrect.

Moreover, the logic for counting the occurrences of coin values and finding the maximum count is correct; however, the hardcoded condition disrupts the overall correctness of the program. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
