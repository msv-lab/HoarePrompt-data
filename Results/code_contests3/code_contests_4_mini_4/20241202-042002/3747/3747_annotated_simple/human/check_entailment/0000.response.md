The provided annotated program attempts to solve the problem of distributing coins into pockets, such that no two coins of the same value are placed in the same pocket. 

Let's analyze the program step-by-step against the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input values. The first line reads the number of coins `n`, and the second line reads the values of the coins into a list `a`. This part correctly follows the input format described in the problem.

2. **Special Case Handling**: There is a condition that checks if `n` is equal to 11, and if so, it prints 5. This is a hard-coded response that does not align with the logic required by the problem statement. The problem does not specify any special handling for specific values of `n`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program initializes a list `c` of size 101 to count occurrences of each coin value (since coin values are between 1 and 100). This part is correct as it allows the program to determine how many times each coin value appears.

4. **Determining Minimum Pockets**: The program prints `max(c)`, which represents the maximum count of any coin value. This is the correct approach to determine the minimum number of pockets needed because the maximum occurrence of a coin value dictates how many pockets are necessary to accommodate that many identical coins.

However, due to the special case handling for `n == 11`, the program does not correctly handle all input scenarios. Specifically, it would output 5 when `n` is 11 regardless of the actual values in `a`, which could lead to incorrect results. 

### Conclusion
Because the program does not correctly implement the logic for all input cases (due to the special case for `n == 11`), it fails to meet the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
