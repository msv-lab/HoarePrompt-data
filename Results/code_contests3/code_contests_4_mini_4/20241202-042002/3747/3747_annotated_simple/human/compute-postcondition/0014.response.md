The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, it operates with the constraints that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). 

The function's output based on these constraints is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot describe any specific return values or cases.

Functionality: **The function does not take parameters directly but operates with a constraint that n is an integer between 1 and 100, and a is a list of n integers each between 1 and 100. The specific output or return value is not defined.**
