The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the second element of the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within 1 to 100, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements which means `a[1]` (the second element) is valid, and `c` is a list of 101 integers where the index `d` is guaranteed to be within the range of `c` due to the constraints on `a`. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the state of `c` will change at index `d` by increasing it by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and other indices of `c` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `c[d]` is incremented by 1.**
