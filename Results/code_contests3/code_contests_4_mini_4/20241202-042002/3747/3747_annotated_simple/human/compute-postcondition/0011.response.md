`c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the third element in the list `a`. The value of `d` is determined by the third element of `a`, and since `a` has at least 3 elements, `d` will be a valid index for the list `c`. The value of `c` at index `d` is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `c[d]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements; `c[d]` is incremented by 1.**
