`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping each element of the input (split into separate strings) to an integer. The specific values of the elements in `a` will depend on the input provided via `raw_input()`. The variable `n` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
