The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, but the specific value of `n` is not provided. The list `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the specific value of `n` is now determined by input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the specific value of `n` is now determined by input**.
