The loop iterates over each element `d` in the list `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the list `c`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `c` will contain the counts of each integer that appears in the list `a`, where the index represents the integer value from 0 to 100. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, still bounded between 1 and 100, and `a` will still be the original list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers where each `c[i]` represents the count of integer `i` in the list `a`.**
