The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. Since the values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this line, the output state will reflect the initialization of `c`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `c` is a list of 101 zeros**
