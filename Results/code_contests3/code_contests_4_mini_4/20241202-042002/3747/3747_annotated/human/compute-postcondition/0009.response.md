The value at index `d` of `c` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the second element of the list `a`, which is guaranteed to be within the bounds of the list. The list `c` is affected as its `d`th index value increases by 1. The other variables `n`, `a`, and the remaining elements of `c` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 1 integer; `d` is the second element of `a`; the value at index `d` of `c` has been incremented by 1.**
