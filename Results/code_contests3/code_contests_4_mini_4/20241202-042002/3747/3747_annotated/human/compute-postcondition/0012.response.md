The loop iterates over each integer in the list `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the list `c` for each element found in `a`. After the loop has executed for all elements in `a`, the list `c` will contain the counts of each integer from 1 to 100 based on the occurrences in `a`. 

Since the initial state guarantees that `n` is at least 1 and at most 100, and that each `a[i]` falls within the range of 1 to 100, the output after all iterations will reflect the total occurrences of each integer. 

Output State: **`c` is a list of counts where `c[i]` is the number of times integer `i` appears in list `a` for `i` from 1 to 100, `n` is the number of elements in `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers.**
