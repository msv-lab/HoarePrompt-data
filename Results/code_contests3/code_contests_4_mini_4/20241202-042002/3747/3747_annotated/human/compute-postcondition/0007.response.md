The value of `d` is the first element of the list `a`. The statement `c[d] += 1` increments the value at index `d` of the list or array `c` by 1. The previous state of `c` is not provided, but we know it must be initialized properly to accommodate the index `d`. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 1 integer, `d` is the first element of `a`, and the value at index `d` of `c` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 1 integer, `d` is the first element of `a`, and the value at index `d` of `c` is incremented by 1.**
