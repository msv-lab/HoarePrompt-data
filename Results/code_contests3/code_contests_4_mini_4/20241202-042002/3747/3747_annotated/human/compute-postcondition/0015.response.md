Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It checks if `n` is equal to 11 and prints 5 if true. It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a` and prints the maximum count found. If `n` is not 11, it does not print anything in that case. **
