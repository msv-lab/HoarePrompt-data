According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will execute for each element in `a`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, it ensures that the list `a` has at least one integer. The variable `d` will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least 1 integer, and on the first iteration, `d` will be the first element of `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 1 integer, `d` is the first element of `a`**
