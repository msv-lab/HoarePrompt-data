The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100**
