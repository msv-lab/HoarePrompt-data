Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Special Case for n = 11**: The program includes a specific check for when `n` equals 11. If this condition is met, it outputs 5 without performing any calculations based on the values of the coins, which does not align with the task of finding the minimum number of pockets required to distribute the coins.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each coin value in the list `a`, but it does not use this information correctly to determine the minimum number of pockets required. Simply printing the maximum count of occurrences (`max(c)`) does not account for the fact that Polycarp can distribute coins into multiple pockets. The program fails to calculate the actual required number of pockets, as per the problem statement.

3. **General Case Handling**: If `n` is not equal to 11, the program does not provide any output, which is inconsistent with the requirement to always provide a number representing the minimum number of pockets needed.

To summarize, the program does not correctly handle all cases and does not fulfill the requirement of finding the minimum number of pockets for distributing the coins according to the specified rules. Thus, it does not meet the problem description.
