Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
According to the problem, all coins have the same value (1), so Polycarp can only put one coin of value 1 in one pocket. Thus, he would need 5 pockets for this input.

However, the program would count the occurrences of the coin values and print `max(c)`, which would return `5` in this case, indicating that Polycarp needs `5` pockets. This is incorrect because the expected output should be `1` since he can only put one of each value in a pocket.

Another issue is that the program has a hard-coded condition for when `n` is `11`, which is not mentioned in the problem description and could lead to incorrect outputs for that specific case.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
