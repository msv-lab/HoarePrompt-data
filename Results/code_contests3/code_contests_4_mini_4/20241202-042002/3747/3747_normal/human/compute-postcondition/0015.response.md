Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). If `n` is equal to 11, it prints the number 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a`, storing these counts in a list `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum count found in `c`, which represents the highest frequency of any integer from the list `a`. If `n` is 0 or the input is invalid, the function does not handle these cases and will not print any output.**
