The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the first element of the list `a`. This means that the count at the index `d` in the list `c` will increase by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `c` are all affected by this operation, specifically the count at the index `d` in the list `c`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 1 integer, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, `d` is the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`)**
