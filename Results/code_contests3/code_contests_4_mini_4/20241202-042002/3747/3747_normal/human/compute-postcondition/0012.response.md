The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` and increments the corresponding index in the list `c`. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the list `c` will contain the counts of each integer from 1 to 100 as represented by the elements of `a`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, and `a` will remain the same as it was initially.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers where `c[i]` indicates the count of the integer `i` in `a` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 100.**
