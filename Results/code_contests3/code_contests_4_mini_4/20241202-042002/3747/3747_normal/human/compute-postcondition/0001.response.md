The variable `a` is assigned a list of integers obtained from the input, where the input consists of `n` integers separated by spaces. The previous value of `n` determines how many integers will be read into the list `a`. The initial state does not change because the input process does not directly modify `n`. Therefore, after execution, `a` will contain `n` integers that are inputted by the user. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100**
