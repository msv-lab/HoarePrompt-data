`c` is assigned a list of 101 integers, all initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.**
