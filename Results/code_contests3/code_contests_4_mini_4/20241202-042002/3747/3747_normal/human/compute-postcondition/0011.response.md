The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the third element of the list `a`. Given that `a` contains at least 3 integers, the previous value of `c[d]` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `c` are not changed, but `c[d]` is affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c[d]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, where `d` is the third element of `a`.**
