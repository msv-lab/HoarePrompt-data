The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the second element of `a` (i.e., `a[1]`). The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 2 integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, and `d` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 2 integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, `d` is the second element of `a`.**
