To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the minimum square size that can embed a 2n-gon for given odd integers n. The formula used to compute the side length of the square is derived from geometry involving regular polygons.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))

for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))
```

#### Key Observations:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases T and then reads each odd integer n. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Mathematical Function**: The function `func_1(n)` computes a value using trigonometric functions. 
   - It uses `math.cos` and `math.sin` to compute the ratio required for determining the square side length.
   - The arguments passed to these functions are based on the properties of the polygon.
3. **Output Formatting**: The output is formatted to 9 decimal places, ensuring precision which meets the requirement of an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\).

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program assumes that the input n is always an odd integer within the specified bounds (3 ≤ n ≤ 199). It does not handle cases where n is even or outside the specified range, but the problem guarantees that n will always be odd and within bounds.
- It also assumes that the input will be valid as per the problem statement, hence no error handling for invalid inputs.

### Testing for Correctness:
- For n = 3, it should compute the side length of the square that can embed a hexagon (2n-gon).
- For n = 5, it should compute the side length for a decagon (2n-gon).
- For n = 199, it computes for a 398-gon.

Given that the mathematical formula used in `func_1(n)` accurately reflects the geometrical requirements for embedding the polygon, and the program handles the input and output as described, there seems to be no apparent case where the program fails.

### Conclusion:
After careful consideration of the problem and the program, I find that the program adheres to the requirements and correctly computes the desired outputs for the test cases presented.

Correctness: **True**.
