Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 199) and returns the value of the expression cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n)). There are no checks for the validity of `n` within the function; therefore, if `n` is outside the specified range or is not an odd integer, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.**
