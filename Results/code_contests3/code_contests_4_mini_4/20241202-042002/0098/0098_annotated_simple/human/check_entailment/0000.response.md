The provided annotated program calculates the value of the expression `cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n))`. To determine if this is correct according to the problem description, we need to analyze what the problem is asking for and what the program is outputting.

### Problem Analysis:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon with `2n` vertices (a `2n-gon`).
2. The input is an integer `n`, which is always odd, and we need to output the minimum square side length for each test case.
3. The output must be a real number with a precision that meets an absolute or relative error of `10^{-6}`.

### Program Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n)` calculates a specific mathematical expression involving trigonometric functions, where `n` is a positive odd integer.
- The expression `cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n))` is derived from the geometry of the regular `2n-gon` and relates to how to fit it within a square.

### Mathematical Derivation:
To find the side length `s` of the square that can contain the `2n-gon`, we can derive it as follows:

1. The height of the `2n-gon` when inscribed in a square relates to the maximum distance from the center to a vertex.
2. The distance from the center to a vertex of a regular `2n-gon` is given by the formula involving the circumradius `R`:
   \[
   R = \frac{1}{2 \sin(\pi/(2n))}
   \]
3. The side length of the square that can encompass this polygon is derived from this circumradius.

Upon simplifying and rearranging, we find that the side length of the square can be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions involving `n`. The program's calculation of `cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n))` does indeed correspond to the calculation needed to derive the square's side length for a `2n-gon`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly computes the necessary value for embedding the `2n-gon` in a square, it follows the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
