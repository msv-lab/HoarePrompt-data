#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199, and T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 200 representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of the expression math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199 and returns the value of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs, so if `n` is not within the specified range, the function will still attempt to compute the expression, potentially leading to undefined behavior for values outside this range.
