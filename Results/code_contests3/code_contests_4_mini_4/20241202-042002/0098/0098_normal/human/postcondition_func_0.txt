The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199 and returns the value of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs, so if `n` is not within the specified range, the function will still attempt to compute the expression, potentially leading to undefined behavior for values outside this range.
