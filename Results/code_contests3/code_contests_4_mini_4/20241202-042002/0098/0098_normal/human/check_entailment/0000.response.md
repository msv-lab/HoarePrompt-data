To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description
The problem requires finding the square of the minimum size such that a 2n-gon can be embedded in a square. The input is a series of odd integers (n) and the output should be the minimum side length of the square.

### Program Analysis
The program consists of a function `func_1(n)` that computes the expression:

```python
return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```

This function is called for each test case to compute the required side length of the square.

### Output Hints
The output hints indicate that the function accepts a positive odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199 and computes the value of the expression without any additional checks for invalid inputs.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. **Input Range**: The function does not perform checks for input values outside the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 199). If an invalid `n` is provided, the function would still attempt to compute the result, which could lead to undefined behavior, especially for values that could cause the sine function to approach zero.

2. **Input Handling**: The program uses `xrange` and `raw_input`, which are specific to Python 2. If someone tries to run this code in Python 3, it will raise an error. This limits the portability of the code.

### Agreement with Output Hints
The output hints correctly state that the function computes based on the formula provided and that invalid inputs could lead to issues. However, they do not mention that the code is not protected against invalid inputs, leading to potential runtime errors or incorrect results if the input is not strictly within the specified range.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it lacks input validation and could potentially produce incorrect results for invalid inputs. This oversight is critical, as the problem specifies that `n` must be an odd integer within a specific range. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may yield correct results for valid inputs, but its failure to handle invalid inputs appropriately means it is not correct overall.
