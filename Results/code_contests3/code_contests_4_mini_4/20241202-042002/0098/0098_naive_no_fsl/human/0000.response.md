To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the input requirements and the program's logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The number of test cases \( T \) followed by \( T \) odd integers \( n \).
2. **Output**: For each \( n \), the program must calculate the side length of the square required to embed a regular polygon with \( 2n \) vertices.

### Program Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n)` computes a value based on the formula:
  \[
  \text{result} = \frac{\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4n}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2n}\right)}
  \]
- It uses the `math` library (however, the `import math` statement is missing, which would cause an error in execution).
- The program iterates over the number of test cases, reads the value of \( n \), and prints the computed result formatted to 9 decimal places.

### Checking the Formula:
The goal is to find the minimum side length of a square that can contain a \( 2n \)-gon. The formula used in the program should yield a correct side length for any odd \( n \).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Invalid Input Handling**: The program does not handle invalid inputs (though the problem guarantees that \( n \) will always be odd and within specified bounds).
2. **Missing Import**: There is no import statement for the `math` module, which will cause a runtime error.
3. **Formula Validity**: We need to verify if the formula correctly computes the required square side length for all odd values of \( n \). The cosine and sine functions used in the formula relate to the geometric properties of the polygon, but without deeper mathematical verification or domain knowledge, we cannot ascertain the correctness of the formula itself.

### Conclusion:
Given the missing `import math`, the program will fail to execute. Additionally, if the formula does not yield the expected results for certain values of \( n \), it would also be considered incorrect.

Thus, based on the above analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect due to the missing import statement for the `math` module, which will cause it to fail at runtime. Moreover, without verification of the correctness of the formula itself across all required cases, we cannot be confident that it meets the problem's requirements.
