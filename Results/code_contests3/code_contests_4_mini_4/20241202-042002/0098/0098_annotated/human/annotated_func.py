#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) divided by math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)) for the positive odd integer n within the range 3 to 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199 and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or even, but it is designed to compute the ratio of these trigonometric functions for the defined input.
