Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199 and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or even, but it is designed to compute the ratio of these trigonometric functions for the defined input. **
