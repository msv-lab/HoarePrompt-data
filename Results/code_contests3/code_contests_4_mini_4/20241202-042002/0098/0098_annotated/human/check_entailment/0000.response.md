Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Output Requirement**: The problem description requires the output to be the minimum side length of a square that can fully contain a 2n-gon. However, the function `func_1(n)` computes a ratio of trigonometric functions, which does not correspond to the required side length of the square.

2. **Mathematical Derivation**: The correct formula to compute the side length of the square needed to embed a 2n-gon involves considerations of the 2n-gon's geometry, specifically its radius and how it fits within a square. The program does not compute this; instead, it uses `math.cos` and `math.sin` in a way that does not yield the correct geometric value.

3. **Function Definition**: The function appears to only handle the case where `n` is a positive odd integer, but it does not explicitly check for constraints laid out in the problem description (though it is stated in the comments). However, even if `n` was valid, the computation remains incorrect.

In summary, the function does not calculate the required side length of the square to embed the 2n-gon as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the output of the function does not satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem.
