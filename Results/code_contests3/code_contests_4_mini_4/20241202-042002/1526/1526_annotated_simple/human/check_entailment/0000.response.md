Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3; it should use `input()` instead. This means that the program will raise an error when executed in a Python 3 environment.

Furthermore, the program counts the occurrences of each character in the string and checks if each count is even. However, the main issue is the input method; if the input cannot be read correctly, the program will not function as intended.

Additionally, the program does not handle edge cases explicitly stated in the problem description. For example, if the input is a single character, the program would erroneously return "Yes" instead of "No" since a single character occurs an odd number of times.

Therefore, the program's incorrect input method and potential error handling lead to a failure to comply with the problem requirements.
