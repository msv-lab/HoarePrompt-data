According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. Since `s` has at least 1 character at the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed at least once. The variable `c` will take on the next character in `s` for the loop to execute again. 

If `c` was not previously in `memo`, then `memo` will contain the key `c` with a value of 1, which indicates that `c` was encountered for the first time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` has at least 1 character, and `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of 1 (if `c` was not previously in `memo`). For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be the next character in `s` (which will be determined by the iteration). 

If we denote the current index of `c` in `s` as `current_index`, then for the loop to execute again, `current_index` must be incremented by 1 to reflect the next character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of 1 if `c` was not previously in `memo`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must have at least `current_index + 1` characters and `c` is the next character in the string `s`.**
