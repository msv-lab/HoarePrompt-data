The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Given that `memo` originally contains the key `c` with a value of `1`, the value for `c` in `memo` is updated to `0`. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, and the structure of `memo` beyond the key `c`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of 0.**
