The code snippet prints 'Yes' if `result` is True and 'No' if `result` is False. Based on the initial state, `result` is either True or False depending on the counts of characters in `s`. The other variables (`w`, `s`, and `memo`) are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output will reflect the value of `result`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary containing keys for each unique character in `s`, and the output is 'Yes' if `result` is True or 'No' if `result` is False.**
