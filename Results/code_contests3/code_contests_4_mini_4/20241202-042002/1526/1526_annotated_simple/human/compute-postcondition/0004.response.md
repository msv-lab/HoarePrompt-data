`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `c` is the first character of `s` and is not in `memo` initially, so after the execution, `c` will now be a key in `memo` with a value of `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s.**
