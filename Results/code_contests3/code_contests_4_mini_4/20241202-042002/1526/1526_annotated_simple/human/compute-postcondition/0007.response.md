According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `s`. Given that `c` is the loop variable representing the current character in `s`, and that `memo` has a key `c` with a value of `1`, we can infer the following: 

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the first character of the string `s`, and `memo[c]` has been updated to `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must move to the next character in the string. Since `s` has at least 1 character, `c` will continue to iterate through each character until it reaches the end of `s`.

Now, since `c` has just been processed (the first character), it will need to be updated to the second character in the next iteration. Therefore, `c` should be the next character in `s`, and `memo` will need to reflect the new value for this character.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 1 character; `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `1`, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be the second character in the string `s`.**
