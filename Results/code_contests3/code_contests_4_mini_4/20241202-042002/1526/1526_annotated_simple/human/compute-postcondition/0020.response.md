The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary containing keys for each unique character in `s`, `x` is an odd integer, and `result` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
