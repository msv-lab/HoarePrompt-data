Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of `0` if `c` was not previously in `memo`. If `c` was already in `memo`, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
