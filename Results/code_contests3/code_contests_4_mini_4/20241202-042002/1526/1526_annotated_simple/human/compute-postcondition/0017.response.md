According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. The loop iterates over the values of `memo`, which represent the counts of occurrences of each unique character in `s`. Since `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, it must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute. 

Given that `s` is a string with at least one character, `memo` should have at least one entry corresponding to the character(s) in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `memo` must be a non-empty dictionary. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `x` will take on the first value from `memo.values()`. Thus, for the loop to execute, we can state that `memo` should be a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, and `x` will be the first value from those pairs.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary containing keys for each unique character in `s`, and for the loop to execute the first time, `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`**
