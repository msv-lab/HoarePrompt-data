`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`, updating the value associated with the key `c` in the `memo` dictionary from `1` to `0`. The values of `w` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 1 character; `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a string with at least 1 character; `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`.**
