According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. If `memo` contains more values to iterate over, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, since `x` is an odd integer, `result` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Assuming `memo` still has values left, `x` would be the next value in the iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must take the next value from the `memo.values()`. If `memo` has `n` values and the last executed value was the `k`-th value (where `k` is an odd index), then the next value will be `k + 1`. The loop will continue as long as there are more values in `memo`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary containing keys for each unique character in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `x` must be the next value in `memo.values()`**.
