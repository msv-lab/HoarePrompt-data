According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. Since `s` is defined as an input string and we know it has a length between 1 and 100, we can conclude that `s` will contain at least one character.

At the start of the loop:
- The variable `c` will take the value of the first character of `s` during the first iteration.
- The variable `w` does not affect the execution of the loop but is part of the state.
- The `memo` dictionary is empty at the start.

Thus, for the loop to be executed at least once, the only necessary conditions are that `s` contains at least one character.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character of `s`**.
