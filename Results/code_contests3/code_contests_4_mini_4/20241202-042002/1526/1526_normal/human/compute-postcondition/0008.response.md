The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. The initial state indicates that `memo` is updated to include the next character in `s`, and this assignment does not affect the string `w` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo[c]` is assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo[c]` is assigned the value 0.**
