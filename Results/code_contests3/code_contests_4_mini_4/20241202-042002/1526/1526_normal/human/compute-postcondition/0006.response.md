The variable `memo` is a dictionary that is being updated. The line `memo[c] += 1` attempts to increment the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. If `c` is not already a key in `memo`, attempting to increment it will raise a `KeyError`, but based on the initial state, it is stated that if `c` is not a key in `memo`, then `memo` is updated to include `c` with a value of 0. Therefore, since `c` is ensured to be present in `memo` at this point, its value will be incremented by 1. 

Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo` is updated to include `c` with a value incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo` is updated to include `c` with a value incremented by 1.**
