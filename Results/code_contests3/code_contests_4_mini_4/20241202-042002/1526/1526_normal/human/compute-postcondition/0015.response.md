To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop, we need to consider the behavior of the loop and the variables involved. The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if `c` is already a key in the dictionary `memo`. If it is not present, it initializes `memo[c]` to 0 and then increments `memo[c]` by 1.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
1. `memo` will contain each unique character from the string `s` as keys, with the corresponding values indicating the count of occurrences of each character.
2. The string `w` remains unchanged throughout the execution, still being a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100.
3. The input string `s` has been fully processed.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo` is a dictionary mapping each character in `s` to its frequency.**
