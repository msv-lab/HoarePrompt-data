Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must have at least `i + 2` characters; `c` is the character at index `i + 1` in `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, then `memo[c]` is assigned the value 0. If `c` is already in `memo`, no changes are made to `memo`.***
