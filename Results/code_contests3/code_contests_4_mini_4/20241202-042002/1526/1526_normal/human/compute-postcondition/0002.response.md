According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will execute for each character in `s`, so `s` must not be empty. Since it is given that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, and `memo` is an empty dictionary, these states do not need to be adjusted. The only condition to check is whether `s` has at least one character to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be a string with at least 1 character, and `c` is the first character in `s`**
