The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo` is a dictionary mapping each character to its frequency with at least one entry; `result` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
