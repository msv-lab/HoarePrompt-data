Output State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least `i + 2` characters; `c` is the character at index `i + 1` in `s`; `memo[c]` is either unchanged (if `c` is already in `memo`) or `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 (if `c` is not in `memo`, it starts from 0 and then becomes 1).**
