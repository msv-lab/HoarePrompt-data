The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100. It counts the frequency of each character in the string and determines if all characters appear an even number of times. If all character frequencies are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value.
