According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` contains more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, the `memo` has been updated to include `c` with a value incremented by 1. This means that `c` is the current character being processed in the loop. To execute one more time, we need to move to the next character in the string `s`. 

Assuming `c` is the current character at some index `i` in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` should be the character at index `i + 1`. The length of `s` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `memo` is updated to include the next character in `s` with a value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must have a length greater than the current index of `c` + 1.**
