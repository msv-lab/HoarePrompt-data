To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description:
The problem states that a string `w` is beautiful if each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs an even number of times in `w`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```
- The program reads a string `s`.
- It uses a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in `s`.
- After populating the dictionary, it checks if each character count is even.
- If all characters have even counts, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a string of lowercase letters and prints 'Yes' if all characters in the string appear an even number of times; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The code correctly counts the occurrences of each character.
2. It checks if each character count is even.
3. It prints the expected output based on the evenness of the counts.

### Edge Cases:
- Single character strings (e.g., "a") should return "No" since 'a' appears once (an odd number).
- Strings with all characters appearing an even number of times (e.g., "aabbcc") should return "Yes".
- Strings with mixed even and odd occurrences (e.g., "abcabc") should return "Yes".

### Validity of Output Hints:
The output hints align with the logic of the code. They accurately describe that it prints "Yes" for strings where all characters appear an even number of times and "No" otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and adheres to the expected output as described in the hints. I cannot find any edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program handles all specified cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately.
