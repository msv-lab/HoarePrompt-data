Correctness: **False**.

The program has a critical issue in how it reads the input. It uses `raw_input()` which is not defined in Python 3 (it is defined in Python 2). This will lead to a `NameError` when executing the code in Python 3. 

Additionally, the logic to determine if the string is beautiful seems correct; however, since the program cannot run successfully due to the input handling error, it fails to meet the requirement of determining if the string is beautiful. 

For example, if the input were "abaccaba", the program should return "Yes" since all characters occur an even number of times. But because of the input handling issue, it would not be able to process this string correctly. 

Thus, the program is not correct for the given problem description.
