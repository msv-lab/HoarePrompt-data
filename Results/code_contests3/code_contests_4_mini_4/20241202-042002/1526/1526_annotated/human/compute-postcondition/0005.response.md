Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is not present in `memo`, then `c` is added to `memo` with a value of 0. There is no else part in the code.***
