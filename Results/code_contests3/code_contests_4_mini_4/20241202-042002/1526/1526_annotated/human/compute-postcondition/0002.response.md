According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. Since `w` is already established as a string with a length between 1 and 100, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The critical factor for the loop execution is the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, then the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `c` will represent the last character in the string `s`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The character `c` will begin as the first character in `s` when the loop starts. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
