The code assigns the value 0 to the key `c` in the `memo` dictionary. Since `memo` contains `c` with a value of 0 or greater, it is clear that the previous value of `memo[c]` is either 0 or some positive integer. After the assignment, `memo[c]` will explicitly be set to 0. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, and `memo` in relation to keys other than `c`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least one character remaining; `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least one character remaining; `memo[c]` is now 0.**
