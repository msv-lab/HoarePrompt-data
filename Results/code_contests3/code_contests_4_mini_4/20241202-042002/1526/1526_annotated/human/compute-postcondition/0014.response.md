The code `memo[c] += 1` increments the value of `memo[c]` by 1. Since it is given that `c` is not in `memo`, `memo[c]` was initially assigned the value 0 before this operation. Therefore, after the execution, `memo[c]` becomes 1. The values of `w`, `s`, and other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` has at least two characters remaining, `c` is the next character in `s`, `memo[c]` is 1**.
