The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one character from `s` and its count, `result` is False, and `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`; `result` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
