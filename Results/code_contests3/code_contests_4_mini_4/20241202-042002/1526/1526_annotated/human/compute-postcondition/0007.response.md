According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1 for the current character `c`, and `w` remains unchanged. Since `c` represents the current character in the string `s`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least one character remaining after the current character. 

Therefore, if `s` has `k` characters and the loop has executed for `k-1` characters, `c` will now represent the `k`-th character in `s`, and `s` must contain at least `k` characters for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least one character remaining, `memo` contains `c` with a value of 0 or greater; for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character remaining.**
