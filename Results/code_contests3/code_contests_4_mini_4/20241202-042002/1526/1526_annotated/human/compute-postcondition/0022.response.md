According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the `memo` dictionary. The state indicates that `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`. For the loop to execute again, there must be additional values in `memo.values()` after the current value of `x`. 

If `x` is an odd integer, the loop would break out, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must not be the last value in `memo.values()`. Therefore, the next value of `x` will be the second value in `memo.values()`, assuming there is at least one more value present.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one character from `s` and its count, `result` is False, and `x` is the second value in `memo.values()` to execute the loop again.**
