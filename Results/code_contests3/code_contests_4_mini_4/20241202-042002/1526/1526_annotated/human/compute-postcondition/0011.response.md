According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least one character remaining, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least one character remaining, and `c` has been assigned the next character from `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `c` will be the next character in `s`, and `s` must have at least one character remaining after the current character is processed.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least two characters remaining; `c` is the next character in `s`**.
