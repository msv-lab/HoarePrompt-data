Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters (with a length between 1 and 100), counts the occurrences of each character, and checks if all characters appear an even number of times. It prints 'Yes' if all counts are even and 'No' if any count is odd. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result. **
