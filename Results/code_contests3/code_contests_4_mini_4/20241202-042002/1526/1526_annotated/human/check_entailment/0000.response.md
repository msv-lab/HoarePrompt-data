Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description due to the following reasons:

1. **Input Method**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3. In Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`. This will cause the program to fail when executed in Python 3, which is the default version currently in use.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` does not accept any parameters. According to the problem description, the input is given as a string `w`. The function should ideally accept this string as an argument to align with standard practices in function design.

3. **Output Specification**: The program prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the result, which is correct; however, it does not return a value from the function. Although the problem states to print 'Yes' or 'No', returning a boolean value could also be a consideration for a more versatile implementation.

4. **Overall Logic**: While the logic for counting characters and checking if their counts are even is correct, the issues mentioned above prevent the program from functioning as intended.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem description due to the use of an incorrect input method for Python 3 and a lack of function parameters, leading to an overall conclusion that it does not fulfill the requirements as specified.
