Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether a string `w` is "beautiful" based on the given problem description. It does the following:

1. Reads input string `w`.
2. Initializes a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character in `w`.
3. Iterates over each character in `w`, updating the count in `memo`.
4. Checks if all counts in `memo` are even.
5. Prints "Yes" if all counts are even, otherwise prints "No".

The program adheres to the constraints, correctly returning "Yes" for strings with all characters occurring an even number of times and "No" otherwise. Given the examples provided in the problem description, the program produces the expected output.

Since there are no edge cases or missing logic that would make the program fail for any valid input within the constraints, the program is correct.
