The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is initially equal to `max(0, arr1[1])` and `j` is 2, we need to check the value of `arr1[2]` to determine the new value of `temp`. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly needed for the output, but we know that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 and the loop condition indicates that `arr1` has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute a second time.

Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `arr1` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `arr1` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to continue.**
