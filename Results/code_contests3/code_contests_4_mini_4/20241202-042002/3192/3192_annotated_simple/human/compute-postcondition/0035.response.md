According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which determines the range. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is the total number of elements in `arr1` (as provided by user input). For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `j`. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from user input, `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
