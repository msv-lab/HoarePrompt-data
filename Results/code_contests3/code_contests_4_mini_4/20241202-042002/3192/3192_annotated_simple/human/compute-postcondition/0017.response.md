According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
