Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the situation:

- The variable `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. 
- The current value of `j` is 3, and `arr1` is a list of integers from user input.

Since `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time, we can assume that `arr1` has at least four elements (indices 0, 1, 2, and 3).

The impact of the code means that `temp` will be updated based on the value of `arr1[3]`. 

The previous value of `temp` is not explicitly mentioned, but it is being compared to `arr1[3]` to determine the new value of `temp`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `temp` is updated to the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from user input, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.**
