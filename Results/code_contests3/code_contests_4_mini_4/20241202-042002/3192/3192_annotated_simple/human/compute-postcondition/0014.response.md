The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. Since `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, this means that `temp` is defined and has a specific value based on the elements in `arr1`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation, but `arr` is updated to include `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`; `j` is `arr1[0]`; `arr` now contains `temp`.**
