The code `arr.append(temp)` adds the value of `temp` to the end of the list `arr`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: 

- `temp` is the maximum value in the sublist `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`.
- `arr` already includes the current elements prior to the execution of this code.

Since `arr` is updated to include the value of `temp`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from user input, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, and `j` is `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from user input, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, and `j` is `arr1[0]`.**
