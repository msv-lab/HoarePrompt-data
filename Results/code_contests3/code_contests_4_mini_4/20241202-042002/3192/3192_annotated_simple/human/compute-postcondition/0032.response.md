The code sets the variable `temp` to 0. The initial state indicates that `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `arr1` hold values based on user input and previous calculations, but those values are not directly affected by this line. Therefore, the only change is that `temp` is now 0 while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from user input, `temp` is 0**
