The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. The previous value of `maxval` is `temp`, which is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`. The value of `arr[i]` is an integer from the `arr` list. Therefore, the new value of `maxval` will be either `temp` or the value of `arr[i]`, depending on which is greater. Other variables remain unaffected.

Since we do not know the specific values of `arr[i]` or `temp`, we will specify that `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of these two values. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`; `j` is `arr1[0]`; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and `temp`.**
