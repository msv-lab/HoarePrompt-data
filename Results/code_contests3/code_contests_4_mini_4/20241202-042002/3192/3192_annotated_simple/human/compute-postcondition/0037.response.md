According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from user input, `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[1]`, `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[2]`, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, and `j` is 3.**
