Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n`, which represents the number of companies. For each company, it processes a list of employee salaries and calculates the maximum salary for each company. It then computes a total value, which is the sum of the product of the difference between the overall maximum salary and each company's maximum salary multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it prints the computed total value. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly. **
