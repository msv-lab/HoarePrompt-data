The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is either `arr1[j]` (with the assumption that `arr1[j] > 0`), the value of `temp` will be updated to the greater of the two. The value of `arr1[j]` is not specified, but since it is accessed with `j` being 2, we assume `arr1` has at least three elements. Additionally, since the loop executes a second time, it implies that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, which does not affect the calculation of `temp`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `temp` based on the values of `temp` and `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is now max(temp, arr1[j]), and `j` is 2.**
