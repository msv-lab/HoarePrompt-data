According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is an integer input that is greater than 2 (since `j` starts from 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, and `j` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is now max(temp, arr1[j]), `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
