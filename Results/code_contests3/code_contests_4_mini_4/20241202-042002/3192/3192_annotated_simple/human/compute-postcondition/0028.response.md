To determine the output state, we first identify the initial state and the impact of the provided code snippet on the variables involved.

1. The variable `arr1[0]` indicates the size of the array `arr1`. If `arr1[0] > 1`, then `temp` holds the maximum value from the elements of `arr1` starting from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, `temp` is 0.
2. The code snippet `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`.

Given that `arr` now includes `temp`, the actual value of `temp` is only relevant if we need to consider the elements of `arr`. However, since `temp` is not directly modified by the code snippet, we only focus on the change happening to `arr2`.

Since `arr1[0]` is being appended to `arr2`, the output state will reflect the current state of `arr2` after this operation. 

Output State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`**
