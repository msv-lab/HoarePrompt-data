According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is an input integer that must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is either `arr1[j]` (assuming `arr1[j] > 0`), and for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
