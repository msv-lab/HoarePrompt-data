According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop is designed to execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since it is specified that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1). 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 (since the loop runs while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`).

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1; `temp` is equal to max(0, arr1[1]); for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
