`arr1` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which takes an input string, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the state of `i` is not affected as it only pertains to the loop. The output state will reflect the new variable created. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input**
