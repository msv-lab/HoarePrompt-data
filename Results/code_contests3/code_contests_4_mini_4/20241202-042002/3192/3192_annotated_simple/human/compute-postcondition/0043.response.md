After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will hold:

- `n` remains the same input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.
- `arr` will contain `n` elements, each being the maximum value found in the corresponding input list `arr1` from each iteration.
- `arr2` will contain `n` elements, each being the first element of each corresponding input list `arr1`, which indicates the number of integers that follow.
- `maxval` will be the maximum value among all the maximum values collected in `arr`, or it will be 0 if no iterations occurred (which won't be the case here since `n` is at least 1).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains `n` elements representing the maximum values from each input list; `arr2` contains `n` elements representing the sizes of each corresponding input list; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`.**
