According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and `n` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. 

Given that `ans` was updated in the previous iteration, we maintain its value since it does not affect the loop's execution condition. 

Thus, if `i` is currently less than `n`, we can determine that for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0], for the loop to execute a second time `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
