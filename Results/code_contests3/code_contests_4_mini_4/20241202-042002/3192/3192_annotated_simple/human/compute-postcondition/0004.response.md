According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The other variables (`arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2`) do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
