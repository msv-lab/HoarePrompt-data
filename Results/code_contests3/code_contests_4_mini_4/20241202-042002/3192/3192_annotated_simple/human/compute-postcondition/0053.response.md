The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates under the constraint that there are `n` companies, each defined by a positive integer `m_i` representing the number of employees followed by `m_i` positive integers representing the salaries of the employees. The function processes this input, which adheres to the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000`, `1 ≤ m_i ≤ 200,000`, and that the total number of employees across all companies does not exceed 200,000. The function returns a value based on the processing of the employee salaries for these companies. 

Functionality: **The function processes input related to `n` companies and their employees' salaries according to specific constraints and returns a result based on this information.**
