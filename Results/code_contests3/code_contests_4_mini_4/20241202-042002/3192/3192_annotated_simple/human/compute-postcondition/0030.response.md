According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value (not specified), and `n` must be greater than this value for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is still less than `n`. 

If we denote the current value of `i` as `current_i`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `current_i + 1`. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

- Increment `i` by 1 (so `i` becomes `current_i + 1`).
- The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than `current_i + 1`.

State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `current_i + 1`**
