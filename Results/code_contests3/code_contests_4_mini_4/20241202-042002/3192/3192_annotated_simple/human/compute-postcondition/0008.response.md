The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The variable `temp` was initially 0, and since the loop executes the first time with the condition that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we assume `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 1) is also greater than 0. The exact value of `arr1[j]` is not specified but is assumed to be a positive integer based on the problem description.

Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`. The state of `arr1` and other variables is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is either `arr1[j]` (assuming `arr1[j] > 0`), and `j` is 1.**
