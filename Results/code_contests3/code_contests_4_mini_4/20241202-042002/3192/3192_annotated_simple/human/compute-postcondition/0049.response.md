According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which indicates that `i` is now equal to the previous incremented value. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be at its new value, which is `i + 1`. Therefore, if `i` was incremented from its previous value, we need to set it to this new value. 

Thus, if `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than this new `i`. 

State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i], `i` is now equal to the previous value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1**
