`arr2` is appended with the value `arr1[0]`, which represents the length of the list `arr1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`; `j` is `arr1[0]`; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`.
