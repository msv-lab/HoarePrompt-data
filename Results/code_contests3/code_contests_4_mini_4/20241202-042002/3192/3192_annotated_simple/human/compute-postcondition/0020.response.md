According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 and going up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. 

Given the current states, `n` being an input integer does not affect the execution of the for loop directly, and `i` is set to 1, which is not relevant to the loop's execution. The `temp` variable is also not relevant. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `arr1` must be a list where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1; `temp` is 0; for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is 1**
