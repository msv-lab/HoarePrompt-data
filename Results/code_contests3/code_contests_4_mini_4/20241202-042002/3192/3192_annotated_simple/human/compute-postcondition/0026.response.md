The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, updating `temp` to the maximum value encountered in the elements of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. After all iterations, `temp` will contain the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` (excluding the first element, which is `arr1[0]`).

If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times, resulting in `temp` being the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

If `arr1[0]` is equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers; `temp` is equal to the maximum of the elements from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
