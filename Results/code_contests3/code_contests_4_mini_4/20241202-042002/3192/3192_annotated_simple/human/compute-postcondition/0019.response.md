The variable `temp` is initialized to 0, and this assignment does not affect any other variables in the current state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input; `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input; `temp` is 0**.
