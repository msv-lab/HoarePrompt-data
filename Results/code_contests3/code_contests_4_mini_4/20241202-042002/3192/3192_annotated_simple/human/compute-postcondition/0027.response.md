The variable `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is determined based on the elements in `arr1`. If `arr1[0]` (the length of `arr1`) is greater than 1, then `temp` is the maximum value of the elements from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, then `temp` is 0. Since the state of `arr` before this operation is unknown, we can only confirm that `temp` has been added to `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` now includes `temp`, where `temp` is the maximum of the elements from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
