The code assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The previous values and states of `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` are not explicitly provided, but since `arr` includes `temp`, it indicates that `arr` has at least one value. The state of `maxval` is also unknown but it will be updated based on the comparison.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`.

Output State: **`arr` includes `temp`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`.**
