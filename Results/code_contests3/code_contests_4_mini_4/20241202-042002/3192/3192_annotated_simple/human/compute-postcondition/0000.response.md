The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000**
