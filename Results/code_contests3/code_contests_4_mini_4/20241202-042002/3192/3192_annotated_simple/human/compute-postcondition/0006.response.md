`temp` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `arr1` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input; `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input; `temp` is 0**
