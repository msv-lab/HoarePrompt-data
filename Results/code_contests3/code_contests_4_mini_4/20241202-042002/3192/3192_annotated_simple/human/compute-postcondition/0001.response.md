In the given code snippet, `arr` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as this line does not affect its value. Therefore, after executing the code, `arr` will hold an empty list while `n` retains its input value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list**
