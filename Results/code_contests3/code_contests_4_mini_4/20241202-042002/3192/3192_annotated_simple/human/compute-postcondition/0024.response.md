According to the code, the continuation of the loop depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `arr1` has at least 3 elements. Given that the loop starts at `j = 1`, we can infer that after the last iteration, `j` would have increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. If we assume that the last value of `j` was `1`, then for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be `2`, and it must be ensured that `arr1[0]` is greater than `2`.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, and `arr1` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute a second time; `j` is 2**
