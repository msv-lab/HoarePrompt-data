To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze how the program works in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input Structure**: 
   - The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of companies.
   - The next `n` lines each describe a company with the first integer representing the number of employees `m_i`, followed by `m_i` salaries.

2. **Merging Condition**: 
   - Companies can be merged if their maximum salaries are equal.
   - If they are not equal, the owners can increase salaries uniformly across the company.

3. **Goal**: 
   - Minimize the total increase in salaries necessary to make all companies mergeable.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads `n` and then iterates over each company to fetch employee salaries.

2. **Finding Maximum Salaries**:
   - For each company, it finds the maximum salary and stores it in `arr`.
   - `arr2` stores the number of employees in each company.

3. **Calculating the Total Increase**:
   - It determines the overall maximum salary (`maxval`).
   - Then, it calculates the total increase needed to raise all salaries in each company to `maxval`.
   - The increase for each company is calculated as `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, summing this for all companies to get the final answer.

### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Salaries Only Increased**: 
   - The program only increases salaries, complying with the union's requirement.

2. **Correctly Identifying Maximum Salaries**:
   - It correctly computes the maximum salary for each company, which is essential for determining merge eligibility.

3. **Total Increase Calculation**:
   - It computes the total increase needed to equalize all maximum salaries to the highest one, ensuring that all companies can be merged in compliance with the merging condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic that satisfies the problem description: it computes the necessary salary increases to ensure that all companies can be merged eventually.

Thus, the final correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
