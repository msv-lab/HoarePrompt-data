The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of companies, followed by `n` lists of employee salaries. It computes the maximum salary for each company and the overall maximum salary across all companies. Then, it calculates the total difference between the maximum salary and the maximum salary of each company, scaled by the number of employees in that company, and prints this total. The function does not return any value but outputs the computed total directly.
