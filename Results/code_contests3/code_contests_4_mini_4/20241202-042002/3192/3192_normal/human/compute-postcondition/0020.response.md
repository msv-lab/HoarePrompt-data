According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 because the range for `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

In the given state, `arr1` is updated from user input, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `maxval` has been updated based on the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must start at 1. Therefore, the state should ensure that `arr1[0]` is at least 2, and `j` is initialized to 1.

State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**
