The code initializes a new list `arr2` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged: `n` is still an input integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is still an empty list, and `maxval` is still 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of companies, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
