The code `arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and then creates a list of these integers assigned to `arr1`. The previous state indicates that `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. The specific values of `arr1` are not provided, but we know they are integers and `arr1[0]` represents the count of elements in `arr1`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `arr1`, the output state will reflect that `arr1` is now updated based on user input. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated from user input; `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`.**
