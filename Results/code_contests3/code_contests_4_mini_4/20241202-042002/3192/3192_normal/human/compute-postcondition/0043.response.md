To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and initial state.

The outer loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer representing the number of companies. For each iteration, the following actions occur:

1. A list `arr1` is created from user input, where the first element `arr1[0]` indicates the number of additional elements in `arr1`.
2. A temporary variable `temp` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum value found among the elements of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`.
3. A nested loop iterates over the elements of `arr1` (from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`) to find the maximum value, which is stored in `temp`.
4. The maximum value found (`temp`) is appended to the list `arr`.
5. The first element of `arr1` (`arr1[0]`) is appended to the list `arr2`.
6. The variable `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the last appended value from `arr`.

After all iterations of the loop have completed, the following conditions will hold:

- `arr` will contain the maximum values from each `arr1` list provided as input during the iterations.
- `arr2` will contain the sizes of each `arr1` list (i.e., the values of `arr1[0]` for each iteration).
- `maxval` will be the maximum of all the values stored in `arr`.

If the loop executed `n` times, we can conclude:

1. `arr` contains `n` elements, each being the maximum value found in the respective `arr1` lists.
2. `arr2` contains `n` elements, each being the size of the corresponding `arr1` in each iteration.
3. `maxval` will be the maximum value across all `temp` values.

If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `arr` remains empty, `arr2` remains empty, and `maxval` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values from each input list, `arr2` contains `n` sizes of the input lists, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr.`**
