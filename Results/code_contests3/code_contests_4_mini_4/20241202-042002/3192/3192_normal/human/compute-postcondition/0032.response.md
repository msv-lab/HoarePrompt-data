The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`arr1`, `n`, `i`, `maxval`, `arr`, `arr2`, `j`) are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State remains consistent with the previous values of the variables while reflecting the updated value of `temp`.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, and the loop can execute a third time if `n` is greater than 2.**
