The value of `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. Since `arr` contains `temp`, and `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, it is likely that `maxval` will be assigned a value that is at least as large as `temp`. The specific value of `arr[i]` is unknown, but it is assumed to be one of the elements in `arr`.

The output state will reflect that `maxval` has been updated based on the comparison. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]**
