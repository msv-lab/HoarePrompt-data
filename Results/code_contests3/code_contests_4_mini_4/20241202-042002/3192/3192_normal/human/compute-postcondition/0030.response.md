According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Since `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is the maximum value among arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0] - 1], `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.**
