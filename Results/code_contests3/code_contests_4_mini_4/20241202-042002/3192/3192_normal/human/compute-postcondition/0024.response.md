According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 3. Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
