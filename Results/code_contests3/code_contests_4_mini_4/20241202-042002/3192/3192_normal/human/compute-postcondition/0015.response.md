`arr2` is an empty list and the code appends `arr1[0]` to it. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr2` will now contain a single element equal to `arr1[0]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`**
