After analyzing the loop and the provided output states, we can deduce the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed.

The loop iterates from `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`, which means it executes `arr1[0] - 1` times if `arr1[0]` is greater than `1`. During each iteration, the variable `temp` is updated to hold the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is the current iteration index.

At the end of the loop:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `maxval` remains 0.
- `arr` remains an empty list.
- `arr2` remains an empty list.
- `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than `1`, meaning it contains at least two elements.
- `temp` contains the maximum value found in the list `arr1` from index `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`.
- `j` will be `arr1[0]`, as it will take the value of the next index after the last iteration.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`.**
