According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `arr1[0]`. Given that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0, these states do not directly impact the loop execution.

However, in order for the loop to execute at least once, `arr1` must contain at least one integer, and that integer must be greater than 1. Since `arr` and `arr2` are empty, they do not affect the loop execution. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` will remain 0 unless modified within the loop body.

For the loop to be executed, `arr1` must be a list with its first element greater than 1, and `j` will initialize to 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
