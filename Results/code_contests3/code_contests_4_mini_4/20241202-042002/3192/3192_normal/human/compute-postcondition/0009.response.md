According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition set by `arr1[0]`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 and will iterate as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, there is potential for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` will increment to 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2, and for this to happen, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or the value of `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
