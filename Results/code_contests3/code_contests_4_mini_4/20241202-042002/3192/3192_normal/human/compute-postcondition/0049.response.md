According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. Since `i` is currently 2 and `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute a third time, `i` must be 3. Given that `n` is greater than 0, it is implied that `n` must also be greater than 2 in order for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
