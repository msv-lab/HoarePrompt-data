Output State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is the maximum value among arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0] - 1], `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, and the loop can execute a third time if `n` is greater than 2.**
