The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The current value of `i` is 1, which means the values `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]` will be used in the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Since `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr` and `arr` contains `n` maximum values, the specific values of `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]` are unknown, but we know they are valid indices based on the initial state where `n` is greater than 0.

Thus, `ans` is updated as follows:
- New value of `ans` is `ans + (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` sizes, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, and `ans` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` sizes, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, and `ans` is updated.**
