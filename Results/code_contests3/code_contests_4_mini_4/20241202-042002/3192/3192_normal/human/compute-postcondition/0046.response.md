The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. Given that `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, the expression `(maxval - arr[i])` will yield a non-negative value since `arr[i]` must be less than or equal to `maxval`. The value of `i` is currently 0, so we are considering the first elements of both `arr` and `arr2`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` sizes, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` sizes, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]**
