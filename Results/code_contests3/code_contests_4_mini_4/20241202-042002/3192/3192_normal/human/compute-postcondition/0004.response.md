According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is empty, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is also empty. These states do not impact the ability of the loop to execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, it is necessary that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list**
