The statement `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` updates the value of `ans`. The value of `i` is 3, so `arr[i]` refers to `arr[3]` and `arr2[i]` refers to `arr2[3]`. The previous values of `maxval`, `arr[3]`, and `arr2[3]` are not specified, but we know that `n` is greater than 0 and that for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

Since we do not have the specific values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2`, we cannot calculate a numeric result. However, we can infer that the value of `ans` is being updated based on these variables. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is updated based on the formula `(maxval - arr[3]) * arr2[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `ans` is updated based on (maxval - arr[3]) * arr2[3]**
