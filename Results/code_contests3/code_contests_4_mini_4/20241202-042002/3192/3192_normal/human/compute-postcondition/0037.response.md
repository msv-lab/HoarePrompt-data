According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `arr1`. The loop iterates over a range defined by `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1[0]` is the upper limit for the loop, and `j` is currently at `arr1[0]`, which means the loop has reached its termination condition for the next iteration.

Since `j` is initialized to start at 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `j`. Consequently, `j` should be incremented to 2 after the current iteration, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, j is 2**
