The `temp` variable is updated to the maximum value between the current `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is 3, so `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[3]`. The previous value of `temp` is not specified, but it is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute a third time is that `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, which does not affect the calculation of `temp`.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[3]), `j` is 3, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time.**
