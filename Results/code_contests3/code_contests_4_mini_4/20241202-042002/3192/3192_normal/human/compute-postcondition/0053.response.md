The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it operates with an implicit input structure described by constraints related to companies and their employee salaries. Specifically, it processes a number `n` representing the number of companies, where each company is associated with a positive integer `m_i` that indicates the number of employees in that company, followed by `m_i` positive integers representing the salaries of those employees. The function is designed to handle constraints on the number of companies, the number of employees within each company, and the maximum salary values.

Based on the provided output criteria, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a series of companies and their corresponding employee salaries, adhering to specified constraints on the number of companies and employees, and it likely computes or returns some aggregated information based on the salary data provided for each company.**
