The statement `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` updates the variable `temp`. We know that `temp` was previously updated to `max(0, arr1[1])`, and `j` is currently 2. The value of `arr1[j]` is `arr1[2]`, but we do not have the specific value of `arr1[2]` available in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp` after this line. 

Since `temp` is updated based on the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, we can conclude that `temp` is either greater than or equal to `max(0, arr1[1])` or equal to `arr1[2]` depending on which is larger.

The other variables remain unchanged, and we can summarize the output state with the known values.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 2, `temp` is either greater than or equal to max(0, arr1[1]) or equal to arr1[2].**
