The code `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. Given that `arr1` is updated from user input and contains values with its first element being `arr1[0]`, and assuming `arr1[0]` is a valid integer, the previous values of the affected variables are checked. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` (now with an additional `arr1[0]` appended), `temp` is the maximum value among arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0] - 1], `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` (now with an additional `arr1[0]` appended), `temp` is the maximum value among arr1[1] to arr1[arr1[0] - 1], `j` is `arr1[0] - 1.**
