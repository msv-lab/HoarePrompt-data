According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, indicating that the loop can execute again. 

For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr1` is updated from user input, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[1]), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
