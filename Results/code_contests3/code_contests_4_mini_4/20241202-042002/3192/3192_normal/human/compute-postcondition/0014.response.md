In the given code, `temp` is being appended to the list `arr`. The variable `temp` is defined as the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, there are elements in `arr1` from which `temp` can be computed. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged.

After executing the code, the state of the variables will be:
- `arr` now contains one element, which is the value of `temp`.
- `n`, `i`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `arr1`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, `j` is `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`**.
