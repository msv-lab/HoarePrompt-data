According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined by `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed again, `n` must be greater than 1, as `i` will become 1 on the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0]`**
