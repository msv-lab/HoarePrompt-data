To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the given initial state and the loop code.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `i` goes from `0` to `n-1`. During each iteration, it updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. 

Let's break down the final output state:

1. After the loop executes `n` times, `i` will have reached its maximum value of `n-1`.
2. The variable `ans` will have accumulated the sum of the products `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
3. Since `arr` contains `n` maximum values and `arr2` contains `n` sizes, both arrays are fully utilized in the calculations.
4. `maxval` remains unchanged throughout the loop, being the maximum value found in `arr`.
5. `n` remains a non-negative integer, representing the number of elements in both `arr` and `arr2`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing:

- `ans` will be the total calculated value based on all elements of `arr` and `arr2`.
- `arr` still contains `n` maximum values.
- `arr2` still contains `n` sizes.
- `maxval` remains the maximum value found in `arr`.
- `n` is still a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`ans` is the total of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` sizes, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`.**
