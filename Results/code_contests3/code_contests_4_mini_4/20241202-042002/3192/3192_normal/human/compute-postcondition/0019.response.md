The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. This value does not depend on any previous calculations or values from other variables, and it directly initializes `temp` to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is updated from user input; `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[i], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]`.
