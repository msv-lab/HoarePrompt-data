The value of `temp` is updated with the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and `j` is computed as `arr1[0] - 1`, which is a valid index since `arr1` has at least 3 elements, making `j` greater than or equal to 2. The value of `arr1[j]` will depend on the specific elements of `arr1`, but since `arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1[j]` will yield a value that is at least equal to `arr1[2]`. 

Thus, `temp` will take the value of `max(0, arr1[j])`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is max(0, arr1[j]), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.

Output State: **`arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is max(0, arr1[j]), `j` is `arr1[0] - 1**
