The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The variable `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, and `temp` is initially calculated as `max(0, arr1[j])`. Since `arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `arr1[j]` also holds a value that is greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to at least `arr1[j]` or retain its previous value if `arr1[j]` is less than `temp`.

So, the previous value of `temp` is taken into account, and `temp` is recalculated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[j]), `j` is `arr1[0]**
