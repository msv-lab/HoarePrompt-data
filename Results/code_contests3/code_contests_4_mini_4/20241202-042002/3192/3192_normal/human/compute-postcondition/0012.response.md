The variable `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 3, we need to find the value of `arr1[3]`. However, the initial state mentions that `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, and it does not provide any specific values for the elements in `arr1`, including `arr1[3]`. Since we don't know the exact values of `temp` or `arr1[3]`, we can only state that `temp` will be updated based on the comparison.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.**
