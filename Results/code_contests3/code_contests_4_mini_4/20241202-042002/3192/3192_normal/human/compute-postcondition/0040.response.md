The code `arr.append(temp)` adds the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. Since `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, the value is appended without changing any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new state of `arr` after appending `temp`.

Output State: **`arr1` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxval` is updated to max(arr[1], maxval), `arr` contains the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] plus temp, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, and `j` is `arr1[0] - 1.**
