The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, we need to check the value of `arr1[2]`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is either 0 or the value of `arr1[1]`. 

Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `arr1` must contain at least 3 elements, meaning `arr1[2]` exists. Thus, `temp` will take the greater of the current `temp` or `arr1[2]`.

The output state reflects this change:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
