The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer representing the number of companies.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of companies**
