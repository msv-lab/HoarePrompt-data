According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. The loop can continue executing as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `arr` contains `n` maximum values, `arr2` contains `n` sizes, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0] for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
