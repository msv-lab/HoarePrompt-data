`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, the value being compared is `arr1[1]`. We know from the initial state that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, but we do not have information about `arr1[1]`. Therefore, `temp` could update to a value greater than 0 if `arr1[1]` is greater than 0. However, without knowing `arr1[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`. Thus, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or the value of `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or the value of `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
