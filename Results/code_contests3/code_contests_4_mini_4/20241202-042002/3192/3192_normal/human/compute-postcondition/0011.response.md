According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, it implies that the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1` must have a value such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `maxval` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3**
