According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, and `temp` is the maximum value in the specified range of `arr1`, or `0` if `arr1` contains only `arr1[0]`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still less than `n`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be increased to `i + 1`.

State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` or `0` if `arr1` contains only `arr1[0]`; `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`; `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is assigned the maximum value from `arr[i]` and `maxval`; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n` and `i` is `i + 1`.**
