According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration. The loop will execute again if `arr1[0]` is greater than 3.

State: **`temp` is updated based on the value of `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 and `j` is 3**
