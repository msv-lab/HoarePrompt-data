The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it likely reads input data related to companies and their employees internally. The function processes information about `n` companies, where each company has a positive integer `m_i` indicating the number of employees and a list of `m_i` positive integers representing the salaries of those employees. The constraints specify that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, each `m_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and the total number of employees across all companies does not exceed 200,000. 

Based on the provided output description, we can infer that the function will return results based on the processed salaries of employees from the companies, but without specific return values given in the output, we cannot detail the exact return behavior.

Functionality: **The function processes data related to multiple companies and their employee salaries and returns results based on that data, without accepting parameters directly.**
