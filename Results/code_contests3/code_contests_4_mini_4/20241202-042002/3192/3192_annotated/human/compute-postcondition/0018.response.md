Output State: **`arr` is a list containing `temp`; `temp` is updated to be the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`; the loop condition is checked for execution based on `n` and `k`.**
