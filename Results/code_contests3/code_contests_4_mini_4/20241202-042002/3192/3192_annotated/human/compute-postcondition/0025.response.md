The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum value between itself and `arr1[j]`. The initial state indicates that `temp` could be either `arr1[1]` or `0`, and since `j` is `2`, the value being compared with `temp` is `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the possible outcomes for `temp` are either `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` or `max(0, arr1[2])`. The other variables are not explicitly mentioned to change.

Thus, the Output State is: `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`; `temp` is either `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` or `max(0, arr1[2])`, and `j` is 2.
Output State: **`temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`; `temp` is either `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` or `max(0, arr1[2])`, and `j` is 2.**
