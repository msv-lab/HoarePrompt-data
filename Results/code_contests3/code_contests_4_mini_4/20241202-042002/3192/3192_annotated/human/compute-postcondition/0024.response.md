According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `arr1[0]`. The index `j` starts at 1 and goes up to (but does not include) `arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at 1, and since the loop can execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`; `temp` is either `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` or `max(0, arr1[2])`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be 2.**
