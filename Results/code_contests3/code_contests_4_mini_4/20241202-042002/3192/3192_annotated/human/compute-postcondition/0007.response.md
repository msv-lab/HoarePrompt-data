According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from input. To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `arr1` contains at least one integer and that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 

After the first execution of the loop, `j` is initialized to 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the states to reflect that `arr1` has at least one element and that the first element of `arr1` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
