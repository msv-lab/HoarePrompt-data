The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is defined as the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise it is 0. 

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is an empty list
- `temp` is calculated based on the conditions provided.

If `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` will hold the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. If `arr1[0]` is 1, `temp` will be 0.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `arr` with the new value appended.

Output State: **`arr` is now a list containing `temp`, where `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
