According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently set to `1` (since the loop starts at `1`), and `arr1[0]` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute one more time. 

If `temp` is `arr1[1]` (which is greater than `0`), that means the loop has executed with `j` being `1`. To execute the loop a second time, `j` will be incremented to `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `2`.

If `temp` is `0`, that means `arr1[1]` was `0`, and the loop has still executed with `j` being `1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must still be greater than `2` to allow `j` to increment to `2`.

So, in both scenarios, the important states to adjust are `j` and the condition on `arr1[0]`.

State: **`temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than `2`, and `j` is `2`**
