`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 3, we look at `arr1[3]` to determine the new value of `temp`. The previous value of `temp` is `arr1[1]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, we can assume that `arr1` has at least 4 elements. The exact values in `arr1` are unknown, but `arr1[j]` (or `arr1[3]`) is compared against `temp`. The output state will reflect the update of `temp`, which is now the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is updated to the maximum of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.**
