The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is not specified, but it is within the range of 1 to 200,000. Other variables and states are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
