According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and we know that `n` is greater than 1, which means there is at least one more iteration possible. 

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 for the next iteration, the new value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`ans` is updated to include `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
