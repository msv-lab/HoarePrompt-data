`arr1` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, which is split into individual string elements and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `arr1` now contains the integer values inputted by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
