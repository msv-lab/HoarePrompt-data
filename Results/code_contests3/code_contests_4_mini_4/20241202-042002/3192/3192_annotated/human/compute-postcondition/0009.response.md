According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which dictates the upper limit of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1` has at least one element and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. If `j` is currently 1, the loop can execute again as long as `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. After this iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is equal to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
