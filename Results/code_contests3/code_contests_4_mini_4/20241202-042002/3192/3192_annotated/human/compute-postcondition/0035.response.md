According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`temp` is updated based on the value of `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
