According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0 and going up to `n-1`. The state of `ans` does not affect the execution of the loop, but it will be adjusted during the loop iterations.

For the loop to execute for the first time, the variable `i` must be set to 0, which is its initial value at the start of the loop. Additionally, since `n` needs to be at least 1 for the loop to run, we can conclude that `n` is valid as per the given constraints.

State: **`ans` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
