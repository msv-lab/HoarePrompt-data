According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is equal to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 3; `temp` is updated to the maximum of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`.**
