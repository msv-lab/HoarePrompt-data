The code initializes an empty list `arr2`. The existing variables `n`, `arr`, and `maxval` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list**.
