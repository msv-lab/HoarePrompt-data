Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` or `0` if `arr1` contains only `arr1[0]`; `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`; `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is assigned the maximum value from `arr[i]` and `maxval`; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n` and `i` is `i + 1; `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from input.**
