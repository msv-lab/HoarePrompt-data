To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet:

- The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
- The loop is set to execute, indicating that `n` is at least 1.
- The operation performed is `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, which updates `ans` based on the values in `arr` and `arr2` at index `i`.

Since `i` is currently 0, the expression evaluates as follows:
- `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`.
- `arr2[i]` refers to `arr2[0]`.
- `maxval` is a value that is defined outside this context but is necessary for the calculation.

The value of `ans` will change based on the calculation involving `maxval`, `arr[0]`, and `arr2[0]`. However, since the specific values of `maxval`, `arr[0]`, and `arr2[0]` are not provided, we can only describe the change in terms of their relationship.

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `ans` as a result of the operation described:

Output State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`, `i` is 0.**
