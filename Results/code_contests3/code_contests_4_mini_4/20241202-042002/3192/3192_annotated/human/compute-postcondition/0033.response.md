According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop executes for `j` starting from 1 and going up to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented and remain less than `arr1[0]`. 

Before the loop starts:
- `temp` is 0, which does not affect the loop execution.
- `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, so that `j` can take a value of 1 initially and then increment to 2 for the second iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute the second time:
1. `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.
2. Before the first iteration, `j` is 1 (the first value of the loop).

State: **`temp` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `i` is still less than `n`.**
