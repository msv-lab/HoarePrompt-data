Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`; `arr` now includes `temp` appended to it; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`.**
