To determine the impact of the code on the program, we analyze the provided variables.

1. The variable `ans` is updated based on the previous calculation `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`, which means it has a specific numerical value based on that calculation.
2. The variable `i` is currently 1.
3. The code snippet updates `ans` by adding to it the value calculated from `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Since `i` is 1, we will substitute `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]` into the equation.
4. The loop will execute a second time as `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `ans` after incorporating the new calculation.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to include `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`, `i` is 1, and the loop continues as `n` is greater than 1.**
