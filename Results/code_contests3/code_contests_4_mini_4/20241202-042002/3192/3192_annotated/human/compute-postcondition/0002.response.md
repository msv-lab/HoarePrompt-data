The variable `maxval` is initialized to 0. The initial values of `n` and `arr` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `n` and `arr`, while `maxval` is now defined as 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
