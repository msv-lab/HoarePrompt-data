The function `func` processes input data regarding multiple companies and their employees' salaries. It first reads an integer `n`, which specifies the number of companies, and then for each company, it reads a list of salaries. The function computes the maximum salary among the employees of each company and stores these values in a list. It then determines the overall maximum salary across all companies. 

Subsequently, the function calculates a total value `ans`, which represents the sum of differences between this overall maximum salary and the maximum salary of each company, multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it outputs this accumulated sum.

The function does not explicitly accept parameters but reads input directly from standard input. 

Functionality: ** The function reads the number of companies and their employees' salaries, calculates the maximum salary for each company, finds the overall maximum salary, and computes the total sum of differences between this overall maximum and each company's maximum salary multiplied by the number of employees in that company, then prints the result. **
