To evaluate the impact of the code snippet provided, we need to analyze the initial state and how the code affects the variables involved.

- The variable `temp` is initially `0`.
- The variable `arr1[j]` needs to be evaluated where `j` is `1`. For the loop to execute the first time, we assume `arr1[0]` is greater than `1`, but we do not have any specific information on the value of `arr1[1]`.
- The expression `max(temp, arr1[j])` will compare `temp` (which is `0`) with `arr1[1]`.

Since `arr1[1]` is unknown in terms of its specific value, but it exists, we can deduce that:

- If `arr1[1]` is greater than `0`, `temp` will be assigned that value. 
- If `arr1[1]` is equal to `0`, `temp` will remain `0`.

Thus, after this operation, the value of `temp` will either be `arr1[1]` (if it is greater than `0`) or remain `0` (if `arr1[1]` is `0`).

The output state will reflect these possibilities:

Output State: **`temp` is either `arr1[1]` (if greater than `0`) or `0` (if `arr1[1]` is `0`)**
