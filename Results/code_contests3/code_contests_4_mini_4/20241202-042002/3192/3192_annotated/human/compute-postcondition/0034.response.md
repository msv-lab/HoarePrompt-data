Given the initial state, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute the second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `i` is still less than `n`. 

The code `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` updates the value of `temp` to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is currently 0, the new value of `temp` will depend on the value of `arr1[j]`. 

Assuming that `arr1[j]` is defined and valid, if `arr1[j]` is greater than 0, `temp` will be updated to that value. The specific value of `arr1[j]` is not provided, but we know that `temp` will either remain 0 or be updated to the value of `arr1[j]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is updated based on the value of `arr1[j]`, which is not specified; `j` is still 1.

Output State: **`temp` is updated based on the value of `arr1[j]`, `j` is 1**
