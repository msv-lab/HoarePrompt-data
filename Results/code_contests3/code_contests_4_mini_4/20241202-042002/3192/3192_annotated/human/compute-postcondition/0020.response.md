According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. The initial state mentions `arr` and `temp`, but does not provide specific information about `arr1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `arr1[0]` needs to be greater than 1, and `j` should start at 1. 

State: **`arr` is a list containing `temp`, `temp` is 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 and `j` is 1**
