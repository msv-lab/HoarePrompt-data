According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still within the range of `n`, and `arr` contains `temp`, which is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it will now be `k + 1`. Also, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing `temp`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `k + 1`**
