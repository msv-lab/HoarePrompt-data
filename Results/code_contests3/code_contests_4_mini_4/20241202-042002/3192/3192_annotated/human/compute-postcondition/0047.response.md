According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

State: **`ans` is updated based on the calculation `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
