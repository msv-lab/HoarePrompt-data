To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we note the following:

1. The variable `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`.
2. The value of `j` is `2`.
3. The expression `max(temp, arr1[j])` will determine the new value of `temp` based on the greater of the current value of `temp` and the value of `arr1[2]`.

Since `arr1[0]` must be greater than `2` for the loop to execute a second time, we can infer that `arr1` has at least three elements. However, since the exact value of `arr1[2]` is not provided, we can only express the relationship between `temp` and `arr1[2]`.

Given these points, we can summarize the impact of the code:

- `temp` is assigned the greater value between its current value and `arr1[2]`.
- Therefore, the possible new values of `temp` depend on the comparison between its original value and `arr1[2]`.

Thus, the output state is: `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`, and after the code execution, `temp` is either `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` or `max(0, arr1[2])`.

Output State: **`temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `0`; `temp` is either `max(arr1[1], arr1[2])` or `max(0, arr1[2])`**.
