To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet and the initial state provided.

Initial State: `arr` is now a list containing `temp`, where `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0.

The line of code `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The value of `arr1[0]` is not specified in the initial state, but it will be added to `arr2`.

Since `arr` and `temp` are not affected by this operation, their values remain the same.

The output state will reflect the unchanged nature of `arr` and `temp`, while also indicating that `arr1[0]` has been appended to `arr2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing `temp`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`.**
