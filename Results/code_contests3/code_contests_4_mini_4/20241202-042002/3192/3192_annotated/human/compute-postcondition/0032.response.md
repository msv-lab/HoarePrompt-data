Output State: **`temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains `temp` appended to it, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value from `arr[i]` and `maxval`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n` and `i` is `i + 1; `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from input.**
