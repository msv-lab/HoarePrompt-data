The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` is an element of `arr1` at index `j`, where `j` is currently 1. Given that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr1[1]` must also be an integer that is either greater than 1 or equal to it, assuming the list has at least two elements. 

After executing the code, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value of 0 and `arr1[1]`. The value of `temp` will now be equal to `arr1[1]`, given that it is greater than 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is equal to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is equal to `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**.
