The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is -1, the calculation results in `ans` being 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object containing integers from raw_input split into a list, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object containing integers from raw_input split into a list, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1**
