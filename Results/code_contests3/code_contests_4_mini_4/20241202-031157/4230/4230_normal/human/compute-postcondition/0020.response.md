The function accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of doors, and a list of integers `c` that consists of values either 0 (left exit) or 1 (right exit). The function iterates through the list from the second-to-last element to the first, looking for the last index where the value changes from one exit type to the next. If such a change is found, it stores the index of that change in `ans`, which is then printed. If no change occurs, `ans` remains 0. The function guarantees that there is at least one exit of each type in the list. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `c` of integers (0s and 1s) representing exits. It returns the index of the last change in exit type in the list, or 0 if no change occurs. **
