`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` must be 0 for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `ans` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object containing integers from raw_input split into a list, `ans` is 1, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object containing integers from raw_input split into a list, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0**
