The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `sequence`. Here, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 (for left exit) or 1 (for right exit). The function guarantees that there is at least one 0 and one 1 in the list. 

The functionality of the function is to analyze the `sequence` of opened doors. Based on the arrangement of 0s and 1s in the sequence, the function will return specific outputs that are determined by the first and last elements of the `sequence`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `sequence`, and returns specific outputs based on the arrangement of 0s and 1s in `sequence`.**
