The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is at least 2, the minimum value for `i` is 0 (when `n` is 2). Thus, `ans` will be at least 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object containing integers from raw_input split into a list, `ans` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `c` are not equal.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object containing integers from raw_input split into a list, `ans` is at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `c` are not equal.**
