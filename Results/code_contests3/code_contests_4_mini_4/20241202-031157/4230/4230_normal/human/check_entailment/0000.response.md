To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
Mr. Black opens doors in a particular sequence, and we need to determine the smallest index \( k \) such that after opening the first \( k \) doors, Mr. Black can exit the house through either the left or right exit. The exits are represented by 0s (left) and 1s (right) in the list.

### Program Analysis:
The provided code reads the number of doors and the sequence in which they are opened. It iterates through the list of doors in reverse order, looking for the last change in exit type (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). It sets the index \( ans \) to the position where this change occurs, which is then printed.

### Output Hints:
The hints state that the function returns the index of the last change in exit type in the list, or 0 if no change occurs.

### Evaluation of the Code:
1. **Logic of the program**: The program does not directly count how many doors are present for each exit (0s and 1s). Instead, it looks for the last position where the exit type changes. This is not aligned with the problem description because Mr. Black can exit only when all doors in at least one exit are open, not merely when there's a transition from 0 to 1 or vice versa.

2. **Missing Logic**: The logic fails to check whether all doors of at least one exit are open after \( k \) doors. Therefore, it does not correctly determine when Mr. Black can exit the house.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the edge case where the sequence is all 0s followed by all 1s (e.g., [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]). The program would return the index of the last change, which would not represent a valid exit condition since Mr. Black could exit only after all doors (0s) are opened before any 1s are opened.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases (especially for the exit condition), it is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly determine the smallest index \( k \) after which Mr. Black can exit the house as required by the problem statement.
