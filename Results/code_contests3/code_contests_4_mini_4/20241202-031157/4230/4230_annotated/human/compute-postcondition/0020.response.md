Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of doors followed by a sequence of `n` integers (0 or 1) indicating the exit direction of each door. It then iterates through the list of doors from the second-to-last index to the first, checking for the first position where the exit direction changes. The function prints the index of that position plus one (1-based index). If no such position exists, it prints 0. The function assumes valid input as specified and does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or where the input does not conform to the expected format. **
