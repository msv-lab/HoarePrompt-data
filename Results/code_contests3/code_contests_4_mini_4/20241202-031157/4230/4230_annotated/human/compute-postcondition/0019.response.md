The function `func` does not accept any input parameters directly. Instead, it operates on standard input consisting of an integer `n`, which represents the number of doors (with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), followed by a sequence of `n` integers, where each integer is either 0 (indicating a door in the left exit) or 1 (indicating a door in the right exit). It is guaranteed that there is at least one door in the left exit and at least one door in the right exit. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read from the standard input and process the sequence of doors to generate an output based on the provided criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts standard input consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) followed by n integers (each being 0 or 1) representing doors, and processes this input to return an output based on the configuration of the doors.**
