The code assigns `c` the result of mapping the `int` function over the values that are input as a space-separated string. The initial state does not affect the values of `c`, but it indicates that `n` could be either 0 or 1. The variable `c` will hold an iterable of integers, depending on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the original sequence, which is either 0 or 1; `c` is an iterable of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the original sequence, which is either 0 or 1; `c` is an iterable of integers from the input.**
