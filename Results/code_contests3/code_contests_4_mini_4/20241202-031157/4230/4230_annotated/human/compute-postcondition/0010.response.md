`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is -1, so `ans` becomes -1 + 1, which equals 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2, `i` is -1, `c` is an iterable of integers, and `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `i` is -1, `c` is an iterable of integers, `ans` is 0**
