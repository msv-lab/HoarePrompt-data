According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the range defined by `n`. The loop is set to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, with the initial value of `i` at the end of the last iteration being -1. 

Since `n` is 2, `n - 2` equals 0, meaning the loop will execute for `i` values starting from 0 down to -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which is less than the starting value of `0`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `0`, and the loop will run for that value. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be updated to `0`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2, since this is the condition for the loop's range.

State: **`n` is 2, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute a second time `c` must have at least 2 elements.**
