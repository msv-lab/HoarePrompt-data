`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the value of `ans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an iterable of integers, `ans` is 1. 

Output State: **`n` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an iterable of integers, `ans` is 1**
