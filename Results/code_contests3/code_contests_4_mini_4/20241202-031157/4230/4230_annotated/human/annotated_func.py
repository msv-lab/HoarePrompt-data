#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it operates on the standard input, which consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of doors, followed by a sequence of n integers where each integer is either 0 (indicating a door in the left exit) or 1 (indicating a door in the right exit). It is guaranteed that there is at least one door in the left exit and at least one door in the right exit.
def func():
    n = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = n[0]
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
            ans = i + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least 0, `c` is an iterable of integers, `ans` is 0 if n is 0 or 1, or `ans` is 1 if `n` is 2 and `c[0]` is not equal to `c[1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of doors followed by a sequence of `n` integers (0 or 1) indicating the exit direction of each door. It then iterates through the list of doors from the second-to-last index to the first, checking for the first position where the exit direction changes. The function prints the index of that position plus one (1-based index). If no such position exists, it prints 0. The function assumes valid input as specified and does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2 or where the input does not conform to the expected format.
