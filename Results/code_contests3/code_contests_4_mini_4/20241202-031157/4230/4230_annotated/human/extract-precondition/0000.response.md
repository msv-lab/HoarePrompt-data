Precondition: **The function does not take any input parameters, but it operates on the standard input, which consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of doors, followed by a sequence of n integers where each integer is either 0 (indicating a door in the left exit) or 1 (indicating a door in the right exit). It is guaranteed that there is at least one door in the left exit and at least one door in the right exit.**
