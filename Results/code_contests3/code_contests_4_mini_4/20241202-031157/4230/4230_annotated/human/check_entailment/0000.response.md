Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues:

1. **Logic for Finding Exit**: The problem states that Mr. Black can exit if all doors in at least one of the exits are open after opening the first `k` doors. However, the program is only checking for the first index where the exit direction changes (i.e., where it goes from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`). This does not guarantee that all doors in one of the exits are open.

2. **Iterating in Reverse**: The program iterates backward from the second-to-last index to the first, which does not align with the requirement of determining how many doors need to be opened from the beginning of the list to achieve an exit condition.

3. **Incorrect Index Calculation**: The index found (if any) is only based on a change of direction in the door sequence, which does not correlate to the condition of having all doors in one exit open. The program simply checks for the first occurrence of a change between `0` and `1` instead of counting the number of doors opened in both exits.

4. **Output Logic**: The output is simply the found index plus one, which does not represent the total number of doors that need to be opened for either exit to be completely open, as required by the problem.

In summary, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly determine the smallest `k` such that Mr. Black can exit the house, by failing to check the number of doors opened for both exits correctly. Thus, the program is incorrect.
