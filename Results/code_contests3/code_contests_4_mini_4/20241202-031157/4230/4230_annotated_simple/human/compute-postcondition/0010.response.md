`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we can express `ans` as `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is `n - 2**
