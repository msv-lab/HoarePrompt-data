According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will start executing if `n` is greater than 1 because the range will generate values from `n - 2` down to `0`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the loop will not execute at all, as there will be no valid starting point for `i`. 

Given that `ans` is 0, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute. 

For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2, which means that `i` starts at `n - 2` and will go down to 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**.
