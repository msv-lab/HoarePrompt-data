According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1, which means `i` will become `n - 4`. 

Since `n` is at least 2, this means that `n - 4` will be greater than or equal to `-2`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 4`, and it will check the condition of `i` being greater than or equal to `0`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 4`, `ans` is 0 for the loop to execute again.**
