According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop starts at `n - 2` and decrements `i` with each iteration until it reaches `-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, which means it will be decremented to `n - 3` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `-1`, which it will be after decrementing. Since `n` is at least 2, `i` will be `n - 3`, which is still valid as long as `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 3`, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `c[i]` must be compared to `c[i + 1]` where `i` is `n - 3`**
