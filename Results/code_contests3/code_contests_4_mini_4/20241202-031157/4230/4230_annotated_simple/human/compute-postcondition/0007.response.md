The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - 1`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or structure.
