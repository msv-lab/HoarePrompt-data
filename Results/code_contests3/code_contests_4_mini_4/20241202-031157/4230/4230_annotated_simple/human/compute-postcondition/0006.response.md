`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `ans` will be `(n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - 1`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `n - 1`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal.**
