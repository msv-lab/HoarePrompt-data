The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and `opened_doors`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in `opened_doors` is either 0 (indicating a door in the left exit) or 1 (indicating a door in the right exit), with the condition that there is at least one 0 and one 1 in the list. 

The function will evaluate the sequence of opened doors and will return a specific output depending on the configuration of these doors. However, the exact output based on the combinations of the opened doors is not specified here.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of integers opened_doors (containing at least one 0 and one 1), and returns a result based on the configuration of the opened doors.**
