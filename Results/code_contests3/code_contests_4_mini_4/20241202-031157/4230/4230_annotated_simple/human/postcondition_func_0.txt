The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a list of integers representing opened doors, where each integer is either 0 (left exit) or 1 (right exit). It identifies the last index where the door configuration changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, returning that index. If all doors are the same (either all 0s or all 1s), the function will return 0. It does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format, such as non-integer values.
