Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. The main issue lies in how it determines the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, Mr. Black can exit the house.

Here's a breakdown of the problems in the program:

1. **Logic of Finding `k`:** The program tries to find the first index where the door type changes (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) by iterating backward from the second to last door. However, this does not guarantee that all doors in either exit are open by that index. The problem requires checking if all doors in one of the exits are open after opening the first `k` doors.

2. **Counting Open Doors:** The program does not keep track of how many doors from each exit (left or right) have been opened. To determine if Mr. Black can exit, we need to know when all left doors (0s) or all right doors (1s) have been opened.

3. **Output Value:** The program simply outputs the last index where `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, which does not reflect the correct point at which all doors to one of the exits are open.

To summarize, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements because it fails to correctly identify the smallest index `k` where Mr. Black can exit based on the count of opened doors in both exits. Instead, it incorrectly focuses on the transition points between different door types. 

A correct implementation would involve counting the number of opened doors for both exits and determining the exit point based on when one of the counts reaches the total number of doors for that exit.
