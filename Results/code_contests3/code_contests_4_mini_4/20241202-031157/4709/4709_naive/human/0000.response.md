Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The task is to read a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters and then print the string formed by the characters on the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right corner. 

However, the program incorrectly attempts to read input and perform operations unrelated to the grid. It uses `raw_input()` to read a single line of input, splits it incorrectly, and tries to perform calculations based on the assumption of integer input, which is not relevant to the problem. 

For example, if the input is:
```
ant
obe
rec
```
The expected output should be `abc`, which is formed by the characters `a`, `b`, and `c` from the grid. Instead, the program will not produce the correct output and will raise an error due to incorrect indexing and handling of the input.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality, making it incorrect.
