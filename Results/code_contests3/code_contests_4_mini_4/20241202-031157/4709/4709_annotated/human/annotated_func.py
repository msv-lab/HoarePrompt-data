#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as three lines of three characters each.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of the rows of the grid from the string input, `A` is the first row of the grid which is `l[0]`, `B` is the second row of the grid which is `l[1]`, and `ans` is set to 1 if the integer value of `A` equals the integer value of `B`.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `ans` is 1 plus the count of integers between `int(A)` and `int(B)` that satisfy the condition `C[0] == C[4]` and `C[1] == C[3]`, and `int(B)` is greater than `int(A)`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters as input and compares the integer values of the first two rows of the grid. If they are equal, it initializes a counter `ans` to 1. It then iterates through all integers between the first and second integer values (exclusive), checking if the first and last characters of their string representation are equal and if the second and fourth characters are equal. The function counts how many integers satisfy this condition and adds this count to `ans`, which is then printed. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include the scenario where the integer values of `A` and `B` are equal, resulting in the loop not executing, hence only returning 1 if they are equal. Additionally, if `int(B)` is less than `int(A)`, an empty loop would run, and `ans` would remain 0, leading to no output reflecting that situation.
