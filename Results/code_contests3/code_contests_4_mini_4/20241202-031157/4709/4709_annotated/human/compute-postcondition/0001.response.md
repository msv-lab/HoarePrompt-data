The variable `a` is assigned a string input from the user, which represents a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. The `split()` method is called on `a`, which splits the string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Therefore, after execution, `l` will contain the individual rows of the grid as separate elements in a list. The state of `a` will remain unchanged, while `l` will be a list of three elements (assuming the input consists of three rows). 

Output State: **`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of the rows of the grid from the string input.**
