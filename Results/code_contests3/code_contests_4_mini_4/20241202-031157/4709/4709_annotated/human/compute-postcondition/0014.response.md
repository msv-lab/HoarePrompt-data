The variable `i` is assigned the value of `int(A) + 1`. The code `C = list(str(i))` converts `i` to a string and then creates a list of its characters. The value of `i` is not specified in terms of a specific value, but it is calculated based on `A`. Therefore, the output state reflects the list `C` created from the string representation of `i`. 

Output State: **`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `int(B)` must be greater than `int(A) + 1`, `i` is `int(A) + 1`, `C` is a list of characters of the string representation of `i`.**
