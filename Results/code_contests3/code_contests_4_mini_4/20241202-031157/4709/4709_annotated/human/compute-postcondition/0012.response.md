Postcondition: ***`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. If the first and last characters of the string representation of `i` are equal and the second and fourth characters are equal, `ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `int(A)`, where `A` is the first row of the grid, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`.***
