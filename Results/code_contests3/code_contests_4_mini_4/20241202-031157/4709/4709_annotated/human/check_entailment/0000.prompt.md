You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a 3Ã—3 square grid, where each square contains a lowercase English letters. The letter in the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is c_{ij}.

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters in the squares on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Constraints

* Input consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}
c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}
c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}


Output

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Examples

Input

ant
obe
rec


Output

abc


Input

edu
cat
ion


Output

ean
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as three lines of three characters each.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list of the rows of the grid from the string input, `A` is the first row of the grid which is `l[0]`, `B` is the second row of the grid which is `l[1]`, and `ans` is set to 1 if the integer value of `A` equals the integer value of `B`.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `ans` is 1 plus the count of integers between `int(A)` and `int(B)` that satisfy the condition `C[0] == C[4]` and `C[1] == C[3]`, and `int(B)` is greater than `int(A)`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters as input and compares the integer values of the first two rows of the grid. If they are equal, it initializes a counter `ans` to 1. It then iterates through all integers between the first and second integer values (exclusive), checking if the first and last characters of their string representation are equal and if the second and fourth characters are equal. The function counts how many integers satisfy this condition and adds this count to `ans`, which is then printed. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include the scenario where the integer values of `A` and `B` are equal, resulting in the loop not executing, hence only returning 1 if they are equal. Additionally, if `int(B)` is less than `int(A)`, an empty loop would run, and `ans` would remain 0, leading to no output reflecting that situation.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
