The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes an input string from the user. Since the initial state specifies that the input consists of three lines, each containing three lowercase English letters, the value of `a` will be a string that represents the first line of input. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first line of input consisting of three lowercase English letters.

Output State: **`a` is the first line of input consisting of three lowercase English letters.**
