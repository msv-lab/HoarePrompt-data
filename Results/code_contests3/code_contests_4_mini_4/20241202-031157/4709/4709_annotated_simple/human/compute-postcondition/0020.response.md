Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters; `ans` is 2 if the first character of the list `C` equals the fifth character and the second character equals the fourth character; `int(A)` is less than `int(B) - 1; `i` is `int(A) + 2; `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If the condition is not met, `ans` remains 1.***
