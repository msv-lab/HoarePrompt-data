The variable `ans` is assigned the value `1`, changing its previous value of `0`. The other variables (`a`, `l`, `A`, `B`) remain unaffected in terms of their values. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, and `ans` is now 1.

Output State: **`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list created by splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, and `ans` is now 1.**
