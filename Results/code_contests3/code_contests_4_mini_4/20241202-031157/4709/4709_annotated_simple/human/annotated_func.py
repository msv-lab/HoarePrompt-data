#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines, each containing three lowercase English letters, forming a 3x3 grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string of three lowercase English letters. If the integer values of the first two letters `A` and `B` are equal, then `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string of three lowercase English letters; `ans` is the count of times `C[0]` equals `C[4]` and `C[1]` equals `C[3]` during all iterations; `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`; `i` is `int(B) - 1`; `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, processes the first two lines of input as integers `A` and `B`, and counts specific character matches in the integer range from `A` to `B - 1`. If `A` equals `B`, it sets the count to 1, but it does not handle input validation or the expected 3x3 grid format properly.
