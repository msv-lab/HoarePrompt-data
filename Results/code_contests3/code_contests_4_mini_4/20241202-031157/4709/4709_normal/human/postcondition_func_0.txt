The function accepts two integer inputs represented as strings from user input, compares them, and initializes a count. It then iterates through the range of integers between these two values (exclusive) and counts how many of those integers, when converted to a string, have the first character equal to the fifth character and the second character equal to the fourth character. It prints the total count, which includes an additional count if the two integer inputs are equal. However, the code does not handle cases where the first integer is greater than the second, nor does it validate the input format, which could lead to errors if the inputs are not valid integers.
