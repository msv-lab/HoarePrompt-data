#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a 3x3 grid represented by three strings of three lowercase English letters each, where each string corresponds to a row of the grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, and `ans` is the total count of integers between `int(A)` and `int(B)` that meet the character conditions described in the loop, plus 1 if `int(A)` is equal to `int(B)`, otherwise 0.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer inputs represented as strings from user input, compares them, and initializes a count. It then iterates through the range of integers between these two values (exclusive) and counts how many of those integers, when converted to a string, have the first character equal to the fifth character and the second character equal to the fourth character. It prints the total count, which includes an additional count if the two integer inputs are equal. However, the code does not handle cases where the first integer is greater than the second, nor does it validate the input format, which could lead to errors if the inputs are not valid integers.
