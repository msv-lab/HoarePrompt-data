Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, `ans` is 2 if `int(A)` is equal to `int(B)` otherwise 1. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C`, and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is set to 2; otherwise, it remains 1.***
