The variable `i` is assigned the value `int(A) + 2`. The code then creates a list `C` by converting `i` to a string and then creating a list of its characters. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`.

Output State: **`l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`**.
