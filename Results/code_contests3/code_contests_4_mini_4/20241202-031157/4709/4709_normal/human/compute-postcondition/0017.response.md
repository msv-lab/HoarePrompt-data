According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(B)`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` contains three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, and `i` is `int(A) + 1`. 

Given that `i` is `int(A) + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `int(A) + 1` must be less than `int(B)`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `int(A) + 2`. 

For the loop to execute again, `int(A) + 2` must be less than `int(B)`. Thus, we can summarize the updated states as follows:

State: **`l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `int(B)` must be greater than `int(A) + 2`**
