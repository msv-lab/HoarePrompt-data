Postcondition: ***`l` is a list containing three strings, `A` is the first string from the list `l`, `B` is the second string from the list `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
