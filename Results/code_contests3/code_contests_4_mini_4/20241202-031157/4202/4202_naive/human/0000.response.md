To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and its adherence to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to convert string `a` into string `b` using two operations:
  1. Append the parity of `a` (1 if odd number of `1`s, 0 otherwise) to the end of `a`.
  2. Remove the first character of `a` (not allowed if `a` is empty).

### Program Analysis:
The program reads two binary strings `a` and `b`, then counts the number of `1`s in both strings:
```python
pa = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pa += i == '1'
pb = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pb += i == '1'
```
It then checks if the count of `1`s in `a` (denoted as `pa`) is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in `b` (denoted as `pb`), and prints "YES" if it is, and "NO" otherwise:
```python
print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```

### Incorrectness:
The logic of the program is flawed because it only checks the counts of `1`s in both strings. However, it does not account for the actual structure of the strings or the operations required to transform `a` into `b`. 

**Counterexample:**
Consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  a = "000"
  b = "1"
  ```
- In this case, `pa` (number of `1`s in `a`) is `0` and `pb` (number of `1`s in `b`) is `1`. The program will output "NO", which is correct. However, if we take:
- Input:
  ```
  a = "011"
  b = "1"
  ```
- Here, `pa` is `2` (since there are two `1`s in `a`) and `pb` is `1` (one `1` in `b`). The program will output "YES". However, it's impossible to transform "011" to "1" without removing characters, which the program does not verify.

This shows that the program fails to cover cases where the transformation is not feasible based on the actual content of the strings, only focusing on the counts of `1`s.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if `a` can be transformed into `b` since it overlooks the operation specifics and structure of the strings.

Correctness: **False**.
