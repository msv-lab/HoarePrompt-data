According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input received from `raw_input()`. Since `raw_input()` typically waits for user input, it will execute at least once as long as the user provides some input. The variables `a` and `b` are already defined as non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1', while `pa` counts the '1's during the loop execution and `pb` is initialized to 0.

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i`, which will take on the value of each character input from `raw_input()`, will be initialized to the first character of the provided input string. Since `a` and `b` are already defined and non-empty, and given that the loop will execute at least once, the state needs to include the initial value of `i`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input during loop execution, `pb` is 0, `i` is the first character of the input received from raw_input()**
