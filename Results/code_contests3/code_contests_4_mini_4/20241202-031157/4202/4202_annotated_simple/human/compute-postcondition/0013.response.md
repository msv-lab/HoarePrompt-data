According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input received from `raw_input()`. If the input contains more characters, the loop will execute for each character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of the input, meaning the loop has processed at least the first character already. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the input string must have at least three characters, since `i` would be the second character in the string. After this iteration, `i` will become the third character. 

Therefore, to execute the loop a third time, the states need to be adjusted accordingly:

State: **`a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input during loop execution, `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1', `i` is the third character of the input received from raw_input()**
