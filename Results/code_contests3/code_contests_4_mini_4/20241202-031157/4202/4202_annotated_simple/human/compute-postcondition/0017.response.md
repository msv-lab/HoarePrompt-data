The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates on two non-empty strings `a` and `b` that consist only of the characters '0' and '1'. The lengths of these strings are between 1 and 1000. The function's output behavior is not provided, so we cannot determine specific return values or cases based on the input strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-empty strings `a` and `b`, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', with lengths between 1 and 1000. The specific return value is not defined.**
