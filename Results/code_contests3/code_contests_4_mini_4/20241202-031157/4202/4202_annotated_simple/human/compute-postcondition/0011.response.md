According to the code, the loop iterates over each character of the string received from `raw_input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the input string. Since the loop will execute once for each character in the input string, we need to update the state to reflect the next character in the string. 

If `a` is a non-empty string, it must have at least one character, and since `i` is the first character, after one iteration, `i` will move to the next character (the second character) in the string. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character left in the string.

Assuming `a` has at least two characters, the next character will be the second character of the input. 

State: **`a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input during loop execution, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '1', `i` is the second character of the input received from raw_input()**
