The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Since `pb` can either be 0 or 1, after execution, `pb` will be either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `pa`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input during loop execution, `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1', `i` is the second character of the input received from raw_input().

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string of '0' and '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input during loop execution, `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1', `i` is the second character of the input received from raw_input()**.
