According to the code, the loop depends on the input from `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute, `raw_input()` must produce at least one character (which could be '0' or '1'). The variable `i` will take the first character from the input string. Given that `a` and `b` are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1', we need to ensure that the input to the loop is also a valid non-empty string.

Since `pa` is 0, it does not directly impact the loop's execution, but it is part of the overall state. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `raw_input()` returns a non-empty string. Thus, `i` would be the first character from this input, which could either be '0' or '1'.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is the first character from raw_input(), which is not empty**.
