Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1', counts the number of '1's in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly define how it receives its inputs, as it calls `raw_input()` twice to read the two strings instead of accepting them as parameters. **
