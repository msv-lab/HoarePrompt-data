The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character of `i` (which is the first character from `raw_input()`) is '1'. The initial value of `pa` is 0. If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1; if `i` is '0', then `pa` remains 0. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `pa` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `b` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1', `pa` is 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`**
