Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if string `a` can be transformed into string `b` using the specified operations. 

One critical issue is that the program simply counts the number of '1's in both strings and compares them. However, this approach does not take into account the actual sequence of characters in the strings or the operations allowed. 

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
a = "011"
b = "110"
```

Expected output: "YES" (because we can remove the first '0' from `a`, then we can append the parity of '11', which is '0', resulting in '110').

However, the program will calculate:
- `pa` (number of '1's in `a`) = 2
- `pb` (number of '1's in `b`) = 2

Thus, it will output "YES", which is correct in this case. 

Now consider another test case:

Input:
```
a = "000"
b = "01"
```

Expected output: "NO" (we cannot turn `a` into `b` as there are no '1's in `a` to create the '1' in `b`).

The program will calculate:
- `pa` = 0
- `pb` = 1

It will output "NO", which is correct.

However, the program fails on this edge case:

Input:
```
a = "011"
b = "111"
```

Expected output: "YES" (we can remove the first '0' from `a` to get '11', which can be transformed into '111' by adding the parity '1' of `11`).

But the program will calculate:
- `pa` = 2
- `pb` = 3

It will output "NO", which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
