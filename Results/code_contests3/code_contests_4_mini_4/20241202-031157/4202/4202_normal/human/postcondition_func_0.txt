The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, each consisting of characters '0' and '1', with lengths between 1 and 1000. It counts the number of '1's in each string and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `a` is greater than or equal to the count in `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not explicitly accept parameters; instead, it reads input directly via `raw_input()`, which may not align with the initial description of accepting two parameters.
