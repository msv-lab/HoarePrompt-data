The loop iterates over each character in the input string. It updates `pb` by adding 1 for each '1' encountered in the input string, while `pa` remains constant as it holds the total count of '1's in the input string. After the loop executes, `pb` will equal the total count of '1's in the input string, which is the same as `pa`. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `pa` and `pb` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is equal to `pa`, and `a` and `b` are the original input strings.**
