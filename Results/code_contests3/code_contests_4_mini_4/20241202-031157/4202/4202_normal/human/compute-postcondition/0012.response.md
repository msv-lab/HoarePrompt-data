The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The initial value of `pb` is 1, and `i` is the second character of the input string. Depending on the value of `i`, the new value of `pb` will either be 1 or 2. The value of `pa` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1'; `i` is the second character of the input string. 

Output State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1'; `i` is the second character of the input string.**
