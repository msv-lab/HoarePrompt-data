The variable `pb` is assigned the value `0`, but this does not affect the values of `pa`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string; `a` is a string of '0's and '1's; `b` is a string of '0's and '1's; `pb` is 0.

Output State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string; `a` is a string of '0's and '1's; `b` is a string of '0's and '1's; `pb` is 0**
