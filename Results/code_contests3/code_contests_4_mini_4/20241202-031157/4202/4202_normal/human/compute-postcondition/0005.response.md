According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters of the input string provided by `raw_input()`. The variable `i` represents the current character from the input string, which means that on the next iteration, `i` will take the next character from the input. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the new input string. 

The state of `pa` can be 1 or 2, or it can remain 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, but this is contingent upon the character that will be processed in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, there must be more characters in the input string beyond the first character.

Thus, we need to ensure that:
- `i` moves to the next character in the input string.
- `pa` is adjusted based on the new character that will be assigned to `i`.

If `i` is currently the first character, then it will become the second character on the next iteration. If `a` and `b` are still strings of '0's and '1's, we can retain them as they are unless specified otherwise.

State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is determined by the next character of the input string, `i` is the second character of the new input string.**
