According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the input string `raw_input()`. The loop will execute again for the next character in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of the input string, and `pa` counts the total number of '1's in the string, while `pb` indicates whether `i` is '1' (1) or not (2).

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to move to the third character of the input string. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the third character, and the value of `pa` remains the same since it is a total count, while `pb` will need to be updated based on whether the new value of `i` (the third character) is '1' or not.

State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is the third character of the input string is '1', `i` is the third character of the input string.**
