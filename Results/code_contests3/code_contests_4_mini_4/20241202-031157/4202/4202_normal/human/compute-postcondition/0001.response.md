According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by `raw_input()`. The loop will iterate over the characters of the string returned by `raw_input()`, which means that at least one character must be present for the loop to execute. Since `pa` is initialized to 0, it does not influence the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that the input string from `raw_input()` is not empty. Therefore, we can state that `i` will be the first character of the input string.

State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `raw_input()` returns a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of that string**
