The code uses the values of `pa` and `pb` to determine whether to print 'NO' or 'YES'. Since `pb` is equal to `pa`, the condition `pa >= pb` always evaluates to `True`. Therefore, the value at index 1 in the list `['NO', 'YES']` will be selected, which corresponds to 'YES'. The variables `pa`, `pb`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pa` is the total count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is equal to `pa`, `a` and `b` are the original input strings; output is 'YES'.**
