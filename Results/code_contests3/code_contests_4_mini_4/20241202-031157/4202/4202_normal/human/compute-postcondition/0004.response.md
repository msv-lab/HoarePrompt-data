`pa` is incremented by 1 if the first character of the new input string (`i`) is '1'. Given that `pa` can be 0 or 1 depending on the first character of the new input string, the possible outcomes are: if `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1 or 2; if `i` is '0', then `pa` remains the same (0 or 1). Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 1 or 2 or remains 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, `i` is the first character of the new input string.

Output State: **`a` is a string of '0's and '1's, `b` is a string of '0's and '1's, `pa` is either 1 or 2 or remains 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, `i` is the first character of the new input string.**
