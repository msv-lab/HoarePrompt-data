The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Since `i` is the third character of the input string, we need to check its value. The variable `pa` can be 0, 1, or 2 depending on its previous state. If `i` is '1', then `pa` is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes `pa + 1`.
- If `i` is '0', then `pa` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state is: `a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the value of `i`, and `i` is the third character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is either `pa` or `pa + 1` depending on whether `i` is '0' or '1', and `i` is the third character of the input string.**
