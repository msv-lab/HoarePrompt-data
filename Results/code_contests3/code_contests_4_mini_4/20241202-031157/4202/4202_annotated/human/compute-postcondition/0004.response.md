The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the second character `i` of the input string is '1'. The previous value of `pa` can be either 0 or 1, depending on its initial state. If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1 or 2; if `i` is '0', then `pa` remains the same. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 1 or 2 (if `i` is '1') or remains 0 (if `i` is '0'), and `i` is the second character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on `i`, and `i` is the second character of the input string.**
