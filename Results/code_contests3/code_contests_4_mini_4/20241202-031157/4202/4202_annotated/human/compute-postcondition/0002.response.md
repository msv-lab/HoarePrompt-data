The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. Given that `i` is the first character of the input string (which is composed of "0" and "1"), `pa` will either remain the same (if `i` is '0') or increase by 1 (if `i` is '1'). The previous value of `pa` is 0. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pa` will be 1; if `i` is '0', `pa` will remain 0. 

Output State: **`a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string**.
