To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the variables:

1. The variable `pb` is either incremented by 1 if `i` is '1' or remains the same if `i` is not '1'.
2. The value of `i` is crucial to determining how `pb` will change. Since `i` is described as the next character in the input string, we need to consider its value.
3. The variable `pa` represents the count of '1's in the input string, but it is not affected by this specific operation.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `pa` are not directly relevant for the operation of incrementing `pb`, we focus on the condition involving `i`.

Given that `pb` can either increase by 1 or stay the same based on the value of `i`, we can summarize the possible scenarios for `pb` as follows:

- If `i` is '1', then `pb` is incremented by 1.
- If `i` is not '1' (i.e., it could be '0'), then `pb` remains unchanged.

Since we don't have specific values for `i` or `pb`, we will state the output in terms of possible values.

Output State: **`pb` is either incremented by 1 if `i` is '1' or remains the same if `i` is not '1'**
