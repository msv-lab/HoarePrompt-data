According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by `raw_input()`. The loop reads characters from the input string until the end of the input is reached. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of the input string, and `pb` is incremented by 1 if that character is '1'. 

Since the loop will execute again for each character in the input string, the next state must reflect that `i` will be updated to the next character in the input. If there are no more characters left, the loop will not execute again.

Assuming the input string has at least one more character left after the last character processed, the next character will be the next character in the sequence of the input string. 

State: **`a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character in the input string, `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.**
