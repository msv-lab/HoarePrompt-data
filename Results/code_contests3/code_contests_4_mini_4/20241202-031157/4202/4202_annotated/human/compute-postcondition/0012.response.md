The expression `pb += i == '1'` checks if the variable `i` is equal to the string '1'. If `i` is '1', the comparison evaluates to `True`, which is equivalent to 1 in Python, and `pb` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not '1', the comparison evaluates to `False`, which is equivalent to 0, and `pb` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `i` or `pb`, we can only conclude that `pb` can either increment or remain the same based on the value of `i`. Therefore, we will represent the possible outcomes.

Output State: **`a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the next character in the input string, and `pb` is either incremented by 1 if `i` is '1' or remains the same if `i` is not '1'.**
