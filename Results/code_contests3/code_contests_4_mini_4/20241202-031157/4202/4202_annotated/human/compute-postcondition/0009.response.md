According to the code, the loop executes based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The loop will iterate over each character in the input string. The variables `a` and `b` are strings composed of "0" and "1", and `pa` represents the count of '1's in the input string. The variable `pb` is initialized to 0.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `raw_input()` provides at least one character. The variable `i` will get the last character of the input string after the loop starts, but before the loop starts, we must ensure that we have `i` initialized to the last character of the input string once the input is provided.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the input string must not be empty, `pa` must be the count of '1's in the provided input string, and `i` should be the last character of this input string after it has been read.

State: **`a` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `b` is a string composed of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, for the loop to execute the first time `raw_input()` must provide a non-empty string, `i` will be the last character of that string**
