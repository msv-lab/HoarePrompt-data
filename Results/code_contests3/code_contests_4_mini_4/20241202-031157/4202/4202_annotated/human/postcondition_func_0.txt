The function reads two strings composed of the characters "0" and "1" from user input, counts the number of '1's in each string, and then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It does not accept parameters, and the return value is not specified, as it prints output directly.
