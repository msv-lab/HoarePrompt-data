#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t test cases, where each test case consists of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9' without any whitespaces.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains `T * 9` transformed strings (each string formed by replacing every '9' in the corresponding input strings with '1'), `row` is the last input string processed, `nRow` is the last string with '9's replaced by '1', `T` is the input integer, and `t` is equal to `T`.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes 9 lines of input, where each line contains 9 digits from '1' to '9'. It replaces every occurrence of '9' with '1' in each line and collects the modified lines into a list. Finally, it prints the resulting lines as output. The function does not handle any potential edge cases related to invalid input or format since it assumes the input will always be correct as per the given specifications.
