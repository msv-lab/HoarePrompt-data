The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes 9 lines of input, where each line contains 9 digits from '1' to '9'. It replaces every occurrence of '9' with '1' in each line and collects the modified lines into a list. Finally, it prints the resulting lines as output. The function does not handle any potential edge cases related to invalid input or format since it assumes the input will always be correct as per the given specifications.
