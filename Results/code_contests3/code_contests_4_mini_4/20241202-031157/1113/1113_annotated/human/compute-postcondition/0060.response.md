The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its current value. Since `nRow` is initially a string (as indicated by the context of the operation), it will now represent the original string value followed by '1'. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 1`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', and `nRow` is the original string value concatenated with '1'.
