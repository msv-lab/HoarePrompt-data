According to the code, the for loop will iterate a total of 9 times, as specified by `range(9)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to execute one more time. 

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 9 after the next increment. 

As per the loop's structure, it can only execute as long as `i` is less than 9. Therefore, we conclude that `i` must be increased to 9 for the loop to be able to execute one more time.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is the transformed string, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be 9.**
