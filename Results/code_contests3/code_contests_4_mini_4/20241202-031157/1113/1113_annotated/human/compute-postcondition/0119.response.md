The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is a string. Since `nRow` was not specified in the initial state but is likely to be a string (or empty), it will now become '1' if it was empty or will append '1' to its current value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`, assuming it starts as an empty string.

Output State: **`nRow` is now '1' (or 'nRow' concatenated with '1' if it was non-empty), `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after the current character.**
