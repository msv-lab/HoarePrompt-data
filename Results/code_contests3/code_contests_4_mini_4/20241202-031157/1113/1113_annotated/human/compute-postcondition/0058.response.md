Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is increased by '1', and `i` will be the next character in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it.***
