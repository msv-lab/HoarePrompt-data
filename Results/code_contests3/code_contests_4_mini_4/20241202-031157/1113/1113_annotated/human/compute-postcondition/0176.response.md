Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to contain the previous value concatenated with '1', otherwise `nRow` is updated to include the next character in `row`.***
