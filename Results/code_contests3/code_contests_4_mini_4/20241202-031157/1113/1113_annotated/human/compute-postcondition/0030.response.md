According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must be a non-empty string. Given that `i` is initialized to 9, this value will not affect the execution of the loop since `i` is redefined by the loop variable. Therefore, at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `row` is a non-empty string. 

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is an empty string**
