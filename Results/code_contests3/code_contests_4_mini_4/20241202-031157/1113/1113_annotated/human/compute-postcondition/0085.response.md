The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `res` is a list containing 9 strings and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. After execution, `res` will contain one additional string, which is the value of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings plus `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'**.
