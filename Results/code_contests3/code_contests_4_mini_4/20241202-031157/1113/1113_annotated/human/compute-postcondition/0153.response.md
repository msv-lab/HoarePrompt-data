Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters and whitespace stripped, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and `i` is the first character in `row` (index 0). If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the first character of `row`.***
