The variable `nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string (`''`), concatenating it with `'1'` results in `nRow` becoming `'1'`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is '9'.
