According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that `nRow` has been updated to '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the next character in the string `row`. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string, it must have at least one more character after '9' for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to consider the next character in `row` after the current character '9'.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more character after '9' and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
