Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `i` is 9. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the string value of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
