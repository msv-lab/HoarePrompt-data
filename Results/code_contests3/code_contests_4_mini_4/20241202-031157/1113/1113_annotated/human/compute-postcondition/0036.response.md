According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters after the current index, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', and `row` is a non-empty string. The loop iterates over each character in `row`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character from `row`. 

If `row` has at least one more character after '9', `i` will be assigned that next character, and the loop will continue executing.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9'**
