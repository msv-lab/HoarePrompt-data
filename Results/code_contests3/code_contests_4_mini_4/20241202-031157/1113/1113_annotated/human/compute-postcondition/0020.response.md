Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the second character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is now the concatenation of its previous value and '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
