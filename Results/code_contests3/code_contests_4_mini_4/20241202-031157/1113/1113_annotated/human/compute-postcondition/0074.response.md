`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The initial value of `nRow` is an empty string (`''`), and `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be `'1'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 1, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
