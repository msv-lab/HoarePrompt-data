The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `row` based on the user input while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a user input string, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.**
