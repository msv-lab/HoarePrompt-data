The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect the other variables, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9**.
