According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9' if the loop has executed for all characters in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated based on the logic defined in the else part, which means the next character in `row` must be processed for the loop to execute again.

In this case, since `i` is equal to '9', the loop would have completed iterating over that character, and the next character would be processed. If `row` contains more characters after '9', the next character will dictate the value of `i` in the next iteration. Assuming that `row` is a non-empty string, we need to determine the current state of `i` and prepare for the next character in `row`.

Assuming `row` has at least one more character after '9', `i` will be updated to that next character and `nRow` will be adjusted accordingly based on the loop logic.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `i` will be the next character in `row` after '9'.**
