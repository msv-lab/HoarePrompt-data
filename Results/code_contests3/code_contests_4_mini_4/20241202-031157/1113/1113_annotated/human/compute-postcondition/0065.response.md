After analyzing the loop and its behavior through the iterations, I can determine the following output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

The loop iterates exactly 9 times, processing each input string `row` and transforming it into `nRow` by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1'. Each transformed string `nRow` is then appended to the list `res`. 

Therefore, after all 9 iterations, `res` will contain 9 entries, each corresponding to the transformed version of the input strings. The variables `write` and `maxint` remain unchanged throughout the execution, while `row` will hold the last input string processed and `nRow` will hold the last transformed string.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings formed by replacing every '9' in the corresponding input strings with '1', `row` is the last input string processed, and `nRow` is the last string with '9's replaced by '1's.**
