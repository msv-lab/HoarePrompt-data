The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`, which already contains 9 transformed strings. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is the transformed string, `T` is greater than 1, and `t` is equal to `T`.
