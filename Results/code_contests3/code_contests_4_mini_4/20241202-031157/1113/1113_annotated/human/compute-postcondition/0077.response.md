`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, and since `nRow` is initially '1', after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '11'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '11'**.
