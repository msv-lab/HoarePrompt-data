Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated based on the logic defined in the else part. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to the string concatenation of its previous value and the value of `i`, and `i` remains unchanged.***
