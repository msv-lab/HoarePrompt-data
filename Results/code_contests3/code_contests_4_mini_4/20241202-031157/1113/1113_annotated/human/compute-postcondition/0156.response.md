`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The variable `i` is the second character in `row`, which is a string. Since `row` contains at least 10 characters, `i` is a valid character. However, the exact value of `nRow` before this operation is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i` to its previous value, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by adding the character `i` to its previous value; `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is the second character in `row`.**
