The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string (`''`). The previous state of `nRow` was that it contained the same characters as `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'. However, after this assignment, `nRow` is now an empty string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9.
