The value of `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after the current character, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.
