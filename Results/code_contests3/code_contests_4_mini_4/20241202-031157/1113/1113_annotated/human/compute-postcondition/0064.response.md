The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` is a list that already contains `nRow`, which is formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged. After executing the code, the list `res` will now contain an additional entry of `nRow`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains an additional entry of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged.**
