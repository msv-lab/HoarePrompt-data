According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`, which is the input string processed. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. The variable `i` is already set to 1, but since it will be reassigned in the loop, it doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to start. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `row` should be a non-empty string. The initial state of `i` is not relevant here since the loop will update `i` with the first character of `row`.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
