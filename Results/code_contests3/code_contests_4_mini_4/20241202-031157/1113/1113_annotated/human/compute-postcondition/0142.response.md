Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input with at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is increased by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
