The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending the string '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value. However, it is clear that `nRow` now contains its previous value followed by the character '1'. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` will be the next character in `row` after '9', and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` will be the next character in `row` after '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**.
