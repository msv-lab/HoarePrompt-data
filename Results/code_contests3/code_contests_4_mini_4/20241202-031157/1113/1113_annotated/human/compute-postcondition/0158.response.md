According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character in `row`. Since `row` has at least 10 characters, there are still characters left for the loop to process. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string `row` must be considered. Given that `i` is currently the second character, the next character will be the third character in `row`. Hence, the index of `i` will increase by 1.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters and whitespace stripped, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and `i` is the third character in `row`.**
