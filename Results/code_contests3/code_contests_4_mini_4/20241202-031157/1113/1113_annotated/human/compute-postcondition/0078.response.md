The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', and since `i` is not '9', it will take on the next character from `row`. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `nRow`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1' concatenated with the next character in `row`**.
