Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters and whitespace stripped, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and `i` is the third character in `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.***
