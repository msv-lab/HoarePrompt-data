The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will now contain its previous value concatenated with `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is now `nRow + i`, `i` is not equal to '9', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is now `nRow + i`, `i` is not equal to '9', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`.**
