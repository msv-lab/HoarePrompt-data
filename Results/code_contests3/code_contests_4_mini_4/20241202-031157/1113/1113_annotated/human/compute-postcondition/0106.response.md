The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will now contain the input string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed. The previous state of `row` is a non-empty string, but since the exact value is not specified, it is replaced by the input value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings (10 original strings plus `nRow`), `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in the original `row` with '1', `i` is 9 and the loop does not execute again.
