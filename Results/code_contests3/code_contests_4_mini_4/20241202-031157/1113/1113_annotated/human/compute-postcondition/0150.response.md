The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending the string '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string '', so after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters and whitespace stripped, `nRow` is '1', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is the first character in `row` (index 0), and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters and whitespace stripped, `nRow` is '1', `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is the first character in `row` (index 0), and `i` is equal to '9'**
