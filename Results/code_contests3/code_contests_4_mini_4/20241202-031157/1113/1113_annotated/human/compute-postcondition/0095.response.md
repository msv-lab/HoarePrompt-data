According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, which means it corresponds to the ninth character of the string `row`. Since the loop iterates for each character in `row`, the loop will execute again if `row` has more characters. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in the string `row`. If `row` contains at least 10 characters, `i` would be assigned the next character in the string, and if `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` would be updated to the string value of `i`. 

Thus, if `i` is the last character of `row`, the loop would not execute again. However, if `row` has more characters, `i` will be the next character and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is the last character of `row`, then `nRow` is '1' and `i` is the next character in the string; otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the string value of `i` and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
