The variable `maxint` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. The value of `write` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity**
