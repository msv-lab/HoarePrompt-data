The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the value of `i`. The initial value of `nRow` is the first character in `row` concatenated with its previous value. The variable `i` is the next character in `row` following '9'. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be updated to include the next character in `row` after its initial value. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` is updated to include the next character in `row`, `i` is the next character in `row` following '9'**
