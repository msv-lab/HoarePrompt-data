The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. Since `nRow` was previously a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', this assignment clears its value, making it an empty string. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the last character of the last processed `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`.**
