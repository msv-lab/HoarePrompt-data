According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters after the current character `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is '9'. Thus, `nRow` has been updated to '11'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be assigned the next character in `row`.

Since `i` is currently '9' and `row` is non-empty, there must be at least one character left in `row` after '9'. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated based on that character.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is the next character in `row`, then `nRow` is updated accordingly based on that character.**
