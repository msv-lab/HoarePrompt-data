Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the next `i`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
