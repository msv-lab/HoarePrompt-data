The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` has been updated by appending `'1'` to it, but we cannot specify the exact new value.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it.**
