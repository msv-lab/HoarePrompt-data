`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will now contain the value of `i` as a string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i` (a string), and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i` (a string), and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
