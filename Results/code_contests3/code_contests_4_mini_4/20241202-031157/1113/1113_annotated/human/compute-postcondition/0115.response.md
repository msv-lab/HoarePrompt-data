`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, meaning that '1' is concatenated to whatever value `nRow` previously held. Since `nRow` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can only conclude that it will now have an additional character '1' appended to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'`.
