The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the third character of the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` will hold a specific character value from that string. However, the specific character value of `i` and the initial value of `nRow` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `nRow` after the operation. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.**
