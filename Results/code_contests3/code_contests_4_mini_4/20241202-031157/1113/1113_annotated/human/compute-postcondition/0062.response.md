Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 1`, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the original string value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
