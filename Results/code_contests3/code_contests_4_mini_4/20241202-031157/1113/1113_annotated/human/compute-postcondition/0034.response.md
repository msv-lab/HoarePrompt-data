The statement `nRow += i` is attempting to concatenate the value of `i` (which is 9) to `nRow` (which is an empty string). Therefore, `nRow` will now contain the string representation of `i`, which is '9'. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '9', and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
