The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The variable `i` is the third character in the `row`, which is a string with at least 10 characters. Therefore, `nRow` will be incremented by the value of `i` (the character). The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and `i` is the third character in `row`; `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.**
