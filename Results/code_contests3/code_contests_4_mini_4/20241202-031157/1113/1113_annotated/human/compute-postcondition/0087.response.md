The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous state of `row` is a non-empty string, but its specific value will change based on the input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `row` based on the input provided by the user.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9.**
