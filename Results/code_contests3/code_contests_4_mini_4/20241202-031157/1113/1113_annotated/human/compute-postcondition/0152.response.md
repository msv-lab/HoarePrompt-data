The variable `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is the first character in `row`, which has been specified as an input string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` will now contain the first character of `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string (`''`), so after the operation, `nRow` will simply be the first character of `row`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters and whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and `i` is the first character in `row` (index 0), where `i` is not equal to '9'.**
