According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character (i.e., it should not be an empty string). The current value of `i` is 9, but this value will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the first iteration of the loop. Therefore, we need to ensure `row` is not empty to execute the loop.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must contain at least 1 character**
