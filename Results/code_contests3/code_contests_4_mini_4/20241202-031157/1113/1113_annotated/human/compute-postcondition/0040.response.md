According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9', the loop can iterate one more time for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row` after the previous character processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in `row`, and `row` must still have at least one more character after the current `i`.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after the next `i`**
