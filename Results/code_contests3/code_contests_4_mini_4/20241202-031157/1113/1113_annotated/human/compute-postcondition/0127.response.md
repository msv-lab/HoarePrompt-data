The `row` variable is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it will now hold the new input value from the user. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in the previous `row` with '1', `i` is the last character of the last processed `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`.**
