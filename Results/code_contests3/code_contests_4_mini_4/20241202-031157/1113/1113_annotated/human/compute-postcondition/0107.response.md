The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This operation does not affect any of the previously defined variables, so the states of those remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the new assignment of `nRow`.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings (10 original strings plus `nRow`), `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9 and the loop does not execute again.**
