The `nRow` variable, which is currently an empty string, is concatenated with the string '1'. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will now hold the value '1'. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'**.
