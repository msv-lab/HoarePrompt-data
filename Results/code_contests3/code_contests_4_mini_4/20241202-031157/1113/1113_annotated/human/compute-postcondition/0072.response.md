`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', and since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 1, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 1, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
