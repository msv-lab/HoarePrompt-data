The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 11 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `i` is the next character in `row` at index 10, and `nRow` is updated to include the previous value concatenated with '1'.
