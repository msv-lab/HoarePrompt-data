The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which represents the next character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9', `i` will be a valid character. The impact of the execution will affect only `nRow`, and the new value of `nRow` will be a concatenation of its previous value and the character `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9', and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
