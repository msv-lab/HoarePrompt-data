`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is an empty string, the new value of `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'**
