Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '11'. Otherwise, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is updated to '1' concatenated with the next character in `row`.***
