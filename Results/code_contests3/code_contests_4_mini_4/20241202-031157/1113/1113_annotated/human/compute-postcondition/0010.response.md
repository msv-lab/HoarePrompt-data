The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The other variables (`write`, `maxint`, `res`, `i`, `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.**
