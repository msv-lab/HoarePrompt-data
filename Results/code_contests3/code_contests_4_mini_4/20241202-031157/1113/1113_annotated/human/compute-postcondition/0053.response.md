The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is 8, the new value of `nRow` will be '8'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '8', `i` is 8 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '8', `i` is 8 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
