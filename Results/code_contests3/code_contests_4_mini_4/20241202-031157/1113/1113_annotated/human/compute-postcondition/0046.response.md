According to the code, the loop is designed to execute a total of 9 times, with the variable `i` controlling the number of iterations. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute again. Since `i` increments with each iteration, if the loop has executed `i` times already, then for the next iteration `i` will simply increase by 1. 

Given that the loop has not yet reached its maximum of 9 iterations, and assuming it has executed `i` times, we need to determine the appropriate state for the next iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `i` is 8 (the last valid index before reaching the limit of 9), then `i` will be incremented to 9 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9. 

Therefore, the new state should reflect `i` incremented by 1 and indicate that the loop cannot execute again because it has reached the limit of 9 iterations.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a string, `nRow` contains the same characters as `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `i` is 9, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9**
