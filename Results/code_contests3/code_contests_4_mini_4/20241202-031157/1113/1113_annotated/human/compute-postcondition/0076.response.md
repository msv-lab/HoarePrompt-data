According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either '9' or it is not equal to '9' and is set to 1. If `i` is '9', the loop will not execute again since it has reached the last character. 

If `i` is not '9', then it means `row` has more characters to iterate over. Since `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should take the next character in the string `row`. If `i` is currently set to '9', it will remain '9', and we cannot execute the loop again.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must become the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters after the current `i`, then `i` will be the next character in `row`.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not '9', it will be the next character in `row` for the loop to execute one more time.**
