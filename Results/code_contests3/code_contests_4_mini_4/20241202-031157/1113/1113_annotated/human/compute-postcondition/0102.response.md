Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it.***
