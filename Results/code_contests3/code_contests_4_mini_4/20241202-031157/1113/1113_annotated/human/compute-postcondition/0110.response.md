The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its previous value, which is an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 0, and `i` is equal to '9'**
