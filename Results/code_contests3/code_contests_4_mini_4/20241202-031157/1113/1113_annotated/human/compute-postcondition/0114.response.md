According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will iterate over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is equal to '9' or not equal to '9'. 

If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is set to '0'. After the iteration, the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `row`. 

To execute one more time, the next character must be the next character in `row`. If `row` contains more characters, `i` will be set to the next character in the string. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` will be the next character in `row`, which will be the second character if `row` has at least 2 characters.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in the string**
