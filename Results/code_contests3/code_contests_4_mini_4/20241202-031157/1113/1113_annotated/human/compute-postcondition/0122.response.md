Initially, `nRow` is an empty string and `row` is a non-empty string. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. For every character, if it is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`. If the character is not '9', that character is appended to `nRow`.

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `nRow` will consist of the original characters of `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. Consequently, the output state reflects that `nRow` contains these transformed values.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.**
