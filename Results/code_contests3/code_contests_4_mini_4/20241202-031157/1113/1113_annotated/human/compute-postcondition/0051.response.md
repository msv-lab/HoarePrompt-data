The variable `nRow` is a non-empty string, and it is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, the result of the concatenation will be `'1'`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 8, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 8, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
