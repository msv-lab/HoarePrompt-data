Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in the string after the current character. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is now '1' (or 'nRow' concatenated with '1' if it was non-empty). Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
