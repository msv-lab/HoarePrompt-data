Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is either '1' if the first character `i` is '9', or `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i` if `i` is not equal to '9'. The variable `T` remains greater than 1, and `t` is equal to `T`.***
