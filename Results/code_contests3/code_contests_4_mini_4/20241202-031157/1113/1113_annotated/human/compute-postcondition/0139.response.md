According to the code, the loop iterates through each character in the string `row`. The current state indicates that `row` is a non-empty string, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` was '9'. This means that `i` will be updated to the next character in `row` for the next iteration. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. The variable `row` is still non-empty, which means there is at least one more character left to iterate through.
2. Since `i` is currently '9', the next character in `row` will be assigned to `i` in the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after '9'. If we assume that there is at least one more character, the value of `i` will be updated to that next character in `row`.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input with at least one more character, and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
