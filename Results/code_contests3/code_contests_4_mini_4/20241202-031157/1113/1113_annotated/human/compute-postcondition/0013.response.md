The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value, which is an empty string. Therefore, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and the first character of `row` (i) is '9'.**
