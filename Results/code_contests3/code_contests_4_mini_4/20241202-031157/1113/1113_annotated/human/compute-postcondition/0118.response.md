According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next character in `row` after the current one. 

Given that `row` is a non-empty string, and since `i` is the next character, then there exists at least one more character in `row`. Therefore, the state must reflect that `i` will now be the next character in the string after the current character, and `row` will still be the same non-empty string. 

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after the current character.**
