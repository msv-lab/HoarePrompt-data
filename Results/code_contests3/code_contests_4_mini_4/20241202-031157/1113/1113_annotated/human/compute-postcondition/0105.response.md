According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to 8, which means it can execute a total of 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 9. However, since the loop condition is `range(9)`, once `i` reaches 9, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings (10 original strings plus `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9 for the loop to execute one more time `nRow` must be adjusted to allow for a new loop condition, but it cannot since the loop will not execute again.**
