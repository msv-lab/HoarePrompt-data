Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string. If the first character of `row` (i) is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is set to the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
