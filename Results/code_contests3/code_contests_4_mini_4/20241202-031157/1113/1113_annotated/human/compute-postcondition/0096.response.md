The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since the initial state indicates that `nRow` was either '1' or updated based on the value of `i`, we can deduce that regardless of its previous state, it will now have '1' added to it, resulting in `nRow` being updated to whatever its previous value was plus '1'. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated (previously either '1' or derived from `i`), and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
