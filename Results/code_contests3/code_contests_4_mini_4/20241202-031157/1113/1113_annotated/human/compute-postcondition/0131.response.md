The value of `nRow` is concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will become '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the first character of `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and the first character `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the first character of `row`, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and the first character `i` is equal to '9'.**
