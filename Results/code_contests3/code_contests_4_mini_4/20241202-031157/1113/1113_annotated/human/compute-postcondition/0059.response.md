According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row` and the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` is increased by '1', and `i` will take the next character in `row` for the next iteration. Since `row` is a non-empty string, there must be at least one character after '9' in `row` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states accordingly. After the last iteration, `nRow` has been increased by '1', and now `i` will be the next character in `row`.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 1`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'**
