According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i` which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8, which is the last value before the loop terminates. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 9, but since the range function is defined as `range(9)`, it will not execute again because `i` would not be less than 9.

State: **`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9 for the loop to not execute again.**
