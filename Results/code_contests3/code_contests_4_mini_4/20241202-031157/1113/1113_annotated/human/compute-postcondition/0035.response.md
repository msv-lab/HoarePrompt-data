Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '9'.***
