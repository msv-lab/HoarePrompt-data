Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' if `i` is equal to '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` from `row`.***
