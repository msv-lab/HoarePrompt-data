The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. Since `row` is currently a non-empty string from input, its value will now be the result of the input operation with whitespace removed. The other variables (`write`, `maxint`, `res`, `nRow`, `T`, `t`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings (including `nRow`), `row` is the input string with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the transformed string, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, and `i` must be 9 for the loop to execute a tenth time.
