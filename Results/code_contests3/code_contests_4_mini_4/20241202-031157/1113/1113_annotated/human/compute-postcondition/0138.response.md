Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string from input, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`, and `i` will be the next character in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`.***
