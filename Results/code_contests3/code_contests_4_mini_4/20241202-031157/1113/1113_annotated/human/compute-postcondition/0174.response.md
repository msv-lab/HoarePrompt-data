The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its previous value. Since `nRow` is the first character in `row` concatenated with its previous value, after executing `nRow += '1'`, the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value of `nRow` followed by '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string with at least 10 characters, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is equal to `T`, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1', `i` is the next character in `row` following '9'.
