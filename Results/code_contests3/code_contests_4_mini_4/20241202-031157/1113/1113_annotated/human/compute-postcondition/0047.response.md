The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous value of `row` is unknown until the input is provided. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` contains the same characters as `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `i` is 9, and for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9.
