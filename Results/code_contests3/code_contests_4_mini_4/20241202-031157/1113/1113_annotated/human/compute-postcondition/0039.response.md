Postcondition: ***`write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9'. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is increased by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include `i`.***
