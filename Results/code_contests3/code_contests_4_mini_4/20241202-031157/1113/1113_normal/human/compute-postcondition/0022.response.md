The variable `nRow` is being appended with the string '1'. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific new value of `nRow`, but we know that it will now include the character '1' at the end of whatever its previous value was.

Since we do not know the initial value of `nRow`, we just note that it is modified to include '1'. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nRow` is modified to include '1' at the end of its previous value; other variables remain unchanged.**
