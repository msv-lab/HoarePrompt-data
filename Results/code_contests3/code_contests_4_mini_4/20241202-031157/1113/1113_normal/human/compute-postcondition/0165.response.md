The `row` variable is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, where `input` accepts a user input string and `strip` removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged since this line only affects the `row` variable. The loop condition is also not impacted directly by this input operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
