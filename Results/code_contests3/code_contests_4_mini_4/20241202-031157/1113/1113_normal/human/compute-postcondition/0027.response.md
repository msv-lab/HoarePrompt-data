According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 9. Since the loop is defined to run for `i` in the range of 9, once `i` reaches 9, the loop will not execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute a tenth time, the range must be adjusted to allow `i` to be 9. The variable `T` being greater than or equal to 1, `res` being a list with `nRow`, and other variables do not affect the loop's execution since they are not directly controlling the iteration.

State: **`input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string from input, for the loop to execute a tenth time `i` must be 9.**
