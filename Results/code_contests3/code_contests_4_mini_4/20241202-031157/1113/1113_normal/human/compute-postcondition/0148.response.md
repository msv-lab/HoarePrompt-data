According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The `for` loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character (i.e., it cannot be an empty string). 

Given that `nRow` is an empty string and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, we need to ensure that `row` is not empty. The variable `i` is currently set to 9, but this will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the loop execution.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes:
- `row` must contain at least one character.
- `i` will be the first character of `row` during the first iteration.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of row**
