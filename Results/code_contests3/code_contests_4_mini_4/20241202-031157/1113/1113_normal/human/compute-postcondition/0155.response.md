The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but after executing this line, `nRow` will now have '1' appended to its prior value. Other variables remain unaffected, so the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated with '1' appended to its previous value.**
