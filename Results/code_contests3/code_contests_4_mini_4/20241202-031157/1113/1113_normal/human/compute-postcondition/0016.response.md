Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned a non-empty string read from input (not empty). If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `i` is equal to '9'. Otherwise, `nRow` is '0' and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
