The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. However, this assignment does not affect the previous values of the variables since `nRow` is being reset. Other variables (`row`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is the user input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes `nRow`, and the loop cannot execute again as the range ends at 9.

Output State: **`row` is the user input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes `nRow`, and the loop cannot execute again as the range ends at 9.**
