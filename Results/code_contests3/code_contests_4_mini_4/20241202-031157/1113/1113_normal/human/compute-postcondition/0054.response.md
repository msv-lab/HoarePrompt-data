Postcondition: ***`nRow` is '1' and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), and the values of `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `nRow` now includes the value of `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9', while `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged.***
