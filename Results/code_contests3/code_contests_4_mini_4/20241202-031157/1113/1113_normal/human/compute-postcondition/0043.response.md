Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned a value from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1' as a new element. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
