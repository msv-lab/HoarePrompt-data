`res` is a list that will have `nRow` appended to it. The value of `nRow` is the same as `row`, except all occurrences of '9' have been replaced by '1'. The `row` variable remains unchanged, and the state of `res` will now include the modified version of `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', and `res` now includes `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', and `res` now includes `nRow`**.
