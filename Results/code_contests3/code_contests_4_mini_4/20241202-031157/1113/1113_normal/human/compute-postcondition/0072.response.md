`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is currently not defined in the initial state. Since `nRow` is not initialized or provided a value in the initial state, we cannot determine its value or the impact of the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is being concatenated with '1', but its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 9; `nRow` is being concatenated with '1' but its previous value is unknown.**
