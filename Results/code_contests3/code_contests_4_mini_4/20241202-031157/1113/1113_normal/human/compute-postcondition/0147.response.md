In the provided code snippet, `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow`, which was formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', is now overwritten. Other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is now an empty string, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` remains 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is now an empty string, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is 9**
