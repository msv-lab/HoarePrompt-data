The variable `nRow` is being updated by appending the string '1' to its previous value. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we can't determine its previous value. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**.
