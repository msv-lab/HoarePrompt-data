To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the code provided:

The loop processes each character in the string `row`. If the character is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`. If the character is anything else, it appends that character to `nRow`. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `nRow` starts as an empty string.
- `row` is a non-empty string (after processing, it will be transformed into `nRow`).

At the end of the loop:
- For each '9' in `row`, `nRow` gets increased by '1'.
- For each character other than '9', that character is appended to `nRow`.

Since `row` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. The final value of `nRow` will be a transformed version of `row`, where each '9' has been replaced by '1', and all other characters remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing is:

Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is the original non-empty string, and `res` includes an additional entry (the final value of `nRow`).**
