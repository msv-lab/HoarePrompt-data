The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will contain the string '1'. The values of the other variables (`res` and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row` is equal to '9'**.
