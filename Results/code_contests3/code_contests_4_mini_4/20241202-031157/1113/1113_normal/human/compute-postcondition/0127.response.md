The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Since `row` takes an input value, its specific content is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 1, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 1, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
