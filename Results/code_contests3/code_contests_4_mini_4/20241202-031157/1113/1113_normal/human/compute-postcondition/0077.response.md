`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is already defined, and it is concatenated with '1'. The variables `row` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after '9', and `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1' resulting in a new value for `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after '9', `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1'**
