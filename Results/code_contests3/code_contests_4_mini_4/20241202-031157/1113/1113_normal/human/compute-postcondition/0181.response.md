The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For each character, if it is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`. If it is any other character, it appends that character to `nRow`. After all iterations, `nRow` will be constructed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged.

If `row` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. If `row` contains no '9's, `nRow` will simply be equal to `row`. If `row` has one or more '9's, each '9' will be replaced by '1' in `nRow`.

Given that `res` remains unchanged, and `row` is still a non-empty string, the final value of `nRow` will be the modified string derived from `row`. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.**
