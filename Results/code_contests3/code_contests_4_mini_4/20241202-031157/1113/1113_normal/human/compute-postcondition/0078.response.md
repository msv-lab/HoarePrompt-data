The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `nRow` with the value of `i`. The variable `i` holds the next character in the string after '9', but the specific character is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value concatenated with this unknown character `i`. The value of `row` remains unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after '9', `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after '9', `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with `i`**
