The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous value of `res` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `res` will contain one element, which is the value of `nRow`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, and `row` is a non-empty string from input.
