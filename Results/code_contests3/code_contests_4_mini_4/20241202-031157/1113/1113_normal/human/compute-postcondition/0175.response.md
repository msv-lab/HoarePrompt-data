The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the second character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` has a specific value. The impact of the code is that `nRow` will be updated based on its previous value plus the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include `i`**.
