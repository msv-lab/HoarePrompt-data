The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string '1', which means the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value followed by '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is equal to '9'; `nRow` is updated to the previous value concatenated with '1'.**
