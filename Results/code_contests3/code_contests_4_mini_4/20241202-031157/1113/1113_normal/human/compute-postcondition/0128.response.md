The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the variables `res`, `i`, and `row` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `res`, `i`, and `row`, alongside the new value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` is 1, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string.**
