`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since the previous value of `i` is unknown, we cannot specify the exact change in `nRow`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is increased by `i`**
