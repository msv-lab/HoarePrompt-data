The code snippet `nRow += '1'` is used to append the string '1' to the end of the variable `nRow`. However, the initial state does not mention the variable `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value or state. 

Since `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`, but `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot conclude how `nRow` was affected.

Thus, the Output State is: `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, and the variable `nRow` is updated by appending '1', but we cannot determine its previous value or state.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' but is not defined in the initial state.**
