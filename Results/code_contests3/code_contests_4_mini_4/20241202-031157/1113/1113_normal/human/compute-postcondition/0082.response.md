`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with `i`. 

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with `i`**
