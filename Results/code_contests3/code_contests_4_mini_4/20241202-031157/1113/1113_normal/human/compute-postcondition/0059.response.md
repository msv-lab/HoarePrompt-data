According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `row`. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, which indicates that we have already processed 10 entries in `row`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 11. The variable `nRow` remains '11', and `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`).

The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `row`. For the loop to execute a total of 12 times, the length of `row` must be at least 12.

State: **`nRow` is '11', `i` is 11, for the loop to execute a twelfth time `row` must include at least 12 entries.**
