According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string and the first character `i` is not equal to '9', the loop will continue executing for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the current character being processed in the loop.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be adjusted to point to the next character in `row`. Therefore, if the length of `row` is greater than the current index of `i`, the loop will execute again. 

Assuming that `row` has more characters beyond the current character `i`, we can determine the next character `i` will iterate over. If `i` is currently at the last character of `row`, then the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented to the next character in `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must point to the next character in `row`.**
