According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute again for the next character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that `nRow` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` would have been increased by the value of `i`. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string, if the loop executes again, `i` will take the next character in `row`. If `row` has 10 characters (as `res` has 10 strings), then for the loop to execute once more, we need to ensure that `i` is the next character after the 9th character, which will be the 10th character in `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings and `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `i` will be the 10th character in `row` and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.**
