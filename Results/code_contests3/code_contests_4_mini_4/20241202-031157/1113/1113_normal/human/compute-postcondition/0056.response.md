`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '11', `i` is '10', `res` includes an additional entry (the value of '11'), while `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is '11', `i` is '10', `res` includes an additional entry (the value of '11'), while `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged.**
