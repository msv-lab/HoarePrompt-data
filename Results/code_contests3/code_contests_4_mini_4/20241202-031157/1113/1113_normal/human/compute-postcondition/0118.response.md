According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` is non-empty, the loop can execute for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a character from `row`, which can either be '9' or not '9'. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '11'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is updated to '01'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to its current value. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character left. Therefore, if `row` had `k` characters at the start, after the last iteration, it has `k-1` characters left. 

If `i` is the last character in `row`, for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least `k` characters originally, and now it will have `k-1` characters left to process the next character.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least one more character left to process.**
