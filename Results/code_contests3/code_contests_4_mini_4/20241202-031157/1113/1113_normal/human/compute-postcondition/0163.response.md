The `append` method is called on the list `res`, which adds the value of `nRow` to the end of the list. The previous value of `res` is a list containing 10 strings, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list `res` containing the new string `nRow`. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings followed by `nRow`, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
