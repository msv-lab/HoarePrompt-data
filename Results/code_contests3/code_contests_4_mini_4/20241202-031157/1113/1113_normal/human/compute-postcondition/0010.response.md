The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This does not affect any of the other variables since they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `row` is assigned the value of the input read and stripped of whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.
