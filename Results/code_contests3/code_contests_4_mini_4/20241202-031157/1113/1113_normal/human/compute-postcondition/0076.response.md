According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute again for each character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9', which means that `nRow` would have been concatenated with '1' during that iteration. The next iteration will use the next character in `row`.

Since `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is now '9', for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character in the string. If `row` has more characters, `i` will be the next character in `row` after '9', and `nRow` will have its updated value from the previous iteration.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in the string after '9', `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1'**
