According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`. If `row` has at least 3 characters, then `i` will be the third character in the string. 

Thus, the state should reflect that `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, and for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`input` is assigned a value from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`.**
