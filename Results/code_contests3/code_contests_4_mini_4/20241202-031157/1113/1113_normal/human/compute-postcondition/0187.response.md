Functionality: ** The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and processes each test case consisting of 9 lines of Sudoku rows. It replaces each occurrence of '9' in the input rows with '1' and outputs the modified rows. The function does not validate the Sudoku solution but merely transforms the input according to the specified rule. **
