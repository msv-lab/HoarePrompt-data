`nRow` is assigned the value of `row` with every '9' replaced by '1', and now `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` is a list containing 10 strings, and since we are appending `nRow`, the length of `res` will increase by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings and now contains `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings and now contains `nRow`; `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'**.
