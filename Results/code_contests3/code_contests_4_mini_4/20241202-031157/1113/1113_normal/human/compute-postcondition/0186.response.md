The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. It processes input consisting of an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of 9 lines, with each line containing 9 characters that represent a valid Sudoku solution, using characters ranging from '1' to '9'.

The function evaluates the validity of the Sudoku solutions provided. Based on the evaluation, it returns a result for each test case indicating whether the Sudoku solution is valid or not.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases of Sudoku solutions and returns whether each solution is valid or not.**
