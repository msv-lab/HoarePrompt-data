According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 0 and can go up to 8 (inclusive) since the range is `range(9)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it 9. However, since the range only goes up to 8, the loop cannot execute again because the condition of `i < 9` will no longer be satisfied. 

To summarize, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9, which is not the case here.

State: **`input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9 which is not possible since `i` is 8.**
