Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is modified to include '1' at the end of its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by 2.***
