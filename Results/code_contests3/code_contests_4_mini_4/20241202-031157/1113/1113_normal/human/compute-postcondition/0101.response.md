`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the third character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` has a specific value (the third character of `row`). The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will increase by the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.**
