According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `row`. If the loop iterates over `row`, it will continue executing as long as there are characters left in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`. Since `i` was the second character previously, `i` will now be the third character in the string. Additionally, since `row` has at least 2 characters, it must have at least 3 characters for the loop to be executed one more time.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`.**
