To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to consider the following points based on the given initial state and the loop code:

1. **Initial State**: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 9 and does not allow the loop to execute again. 

2. **Loop Code**: The loop iterates over each character in `row`. For each character:
   - If the character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`.
   - If the character is not '9', the character itself is appended to `nRow`.

Given that `i` is initialized as 9 and does not allow the loop to execute again, it indicates that there are no iterations of the loop that will occur. 

3. **Output State After All Iterations**:
- Since the loop does not execute, `nRow` will remain in its initial state, which is an empty string. 
- The values of `row` and `res` remain unchanged as per the provided initial state.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` remains unchanged.**
