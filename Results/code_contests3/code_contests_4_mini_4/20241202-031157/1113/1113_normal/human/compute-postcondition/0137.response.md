`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. Since `row` must have at least one more character for the loop to execute one more time, `i` holds a valid character. The other variables, including `res`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` has at least one more character, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated accordingly.**
