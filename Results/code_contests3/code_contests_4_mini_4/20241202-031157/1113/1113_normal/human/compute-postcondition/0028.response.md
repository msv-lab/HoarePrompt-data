`row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which reads a line from the standard input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. Since `row` is a non-empty string from input, it will hold that input value after stripping. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is the input string after stripping, and `i` remains 9 for the loop to execute a tenth time.
