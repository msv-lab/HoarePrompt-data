The code assigns the value of `i` to `nRow`, and since `i` is 0, `nRow` will be incremented by 0. The variable `row` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` must be a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`row` must be a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged**
