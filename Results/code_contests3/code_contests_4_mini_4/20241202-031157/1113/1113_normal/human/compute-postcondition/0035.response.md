Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to the previous value concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the numeric value of `i`.***
