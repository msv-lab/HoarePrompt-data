The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will now hold a new input string after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `nRow` and `res` are not directly impacted, but since `i` is currently 9, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string and now holds the input value; `nRow` remains unchanged; `res` remains unchanged; `i` remains 9 and does not allow the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string and now holds the input value; `nRow` remains unchanged; `res` remains unchanged; `i` remains 9 and does not allow the loop to execute again.**
