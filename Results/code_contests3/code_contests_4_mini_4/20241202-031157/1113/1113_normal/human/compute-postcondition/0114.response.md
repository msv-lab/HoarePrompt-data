According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `row` string. The loop will iterate over each character in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the last character it processed. 

If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '0'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters, we need to consider the next character for `i`. Therefore, the updated states will reflect the next character in the `row` and the corresponding value of `nRow` based on whether that character is '9' or not.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be '1' if that character is '9' or '0' if that character is not '9'**
