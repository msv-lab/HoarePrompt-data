According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the last iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`. Since `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` being a non-empty string suggests that it contains at least one character.

If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. If `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the integer value of `i`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character. 

Assuming that `row` has more than one character, let's denote that the current character processed by the loop is the last character. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` would take the next character from `row`, and `nRow` would be updated accordingly.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least one more character, and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
