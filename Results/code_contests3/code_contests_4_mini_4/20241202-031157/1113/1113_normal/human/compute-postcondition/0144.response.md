`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` is a list containing 9 strings, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. After the execution, `res` will have one additional string, `nRow`, added to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings (the original 9 plus `nRow`), `nRow` is the string formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
