In the initial state, `nRow` is '1' and `i` is '10'. The operation `nRow += i` will attempt to add `i` (which is an integer) to `nRow` (which is a string). This will lead to a type error in Python, as you cannot directly add a string and an integer. 

However, if we consider the scenario where `nRow` should be treated as an integer, we first convert `nRow` to an integer which results in `1` and then add `10`, resulting in `11`. 

Assuming the context allows for this conversion, after the operation, `nRow` would be updated to `11`.

The other variables (`input`, `write`, and `maxint`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is 11, `i` is 10, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), and `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is 11, `i` is 10, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `input` is unchanged, `write` is unchanged, `maxint` is unchanged.**
