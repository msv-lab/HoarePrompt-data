The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This changes the previous value of `nRow`, which was formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged. Therefore, `nRow` now does not hold any value related to `row` anymore and is simply an empty string.

The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is the stripped input string, and `nRow` is now an empty string.
