To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop and the changes it makes to the variable `nRow` based on the contents of `row`.

The loop processes each character in `row`:
- If the character `i` is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- If the character `i` is not '9', it appends the character itself to `nRow`.

Given that:
- `row` is a non-empty string and can contain any characters.
- The loop will process each character in `row` exactly once.

After all iterations, `nRow` will consist of:
- All characters from `row` that are not '9', and
- For each '9' found in `row`, it will append '1' to `nRow` instead of '9'.

The output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will be:
- `input` remains assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input.
- `write` is still assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`.
- `maxint` is still assigned the value of positive infinity.
- `res` contains the final value of `nRow` in a list.
- `T` is still greater than or equal to 1.
- `row` remains a non-empty string.
- `nRow` is the resultant string after processing all characters in `row`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged.**
