The code `nRow += i` attempts to concatenate the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the `nRow` string. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will become the string representation of `i`, which is '0'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned a non-empty string read from input (not empty), `nRow` is '0', and `i` is not equal to '9'.
