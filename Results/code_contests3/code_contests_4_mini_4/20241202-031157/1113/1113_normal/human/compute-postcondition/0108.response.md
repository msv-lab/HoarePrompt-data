According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. The variable `i` starts at 9, which implies that it will not allow the loop to execute again if it is already at the last character of the string (assuming `row` has more than 9 characters). 

To ensure that the loop executes for the first time, `i` should be adjusted to 0 (the starting index of the string), and `nRow` should be considered as the loop processes `row` in its entirety. 

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
