Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `nRow` is now an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must be a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
