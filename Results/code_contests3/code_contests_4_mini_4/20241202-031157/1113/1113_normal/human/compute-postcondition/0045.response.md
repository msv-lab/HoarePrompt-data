The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous state indicates that `res` already contains the value of `nRow`, and since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state reflects the updated contents of `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` now includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged.
