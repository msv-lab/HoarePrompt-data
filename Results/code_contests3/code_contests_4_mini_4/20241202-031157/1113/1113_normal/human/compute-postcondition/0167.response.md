According to the code, the loop iterates over the `row` string. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. The current state shows that `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, but it does not specify whether it contains any characters. Additionally, `i` is set to 9, which is not relevant to the loop execution since `i` will be reassigned with each character in the `row` during the loop.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `row` must not be an empty string. If `row` contains characters, `i` will take on the value of the first character in `row` during the first iteration.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `i` is the first character of `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must be a non-empty string**
