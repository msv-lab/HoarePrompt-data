The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous values indicate that `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', and `res` includes `nRow` before this operation. After execution, `res` will contain one additional element, which is `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `res` now includes an additional `nRow`.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `res` now includes an additional `nRow`.**
