According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that `nRow` has been updated by concatenating the previous value with '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character in the string `row`.

If `row` has more characters, the next value of `i` will be the next character in `row`, and if `i` is not '9', `nRow` will be concatenated with that character. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in `row`.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with `i` (which is not '9' if there are more characters left after '9')**
