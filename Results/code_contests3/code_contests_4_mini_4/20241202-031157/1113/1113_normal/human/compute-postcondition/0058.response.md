Postcondition: ***`nRow` is '11', `i` is '10', and `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`). If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11' and `res` includes an additional entry (the value of '11'). Otherwise, `nRow` remains '11', `i` is '10', and `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`). The values of `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged.***
