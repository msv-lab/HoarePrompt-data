The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will be equal to '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `row` is assigned a non-empty string read from input (not empty), `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'.
