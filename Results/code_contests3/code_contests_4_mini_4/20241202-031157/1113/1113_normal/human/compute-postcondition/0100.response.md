The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string '1'. Since `row` has at least 3 characters, `nRow` will now have one additional character '1' appended to its previous value. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` plus '1'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` plus '1'**
