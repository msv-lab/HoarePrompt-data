The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. However, `nRow` was not defined in the initial state, so there is no previous value to reference. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to be the previous value concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to be the previous value concatenated with '1'**.
