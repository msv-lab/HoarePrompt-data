The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to its previous value. The list `res` remains unchanged, and the string `row` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `nRow` while keeping the other variables as they were. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` has been updated by appending '1'**
