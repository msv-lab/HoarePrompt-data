The code `nRow += i` attempts to concatenate the value of `i` to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is 0, the result of this operation will be that `nRow` becomes the string representation of `0`. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
