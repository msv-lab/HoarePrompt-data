`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is '11' (a string) and the value of `i` is 11 (an integer). When adding a string and an integer, Python will raise a TypeError because they are incompatible types for addition. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is an error regarding the operation.

Output State: **TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str**
