According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of 9 times, iterating with the variable `i` starting from 0 up to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9. Since the loop is defined to run for `i` in the range of 9, when `i` is 9, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `res` now includes `nRow`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be 9, but it cannot execute again as the range ends at 9.**
