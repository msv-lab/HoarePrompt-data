According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of 9 times, ranging from `i = 0` to `i = 8`. The variable `i` needs to be less than 9 for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and the loop has completed its last iteration with `i` at 8. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9, which is equal to the upper limit of the range. 

Since the loop will not execute again when `i` reaches 9, the loop cannot run a second time. Therefore, the states need to reflect that the loop cannot proceed further.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `res` now includes an additional `nRow`, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9 (but it is 9 now)**
