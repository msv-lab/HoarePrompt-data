To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze how the loop modifies the variables based on the given code.

The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `row`. If `i` is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`; otherwise, it appends the character `i` itself. 

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `row` is a non-empty string, which means it contains characters that could be '9' or other digits.
   - `nRow` starts as an empty string.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character in `row`, if it is '9', it converts it to '1' in `nRow`.
   - If the character is any other digit, it appends that digit to `nRow`.

3. **Final Output State**:
   - After the loop has executed through all characters in `row`, `nRow` will hold a string that is formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.

Thus, we can conclude the final output state based on the transformations made by the loop.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'.**
