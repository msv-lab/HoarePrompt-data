Postcondition: ***`input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by 1, and `input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters.***
