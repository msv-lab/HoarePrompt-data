According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the string `row`. Since `i` is currently the first character of `row`, the loop will iterate over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row`, which influences the value of `nRow`. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` gets updated to be the previous value concatenated with '1'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The next value of `i` will be the second character of `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `row` has at least 2 characters.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the second character of `row`, and for the loop to execute again, `row` must contain at least 2 characters.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character of `row`, and the value of `nRow` will depend on the first character of `row`.**
