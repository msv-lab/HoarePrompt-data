The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the second character of `row`, it will be a specific character from that string. The output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated with this new value, while the states of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.**
