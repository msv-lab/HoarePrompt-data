The loop reads a line of input 9 times, processes each line by replacing occurrences of '9' with '1', and appends the resulting string to the `res` list. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `res` will contain 9 strings, each derived from the corresponding input row, with all '9's replaced by '1's. The value of `row` would be a non-empty string for each iteration, and `nRow` would be the processed version of `row` for each iteration.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, each being the corresponding input row with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'.**
