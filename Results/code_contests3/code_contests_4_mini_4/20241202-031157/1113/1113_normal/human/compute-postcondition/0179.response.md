The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` was not previously defined in the initial state, we can assume it is initialized to a default value (likely an empty string or 0). The variable `i` is the third character of `row`, which is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters. Therefore, in this case, `i` is a specific character from `row`. 

The output state will reflect that `nRow` is being updated based on its previous value combined with the value of `i`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus the third character of `row`.**
