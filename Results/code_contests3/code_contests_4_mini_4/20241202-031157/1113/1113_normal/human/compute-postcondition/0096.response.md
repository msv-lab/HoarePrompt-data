The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that '1' is concatenated to whatever the current value of `nRow` is. The initial value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will be updated by appending '1' to it. The other variable `row` remains unchanged, and `i` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**
