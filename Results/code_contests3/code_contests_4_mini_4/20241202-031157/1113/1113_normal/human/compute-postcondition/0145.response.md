According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to run for `i` in the range of 9, which means `i` takes values from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to execute one more time. Since the loop is supposed to run for `i` from 0 to 8, if `i` reaches 9, the loop cannot execute again.

Given that `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 9**
