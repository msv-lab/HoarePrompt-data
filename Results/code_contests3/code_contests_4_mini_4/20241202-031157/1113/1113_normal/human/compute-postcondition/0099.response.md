According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute again, `row` must have characters remaining for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. 

Since `i` is the second character, for the loop to continue to the next iteration, `i` will now be the third character of `row`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least three characters.

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a third time `row` must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`**
