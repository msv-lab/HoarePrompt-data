The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` remains unchanged, but now it is overwritten with an empty string. The states of the other variables (`row`, `res`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is 9 and does not allow the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` remains unchanged, `i` is 9 and does not allow the loop to execute again.**
