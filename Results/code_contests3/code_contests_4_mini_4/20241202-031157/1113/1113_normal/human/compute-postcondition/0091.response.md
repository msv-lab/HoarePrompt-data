`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**
