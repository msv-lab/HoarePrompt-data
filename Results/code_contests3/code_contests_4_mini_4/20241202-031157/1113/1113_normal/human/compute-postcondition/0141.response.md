The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `i` is the next character in `row`, it implies that `i` holds a specific character value. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will be updated by adding `i` to it. The list `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i` to its previous value.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i` to its previous value**
