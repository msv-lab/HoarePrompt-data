According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `row`. If `row` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means we are currently processing the 9th character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has more characters, thus the loop can execute one more time. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` will need to be incremented to the next character in `row`, which would be '10'. The value of `nRow` continues to include the previous value, and `res` will include an additional entry (the value of `nRow`). The states of `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged.

State: **`nRow` is '1', `i` is '10', `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), while `input`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged**.
