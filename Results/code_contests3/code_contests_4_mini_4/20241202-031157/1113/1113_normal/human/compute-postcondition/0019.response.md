The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is currently 1. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `nRow`, we cannot determine its final value. However, we can state that `nRow` will be increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is increased by 1, `input` is assigned the value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters.**
