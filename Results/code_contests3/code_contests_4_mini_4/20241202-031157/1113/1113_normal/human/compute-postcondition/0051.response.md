The variable `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will now be '1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9', `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` includes an additional entry (the value of `nRow`), `input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, and `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity.
