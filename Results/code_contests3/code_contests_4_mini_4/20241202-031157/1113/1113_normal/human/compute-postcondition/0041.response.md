The code appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is a list, this operation will add '1' as an element to the list. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`input` is assigned a value from standard input, `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains the value of `nRow` in a list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1' as a new element.**
