The code assigns the value `'1'` to `nRow` by concatenating it to its previous value. The initial state indicates that `row` has at least one more character after this operation, which allows the loop to execute one more time. Other variables `res` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings; `row` has at least one more character; `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings; `row` has at least one more character; `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1'**.
