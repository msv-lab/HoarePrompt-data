According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. 

Given that `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, we need to confirm that it is not empty. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, which is likely intended to be used for something else in the program but does not affect the loop execution directly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be considered:
- `row` must contain at least 1 character (i.e., it cannot be an empty string).
- `i` will be set to the first character of `row` during the first iteration, so it does not need to be changed beforehand.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `i` will represent the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace**
