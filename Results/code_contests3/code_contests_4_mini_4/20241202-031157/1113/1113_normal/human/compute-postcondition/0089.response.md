According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must be a non-empty string. The variable `i` will take on the value of the first character in `row` during the first iteration. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not influence the execution of the loop. 

State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
