`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, the value of `nRow` becomes the first character of `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
