The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect any other variables present in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`input` remains assigned as a function that reads a line from the standard input; `write` is still assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` contains 9 entries with '9' replaced by '1'; `T` is greater than 1; `t` is 1; `i` is 0; `row` is assigned the stripped value of the input line; `nRow` is assigned an empty string.**
