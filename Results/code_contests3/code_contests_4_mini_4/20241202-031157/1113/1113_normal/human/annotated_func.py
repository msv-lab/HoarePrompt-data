#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases where each test case consists of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters representing a valid Sudoku solution, with characters ranging from '1' to '9' and no whitespace.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `input` is assigned a value of a function that reads a line from the standard input, `write` is assigned the value of `sys.stdout.write`, `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity, `res` contains `9 * T` entries, each being the string formed by replacing every '9' in the corresponding input `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged, `T` is a positive integer.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and processes each test case consisting of 9 lines of Sudoku rows. It replaces each occurrence of '9' in the input rows with '1' and outputs the modified rows. The function does not validate the Sudoku solution but merely transforms the input according to the specified rule.
