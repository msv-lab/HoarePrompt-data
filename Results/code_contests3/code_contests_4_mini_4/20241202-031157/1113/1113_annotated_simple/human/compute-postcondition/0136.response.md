The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The initial value of `nRow` is '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The values of the other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '11', and `i` is the second character in `row`.**
