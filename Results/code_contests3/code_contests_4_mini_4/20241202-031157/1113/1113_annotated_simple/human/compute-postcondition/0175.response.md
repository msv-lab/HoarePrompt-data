The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the 10th character of `row`. The previous state does not specify the value of `nRow`, but it will be updated by adding the character `i` to its current value. The values of `maxint`, `res`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.**
