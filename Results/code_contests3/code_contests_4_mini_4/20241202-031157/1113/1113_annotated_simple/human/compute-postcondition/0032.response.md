The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
