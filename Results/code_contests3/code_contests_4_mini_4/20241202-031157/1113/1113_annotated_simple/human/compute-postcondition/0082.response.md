The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the next character `i` from the string `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will now include the next character from `row` after execution. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row**.
