The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `maxint` and `res` remain unchanged. There are no calculations or changes to the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
