The value of `nRow` is concatenated with `i`, but the value of `i` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `nRow`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is '', and `i` is not defined.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is '', and `i` is not defined.**
