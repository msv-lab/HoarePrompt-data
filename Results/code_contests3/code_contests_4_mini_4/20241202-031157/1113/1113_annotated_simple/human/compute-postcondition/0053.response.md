The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating it with `i`. Since `i` is 9 and not equal to the string '9', it will be treated as an integer in this context. The initial value of `nRow` is an empty string, so after the operation `nRow += i`, `nRow` will now contain the string representation of `i`, which is '9'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is '9', and `i` is 9.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is '9', and `i` is 9.**
