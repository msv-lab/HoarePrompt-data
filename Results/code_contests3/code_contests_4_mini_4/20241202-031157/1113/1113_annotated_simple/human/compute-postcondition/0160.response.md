In the given code snippet, `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next character in the string `row`, the value of `i` will be a string. Therefore, `nRow` will also be a string after the operation. The previous values of `maxint`, `res`, and `row` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string containing at least one more character after '9', `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
