According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` string. The loop iterates over each character in `row`, and since `i` is currently '9', it indicates that the loop has processed 9 characters so far. The `row` has at least 10 characters, which means there is still at least one more character left to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 11 strings, and `row` has at least 10 characters. The character that `i` will take next is the 10th character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be set to the 10th character of `row`, and the index will be 10 (since indexing starts at 0). Thus, the state needs to reflect that `row` has at least 11 characters for the loop to continue.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`**
