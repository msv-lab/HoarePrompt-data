`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, `i` has a specific value which is the next character in `row`. The variable `maxint` remains unchanged, and `res` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` after concatenating `i`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`.**
