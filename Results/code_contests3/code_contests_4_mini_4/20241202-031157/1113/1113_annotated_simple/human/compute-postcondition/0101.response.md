The variable `nRow` is being updated by adding the value of `i` to it. However, since the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state must reflect the change to `nRow` without specifying its exact value.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 11th character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.**
