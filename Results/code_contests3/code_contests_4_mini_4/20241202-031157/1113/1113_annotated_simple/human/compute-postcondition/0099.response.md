According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, which implies that the loop has iterated through the first 10 characters. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 10 characters, there are still more characters to iterate over if `row` has more than 10 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated with '1' appended to its original value. If `i` is any character other than '9', then `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the 11th character of `row`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least 11 characters for the loop to continue. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 11th character of `row`.**
