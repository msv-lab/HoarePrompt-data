`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. The previous state of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now have an additional character `'1'` appended to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string containing at least one more character after '9', `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.
