The `res` list is updated by appending the value of `nRow` to it. The previous state of `res` contains 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, and `nRow` is defined as the transformed version of `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1'. The value of `maxint`, `row`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, and `i` is the last character in `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, `i` is the last character in `row**.
