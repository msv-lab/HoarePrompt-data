According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty input string and `i` is set to the next character after '9', the loop can continue to iterate through the characters in `row`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the character immediately after '9'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character in `row`. Given that `row` contains at least one more character after '9', `i` will be set to this next character, which will allow the loop to continue executing. 

The state of `nRow` changes based on whether `i` is '9' or not. If `i` is '9', `nRow` will be '1' concatenated to its previous value. If `i` is any other character, `nRow` will be increased by `i`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the next character in `row`, `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on the value of `i`, and the `res` state remains unchanged as it only depends on the number of strings processed so far. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string containing at least one more character after '9', `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`.**
