The `nRow` variable is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string (`''`), after executing the code, `nRow` becomes `'1'`. The values of the other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'**.
