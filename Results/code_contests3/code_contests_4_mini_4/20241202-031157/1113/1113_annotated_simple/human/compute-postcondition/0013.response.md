The code attempts to concatenate the string '1' to the variable `nRow`, but `nRow` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, this operation cannot be completed, and no variables are modified. The output state reflects the existing values and the error regarding the undefined variable.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, and an error occurred due to `nRow` being undefined.**
