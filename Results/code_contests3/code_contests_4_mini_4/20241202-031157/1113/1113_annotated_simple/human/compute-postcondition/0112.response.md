`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string (`''`), and `i` is `0`. Therefore, the result of the concatenation will be `'' + 0`, which results in the string `'0'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
