According to the code, the loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by `range(9)`, which means it will execute for `i` values from 0 to 8. Since the last iteration is for `i` equal to 8, there will not be an additional iteration for `i` equal to 9, as the range does not include 9. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition would have to be adjusted to allow `i` to be 9, which is not possible with the current loop structure.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is the original non-empty input string, `nRow` is the transformed string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced with '1', and for the loop to execute a second time `i` would need to be 9, which is not possible.**
