`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 1, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 1, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
