Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string containing at least one more character after '9', `i` is the next character in `row`, and if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include `i`.***
