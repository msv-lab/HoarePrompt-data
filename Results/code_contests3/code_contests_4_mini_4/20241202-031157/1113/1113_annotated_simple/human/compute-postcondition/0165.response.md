The variable `row` is assigned the value of the input after stripping whitespace from both ends. The other variables, `maxint`, `res`, `nRow`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The state of `row` will depend on the user's input. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is the transformed string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced with '1', and for the loop to execute a second time `i` would need to be 9, which is not possible.
