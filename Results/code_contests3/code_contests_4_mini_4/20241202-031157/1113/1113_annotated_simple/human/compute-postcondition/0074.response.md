The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the character `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be the first character of `row`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and character `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and character `i` is not equal to '9'**.
