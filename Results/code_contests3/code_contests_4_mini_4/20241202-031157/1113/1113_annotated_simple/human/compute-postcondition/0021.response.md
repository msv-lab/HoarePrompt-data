According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more character after the current `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is '9'. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, we need to check the next character in `row`. 

If `i` is '9' for the current iteration, then `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`. For the loop to run again, `i` must be the next character in `row`, which will be the character at the next index. 

Assuming `row` has at least one more character beyond the current index, we can determine that `i` will be the next character and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time `nRow` will be updated to the concatenation of `nRow` and the next character in `row`, and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
