According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `row` string. If `i` is less than the length of `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1', and `i` remains 9, meaning the loop would not execute again as there are no more characters to iterate over. However, if `i` is not '9', then `nRow` would be updated to the value of `i`, which is not equal to '9'. 

Since `i` is currently equal to '9', for the loop to execute again, the next value of `i` must be one of the characters in `row`, and `row` must have at least one more character beyond '9'. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next character in `row` following '9'.**
