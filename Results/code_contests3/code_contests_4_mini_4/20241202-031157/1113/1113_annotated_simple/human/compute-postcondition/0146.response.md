The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of other variables such as `maxint`, `res`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, `i` is 9**
