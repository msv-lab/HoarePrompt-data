According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times since it iterates over the range of 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`. Given that the loop has iterated 9 times, the current value of `i` must be 8 (as the loop index starts from 0). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be 9. However, since the loop only defines a range of 9, it will not execute again if `i` is already at 8 (the last valid index). 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `res` remains as a list containing 9 strings plus `nRow`, `row` remains a non-empty string, `nRow` is still a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', and `i` should be incremented to 9. 

However, since the loop cannot execute again, we state that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be beyond the range of 9, which is not possible given the current structure of the loop. 

Thus, the state would be as follows:

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9, but for the loop to execute again, it cannot since it has completed 9 iterations.**
