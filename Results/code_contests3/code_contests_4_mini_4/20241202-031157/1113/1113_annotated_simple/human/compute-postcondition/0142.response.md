Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is either '111' (if `i` is '9') or '1' concatenated with `i` followed by '1' (if `i` is '9'). If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is updated to '119' (if `i` is '9') or '1' concatenated with `i`.***
