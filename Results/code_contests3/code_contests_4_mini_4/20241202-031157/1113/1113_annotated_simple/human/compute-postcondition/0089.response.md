According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. 

Since `row` is an input string, for the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. The current value of `i` being 9 is irrelevant for the loop execution since it will be redefined by the loop iteration.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `row` must contain at least one character and reset `i` to the first character in `row` (which will be set by the loop itself).

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `i` is the first character of row**
