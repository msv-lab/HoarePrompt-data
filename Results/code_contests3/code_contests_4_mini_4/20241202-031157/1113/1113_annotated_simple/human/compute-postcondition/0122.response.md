To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop, we note the following:

1. The loop iterates over each character in the input string `row`.
2. For each character in `row`:
   - If the character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`.
   - If the character is anything else, that character is appended to `nRow`.

Given that `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. After all iterations, `nRow` will contain a string that consists of the characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. 

The values of `maxint` and `res` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.

Therefore, the final output state is:

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1', and keeping all other characters the same.**
