According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If `row` contains more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, since `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is 9, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to the next character in `row`. 

Since `i` is currently '9', it suggests that the loop will not execute again unless the next character exists and `i` is not '9'. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to represent the next character in the string `row`, and we need to ensure that `row` has at least one more character after '9'.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `row` must have at least one more character after '9', and `i` must be the next character in `row`.**
