The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `maxint` and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer.

Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer**
