Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to the concatenation of its previous value and '1', and `i` is assigned the next character in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row`, and `i` is also the next character from `row`.***
