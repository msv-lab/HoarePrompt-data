To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior. The loop iterates 9 times, and during each iteration, it processes an input string `row`, transforming it into `nRow` by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1'. Each transformed string `nRow` is then appended to the `res` list.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `maxint` is positive infinity.
   - `res` starts with 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings (total of 18 strings).
   - `row` is the last non-empty string input.
   - `nRow` is the last transformed version of `row`.
   - `i` is the last character of the last `row`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - In each of the 9 iterations, an input string is read and transformed.
   - After the first iteration, `res` will contain 10 strings (9 original + 1 transformed).
   - After the second iteration, `res` will contain 11 strings (10 original + 1 transformed).
   - This pattern continues until the loop finishes.

3. **Final State After 9 Iterations**:
   - After all 9 iterations, `res` will contain 18 strings (9 original strings from the last 9 inputs + 9 transformed strings).
   - `row` will be the last non-empty string input after the 9th iteration.
   - `nRow` will be the transformed version of that last `row`, where every '9' is replaced with '1'.
   - `i` will be the last character of the last input `row`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all 9 times can be summarized as:

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 18 strings (9 original strings plus 9 transformed strings), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, with every '9' replaced by '1', `i` is the last character in `row`.**
