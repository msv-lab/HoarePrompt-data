The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. None of the other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `i`, `row`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `nRow` is an empty string**
