According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:

1. `row` should not be an empty string; it should contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
2. Initially, `i` is 0, which is the starting index for iteration over the string.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `row` must be a non-empty string, `i` will be the index of the first character in `row`, and the first character will be the first character of the string.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the index of the first character in `row`**
