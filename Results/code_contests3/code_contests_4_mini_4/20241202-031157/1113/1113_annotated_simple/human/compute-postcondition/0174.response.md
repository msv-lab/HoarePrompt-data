`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables are not affected, so the output state remains unchanged for them. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, and `nRow` has been updated to include an additional character `'1'`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, and `nRow` has been updated to include an additional character '1'.**
