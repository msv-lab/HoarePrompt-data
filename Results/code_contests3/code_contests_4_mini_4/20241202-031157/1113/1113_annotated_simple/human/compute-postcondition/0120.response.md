`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9', the value of `i` will be a character that can be concatenated to `nRow`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i`.**
