The loop processes each character in the input string `row`. For every occurrence of '9', it appends '1' to the string `nRow`, and for all other characters, it appends the character itself to `nRow`. After the loop executes for all characters in `row`, `nRow` will contain a string where every '9' in `row` has been replaced with '1', and all other characters remain unchanged.

If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for every character in `row`. The final state of `nRow` will be a transformation of `row`, where all '9's have been converted to '1's. Therefore, `res` will ultimately contain `nRow`, which reflects this transformation.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.**
