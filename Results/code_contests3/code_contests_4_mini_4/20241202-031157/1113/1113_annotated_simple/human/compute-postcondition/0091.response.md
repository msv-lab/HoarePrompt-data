The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` plus the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, concatenating '1' to it results in `nRow` being equal to '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**
