Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 10 characters, and `i` is the 10th character of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated with '1' appended to its original value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the value of `i`.***
