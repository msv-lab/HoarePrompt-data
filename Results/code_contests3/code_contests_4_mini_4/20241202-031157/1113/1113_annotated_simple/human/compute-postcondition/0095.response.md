According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means the loop has completed iterating through the characters of `row`. If `row` has more than 9 characters, the loop can execute one more time with the next character in `row`. Since `i` was '9', the next character would be the 10th character in `row`. 

If `row` has at least 10 characters, `nRow` will remain unchanged as it is not concatenated with the first character of `row` yet (given that `i` is '9'). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`, which would be the 10th character, and `nRow` must be as it was at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 10 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, and `nRow` remains as it was.**
