The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but since it is being reassigned, its prior value is effectively discarded. Other variables such as `maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is an empty string, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` would need to be 9, which is not possible.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is the input string, `nRow` is an empty string, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` would need to be 9, which is not possible.**
