According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` can take on the values from the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9', which means `nRow` was set to '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to take on the next character in `row`. Since `row` is non-empty, `i` can be incremented to the next character.

Assuming `row` had at least 10 characters, the next value for `i` would move from '9' to the next character in the string. If there are no more characters in `row`, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 11 characters, and `i` is the next character in the string `row` after '9'.**
