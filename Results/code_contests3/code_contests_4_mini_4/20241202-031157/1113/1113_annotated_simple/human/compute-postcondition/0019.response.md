The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Given that `nRow` was previously undefined in the initial state, we cannot determine its prior value. However, `i` is the next character in `row`, which means it has a specific character value from `row`. The execution of this line will concatenate `i` to `nRow`. Since the previous state of `nRow` is unknown, we can only note that it will receive a new value based on the character `i`. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is assigned a new value based on the concatenation of `nRow` and `i`.**
