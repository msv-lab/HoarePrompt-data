According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must be a non-empty string. Given that `row` is the latest non-empty string input, it should contain at least one character. Additionally, `i` is already set to 1, which will be overwritten by the first character of `row` in the first execution.

For the loop to execute the second time, `t` must be less than `T`, but this condition pertains to the loop body and does not affect the state before the loop starts.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
