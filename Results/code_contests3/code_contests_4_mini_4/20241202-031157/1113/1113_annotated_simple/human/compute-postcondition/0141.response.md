`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the third character in `row`. If the third character is '9', `nRow` would be '11' concatenated with '9', resulting in '119'. If the third character is something else, `nRow` would be '1' concatenated with that character. Therefore, the value of `nRow` is dependent on the third character of `row`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to either '119' (if `i` is '9') or '1' concatenated with `i`.**
