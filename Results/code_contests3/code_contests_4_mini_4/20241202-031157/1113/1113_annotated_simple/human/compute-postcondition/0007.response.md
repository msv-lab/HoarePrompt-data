According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The current states of `maxint` and `res` do not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed for the first time, `T` must be greater than 0, and `t` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0**
