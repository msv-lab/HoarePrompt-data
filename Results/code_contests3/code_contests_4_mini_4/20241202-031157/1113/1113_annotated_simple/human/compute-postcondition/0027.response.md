According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times as defined by the range function. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, which is the last valid index for the range of 9. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` would need to be 9, but since the loop is defined to stop before reaching this value, it cannot execute again. 

Thus, the relevant states to be adjusted are:
- `i` becomes 9 (the next value after the last iteration).
- The loop can no longer execute as it would require `i` to be less than 9.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9 for the loop to not execute again.**
