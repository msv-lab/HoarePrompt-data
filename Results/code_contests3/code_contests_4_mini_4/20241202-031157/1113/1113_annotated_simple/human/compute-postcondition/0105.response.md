According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which will iterate from 0 to 8 (inclusive) given the range of 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Since the loop runs while `i` is less than 9, for it to execute again, `i` must be 9, which is outside the current range of values for `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', and `i` is the last character of `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 9.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9**
