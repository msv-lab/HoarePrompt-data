The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` was a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in the input `row` with '1', but now it is overwritten with an empty string. Other variables are not affected, and since the loop cannot execute again, the state remains unchanged for them. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9**
