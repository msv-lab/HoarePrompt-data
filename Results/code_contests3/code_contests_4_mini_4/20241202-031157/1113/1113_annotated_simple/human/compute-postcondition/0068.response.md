The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes an input string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `nRow`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', `i` is 0.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', `i` is 0.**
