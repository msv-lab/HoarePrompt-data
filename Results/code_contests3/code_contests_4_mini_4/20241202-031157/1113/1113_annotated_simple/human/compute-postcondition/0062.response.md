Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, and `i` is the 10th character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the 10th character in `row`.***
