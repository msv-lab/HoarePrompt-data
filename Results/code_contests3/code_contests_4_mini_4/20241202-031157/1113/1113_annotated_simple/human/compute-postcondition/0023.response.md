`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. The value of `nRow` will be updated to include this next character. Other variables are not affected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row`, and `i` is the next character from `row`. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row`, `i` is the next character from `row`**
