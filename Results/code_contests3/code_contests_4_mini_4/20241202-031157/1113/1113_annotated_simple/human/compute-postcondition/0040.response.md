According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'. Since `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character, and `i` will be the next character in `row`. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more character, `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
