The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', resulting in a new value for `nRow`. The other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `row`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 10 characters, `i` is the 10th character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated with '1' appended to its original value.
