The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
