Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1', and `row` must have at least one more character for the loop to execute a second time; `i` will be the next character in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i`, with `row` remaining a non-empty string, and `i` being the next character in `row`.***
