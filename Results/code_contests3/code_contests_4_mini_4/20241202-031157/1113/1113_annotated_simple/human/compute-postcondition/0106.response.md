The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which reads a non-empty string from input and removes any surrounding whitespace. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `nRow`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9**
