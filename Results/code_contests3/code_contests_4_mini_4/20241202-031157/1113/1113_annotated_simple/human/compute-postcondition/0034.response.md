In the provided code snippet, `nRow` is being updated by concatenating the current value of `i` to it. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', implying `i` holds a character from `row` that is not '9'. Therefore, after the execution of `nRow += i`, `nRow` will become a string that contains the character `i`.

Since `nRow` was initially an empty string, after the operation it will now contain the value of `i`. The states of other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `row`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `i` is not equal to '9'**.
