According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`, which represents the number of iterations the loop is intended to run. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the current iteration index, and it has completed one iteration. Since `t` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than `t + 1`.

Given that `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings (which is a result of some transformation), `row` is the last non-empty string input, and `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, we do not need to adjust those states for the next iteration.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is the last non-empty string input, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', for the loop to execute one more time `T` must be greater than `t + 1`**
