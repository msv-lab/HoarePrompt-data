Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '11' and `i` is the second character in `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' and the character `i`, and `i` remains the second character in `row`.***
