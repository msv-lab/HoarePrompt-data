The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow`, which was formed by replacing every '9' in the previous `row` with '1', is now overwritten by this new assignment. The other variables, including `maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is the new input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is the new input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9**
