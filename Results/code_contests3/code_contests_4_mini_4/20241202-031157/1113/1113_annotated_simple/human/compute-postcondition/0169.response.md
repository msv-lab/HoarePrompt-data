The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the current value of `nRow`. Since the initial state specifies that `nRow` is an empty string, after the execution of this line, `nRow` will now contain the string `'1'`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**
