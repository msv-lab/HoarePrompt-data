`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the first character of `row`, which is not '9', and `nRow` is initially an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the first character of `row`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`**
