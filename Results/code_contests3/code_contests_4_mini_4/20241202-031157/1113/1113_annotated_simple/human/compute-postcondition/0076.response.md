According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character. 

If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is set to '1' and the loop will not execute again, as all characters in `row` have been iterated. However, since we are adjusting for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the last character processed and prepare for the next character.

Given that `i` is not equal to '9', the next character to be processed in the next iteration of the loop will be the next character in `row`. The total number of characters in `row` will determine how many times the loop can continue executing. 

To summarize, if `row` has a length greater than 1, and since `i` is not '9', we can determine that `i` will be the next character in `row`, and it should be the next character after the last processed character.

Letâ€™s assume `row` has at least two characters for the loop to execute again. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to the next character in `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be the next character in `row`**
