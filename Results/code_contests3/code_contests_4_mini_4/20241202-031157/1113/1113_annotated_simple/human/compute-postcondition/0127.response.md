The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will now hold the latest non-empty string input after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is the latest non-empty string input, `nRow` is the last transformed version of `row`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `t` must be less than T.
