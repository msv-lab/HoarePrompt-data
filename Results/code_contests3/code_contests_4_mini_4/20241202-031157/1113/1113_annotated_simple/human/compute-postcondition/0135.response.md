According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` represents the current character in the string during each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means that the loop has processed the first character of `row`.

Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take the next character in the string `row`. Therefore, if `row` consists of more characters, `i` will be the next character after the first character.

As `i` progresses through the characters in `row`, if `i` is currently the first character (1), then the next character will be the second character in the string. Hence, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the second character of `row`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is the second character in `row` (which corresponds to the index 1). For the loop to execute a second time, `row` must have at least 2 characters.**
