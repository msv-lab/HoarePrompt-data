According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates through each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, the next iteration of the loop will take place if there are more characters in `row` after the current position of `i`.

Given that `i` is currently the second character in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`, which is the third character. Additionally, `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on the new value of `i`. 

Thus, we conclude that:
- `i` will be the third character in `row`.
- `nRow` will be determined based on whether the new `i` is '9' or not.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time `nRow` is either '11' (if the third character is '9') or the concatenation of '1' and the third character.**
