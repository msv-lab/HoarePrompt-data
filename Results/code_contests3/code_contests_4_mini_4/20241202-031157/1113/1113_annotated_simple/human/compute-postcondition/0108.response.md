According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The `for` loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must be a non-empty string. 

Currently, `nRow` is an empty string, which suggests that `row` might also be empty if it is not initialized or filled with any value before the loop. Since `i` is set to 9, this indicates the last index from a previous iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` is a non-empty string and also that `i` is adjusted to represent the first character in `row` (which will be 0 when the loop starts).

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
