According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty input string, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left to process. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that in the next iteration, `i` will be assigned to the next character in the `row` string. The loop will continue to execute until all characters in `row` have been processed.

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1', but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. The next character assigned to `i` will depend on the length of `row`. Since `row` has not been defined in terms of its length, I can only conclude that `i` will take on the next character from `row`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character after '9'.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string containing at least one more character after '9', `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'**
