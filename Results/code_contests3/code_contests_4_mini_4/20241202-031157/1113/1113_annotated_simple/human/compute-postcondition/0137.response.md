`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', and the value of `i` is the second character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `i` is a valid character. The output will be the concatenation of '1' and `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' and the character `i`, and `i` is the second character in `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' and the character `i`, `i` is the second character in `row`.**
