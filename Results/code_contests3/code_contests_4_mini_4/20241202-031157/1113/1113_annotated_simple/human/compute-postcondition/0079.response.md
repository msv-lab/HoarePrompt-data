Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the next character in `row`.***
