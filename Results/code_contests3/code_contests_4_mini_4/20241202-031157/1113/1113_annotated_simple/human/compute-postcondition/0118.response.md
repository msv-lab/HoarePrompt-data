According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `row`, which is a non-empty string. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which indicates that `nRow` has been updated to include '1' at the end. 

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must still contain more characters after the current character being processed. Since `i` is '9', it means that the loop had processed the last character in the current iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after '9', and `i` will take the next character from `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string with at least one more character after '9', and for the loop to execute again, `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
