Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases of valid Sudoku solutions, each represented by 9 lines of 9 digits. It replaces every occurrence of '9' in the input with '1' and outputs the modified Sudoku solutions as a single string without returning any specific value. The function does not validate the Sudoku solutions and assumes the input is always valid. **
