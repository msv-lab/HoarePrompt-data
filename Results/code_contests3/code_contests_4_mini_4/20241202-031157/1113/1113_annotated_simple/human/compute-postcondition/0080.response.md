According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the content of `row`. Given that `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that in the next iteration, `nRow` will be assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `row`.
- Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character, and if `i` is currently '9', it means that there are more characters in `row` to process.

Thus, we will move to the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters, we will be able to execute the loop again. The value of `i` will change to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `i` will be the next character in `row` and `nRow` will be assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the next character in `row`.**
