According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The `for` loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` must not be empty. Since `i` is currently set to 9, it will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the first iteration.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `row` contains at least one character. Thus, the state should include that `row` is a non-empty string and `i` will be set to the first character of `row`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is '', `i` is the first character in `row`**
