`res` is a list that contains 11 strings, and `nRow` is a string derived from `row`, with every '9' replaced by '1'. The operation `res.append(nRow)` adds `nRow` to the end of the list `res`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 12 strings (with `nRow` added), `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` now contains 12 strings, `row` is a string with at least 10 characters, `nRow` is `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'**.
