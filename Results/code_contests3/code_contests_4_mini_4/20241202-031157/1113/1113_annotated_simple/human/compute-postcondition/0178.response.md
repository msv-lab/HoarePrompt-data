`nRow` is assigned the value of '1' concatenated to its previous value. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. The variables `maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 11 strings, `row` is a string with at least 12 characters, `i` is the 11th character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by '1' (its previous value is unknown).
