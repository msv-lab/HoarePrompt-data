The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means we are concatenating the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is determined based on the value of the third character in `row`. If the third character is '9', then `nRow` is initialized to '11'. If it is any other character, `nRow` is the concatenation of '1' and that character.

Therefore, after executing the code, `nRow` will either be '111' (if the third character is '9') or '1' concatenated with the third character followed by '1'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, `nRow` is either '111' (if the third character is '9') or concatenated '1' and the third character followed by '1'.**
