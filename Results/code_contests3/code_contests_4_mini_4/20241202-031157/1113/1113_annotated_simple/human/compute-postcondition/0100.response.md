The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'1'`. The variable `nRow` was not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is updated by appending `'1'` to its previous value, which is unknown.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 11th character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.**
