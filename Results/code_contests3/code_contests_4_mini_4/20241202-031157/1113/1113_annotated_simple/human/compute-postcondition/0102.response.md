Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 11 characters, `i` is the 11th character of `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.***
