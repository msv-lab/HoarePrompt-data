The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous state of `nRow` was the result of replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', but now it is reset to an empty string. Other variables remain unchanged as their values are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` must be 9 for the loop to execute one more time.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` must be 9 for the loop to execute one more time.**
