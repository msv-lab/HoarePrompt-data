To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the provided loop code and the variable states:

Initial State: 
- `maxint` is positive infinity
- `res` is a list containing the transformed string
- `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace
- `nRow` is an empty string
- `i` must be 9 for the loop to execute one more time

The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. During each iteration:
- If the character `i` is equal to '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- If `i` is not '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

After the loop executes for all characters in `row`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- Since `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, the loop will execute for every character in `row`.
- The final value of `nRow` will be constructed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop:
- `maxint` remains positive infinity
- `res` would still be a list containing the transformed string (which may include `nRow` after processing).
- `row` is unchanged and still a string with at least 9 characters.
- `nRow` will be a string derived from `row`, with every '9' replaced by '1'.
- The final value of `i` will be the last character of `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string based on `row`, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', and `i` is the last character of `row`.**
