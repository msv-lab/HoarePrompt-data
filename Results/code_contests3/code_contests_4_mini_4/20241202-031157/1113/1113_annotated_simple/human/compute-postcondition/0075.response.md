Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is set to the first character of `row`, and `i` is set to the first character of `row`, with `i` being not equal to '9'.***
