The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This directly affects the value of `nRow`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0**
