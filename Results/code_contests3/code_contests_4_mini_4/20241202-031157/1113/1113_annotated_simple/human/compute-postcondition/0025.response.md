To analyze the state of the variables after the loop has executed, we observe the behavior of the loop according to the provided code.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For every character `i`:
- If `i` is equal to '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- Otherwise, it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

Given that:
- `maxint` is positive infinity (remains unchanged).
- `res` is an empty list (remains unchanged).
- `row` is a non-empty string (its content is processed but is not modified).
- `nRow` accumulates characters from `row`, replacing '9' with '1'.

After the loop executes over the entire string `row`, `nRow` will consist of all characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.**
