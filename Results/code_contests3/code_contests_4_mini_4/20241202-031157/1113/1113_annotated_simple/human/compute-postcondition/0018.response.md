The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. However, we know that `nRow` will now contain '1' appended to whatever it previously held. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'` (where `nRow` is undefined in the initial state).

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'` (where `nRow` is undefined in the initial state).**
