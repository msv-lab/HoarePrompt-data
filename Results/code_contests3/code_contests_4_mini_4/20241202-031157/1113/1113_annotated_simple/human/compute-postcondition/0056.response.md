The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, but it will now have an additional character '1' added to it. The other variables `maxint`, `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is now increased by one character.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the transformed string, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `i` is '9', `nRow` is now increased by one character.**
