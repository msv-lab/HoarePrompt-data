Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is 1. If `i` is equal to '9', then the program will proceed with the corresponding logic for this condition. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', the program will proceed with the logic for the else condition.***
