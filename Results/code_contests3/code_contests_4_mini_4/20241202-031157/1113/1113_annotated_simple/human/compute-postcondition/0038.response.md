`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `i` must be the next character in `row` following '9', it is a valid character (e.g., '0' through '9' or any character depending on the context). The value of `maxint` and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing the updated `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
