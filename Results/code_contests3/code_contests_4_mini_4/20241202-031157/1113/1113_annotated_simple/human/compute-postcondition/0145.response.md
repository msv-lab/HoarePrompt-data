According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate 9 times, specifically from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`, but since `i` is expected to be an integer for the range loop, we can conclude that it has reached 8 (the last valid index for the loop). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented, making it 9, which is the terminating condition for the loop. Additionally, the loop must be able to execute a total of 9 times, which means that `i` needs to be less than 9. 

Since `i` is currently at 8, we can adjust it for the next iteration. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` contains 10 strings plus 9 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, `i` is 9 for the loop to execute a tenth time**
