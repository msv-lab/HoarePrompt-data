The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`, which overrides its previous value that was the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is no longer relevant after this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 strings (including `nRow`), `row` is an input string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9**
