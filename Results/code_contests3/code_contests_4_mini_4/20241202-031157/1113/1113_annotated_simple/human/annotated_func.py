#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases, each containing 9 lines of 9 characters (digits from '1' to '9') representing a valid sudoku solution.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `T * 9` strings formed by replacing '9' with '1' in each corresponding input row, `row` is the last non-empty string input, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', `i` is the last character of `row`.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases of valid Sudoku solutions, each represented by 9 lines of 9 digits. It replaces every occurrence of '9' in the input with '1' and outputs the modified Sudoku solutions as a single string without returning any specific value. The function does not validate the Sudoku solutions and assumes the input is always valid.
