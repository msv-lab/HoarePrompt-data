Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to modify a Sudoku solution to create an anti-Sudoku by changing the digit '9' to '1'. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting grid satisfies the conditions of an anti-Sudoku for all cases. 

For example, consider the following input grid:

```
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
999999999
```

After running the program, the output will be:

```
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
111111111
```

In this case, although every row contains at least two equal elements (they are all '1's), the program does not ensure that it changes at most 9 elements and still maintains the anti-Sudoku properties for each column and block. Here, all columns and all 3x3 blocks contain only one unique value ('1'), which does not satisfy the requirement of having at least two equal elements in each column and block.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input case and potentially others, making it incorrect.
