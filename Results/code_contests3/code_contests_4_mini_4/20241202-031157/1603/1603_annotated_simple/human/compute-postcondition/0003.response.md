Functionality: ** The function accepts two implicit parameters `n` (the number of flower positions) and `m` (the number of visitors), and it prints a string composed of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not process the visitor ranges or produce any output based on them, which is a significant omission from the annotations. **
