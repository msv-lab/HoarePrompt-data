The code snippet prints a string that consists of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd (checked by `n & 1`), or an empty string if `n` is even. The values of `m` and `n` are affected by the input values but are not specified here. Assuming `n` is a positive integer within the given constraints, the output will depend entirely on the value of `n`.

Since there are no specific input values provided for `n` and `m`, the output state will reflect the general logic of the code:

- If `n` is even, the output will be '10' repeated `n // 2` times.
- If `n` is odd, the output will be '10' repeated `n // 2` times followed by '1'.

Thus, the output state is contingent upon the value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000); output is '10' repeated (n // 2) times + ('1' if n is odd else '')**
