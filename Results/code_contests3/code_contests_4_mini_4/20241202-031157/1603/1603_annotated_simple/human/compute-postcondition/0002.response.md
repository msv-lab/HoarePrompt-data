The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. However, it operates based on two constraints: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of flower positions, and `m`, which is a positive integer representing the number of visitors. Additionally, the function processes each visitor's range `(l_i, r_i)`, which consists of two integers adhering to the conditions 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. 

As for the output, the function's behavior is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it will yield results based on the processing of the flower positions and the visitors' ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters n and m (representing the number of flower positions and visitors, respectively), and it processes visitors' ranges to produce an output based on the given constraints.**
