#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of flower positions, m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the number of visitors, and each visitor's range (l_i, r_i) consists of two integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print('10' * (n // 2) + ('1' if n & 1 else ''))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two implicit parameters `n` (the number of flower positions) and `m` (the number of visitors), and it prints a string composed of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. The function does not process the visitor ranges or produce any output based on them, which is a significant omission from the annotations.
