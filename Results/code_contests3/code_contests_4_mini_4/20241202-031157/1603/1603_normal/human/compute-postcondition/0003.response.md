Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` (the number of flowers) and `m` (the number of visitors), but it does not utilize the number of visitors or their ranges. It generates and prints a string consisting of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd. Thus, it only outputs a specific pattern based on the number of flowers and ignores the visitor-related input entirely. **
