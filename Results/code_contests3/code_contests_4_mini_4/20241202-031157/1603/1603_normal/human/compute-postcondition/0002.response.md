The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. However, it operates with the constraints that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). Additionally, for each visitor, there is a range denoted as (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The function processes these inputs to ultimately return specific results based on the given ranges for the visitors.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of flowers and visitors as constraints and processes ranges provided for each visitor to return specific results based on those ranges.**
