The code assigns values to `n` and `m` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it accepts input in the form of two space-separated integers and converts them into integers. Since `n` and `m` are already defined as positive integers representing the number of flowers and visitors, their values will be updated based on the input provided. The previous values of `n` and `m` will be replaced, but without specific input values, we cannot determine the new values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to the input integer for flowers, `m` is updated to the input integer for visitors.
Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer for flowers, `m` is updated to the input integer for visitors.**
