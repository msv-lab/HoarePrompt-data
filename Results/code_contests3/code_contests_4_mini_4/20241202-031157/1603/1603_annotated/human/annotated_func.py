#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of flowers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is a positive integer representing the number of visitors (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and each visitor's segment is defined by two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n).
def func():
    n, m = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print('10' * (n // 2) + ('1' if n & 1 else ''))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers, `n` (the number of flowers) and `m` (the number of visitors), from input. It then generates and prints a string consisting of the digit '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd, resulting in a string of length `n`. However, the function does not utilize the variable `m` or any visitor segments, and does not handle any operations related to the visitors as suggested by the annotations.
