The code constructs a string based on the value of `n`. Specifically, it repeats the string '10' for half the value of `n` (using integer division) and appends '1' if `n` is odd (indicated by `n & 1`), otherwise it appends an empty string. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this code snippet, but they determine how the output string is formed.

If `n` is even, the output string will consist solely of '10' repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is odd, it will consist of '10' repeated `n // 2` times followed by '1'.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; the output string is '10' repeated `n // 2` times followed by '1' if `n` is odd, otherwise it ends with an empty string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `m` is a positive integer; the output string is '10' repeated `n // 2` times followed by '1' if `n` is odd, otherwise it ends with an empty string.**
