The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined to take no arguments. However, it operates with the constraints that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). Additionally, each visitor's segment is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n).

The output of the function is determined based on these constraints. However, since the specific return values or cases are not provided, we cannot describe them in detail. Therefore, we can only state the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates with `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) representing the number of flowers and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) representing the number of visitors. Each visitor's segment is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n).**
