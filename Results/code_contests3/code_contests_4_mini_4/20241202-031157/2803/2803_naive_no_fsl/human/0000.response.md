To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and how it relates to the requirements.

The problem indicates that we need to find the largest xor-sum of candies, with the constraint that Grisha can take no more than `k` candies out of `n` candies, where tastiness ranges from `1` to `n`.

The provided program is:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Understanding the Output Logic**:
   - The program calculates the bit-length of `n` using `len(bin(n)[2:])`, which gives the number of bits needed to represent `n`.
   - It computes `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`. This expression evaluates to the largest number that can be represented with those bits, which is equivalent to `2^m - 1` where `m` is the number of bits. This is effectively `111...1` in binary, which is the maximum xor-sum obtainable with `m` bits.
   - If `k - 1` is `False` (meaning `k` is `1`), it returns `n`. This seems to imply that if Grisha can only take one candy, he should take the candy with the highest tastiness, which is `n`.

2. **Verifying Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, `k = 1`: The output should be `1`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2`, `k = 1`: The output should be `2`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, `k = 3`: The maximum xor-sum of `1, 2, 3, 4` can be achieved with `1, 2, 4` giving `1 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 7`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 6`, `k = 6`: The maximum xor-sum here can be achieved by taking all candies, yielding `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 7`, which is also correct.

### Testing Further Cases

Let's consider larger values of `n` and `k`:
- For `n = 8`, `k = 3`: The possible XOR sums would be calculated from combinations of three candies. The maximum XOR-sum possible is `1 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 7`, which is less than `n` but valid.
- For `n = 8`, `k = 5`: Here, we can take `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, with a maximum XOR-sum of `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 5 = 7`, which aligns with the output of the program.

### Conclusion
The program appears to correctly handle the given task. The logic for calculating the maximum xor-sum based on the number of bits in `n` and considering the constraint on `k` is valid. Additionally, it covers edge cases where `k` equals `1`.

Therefore, I cannot find any specific case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
