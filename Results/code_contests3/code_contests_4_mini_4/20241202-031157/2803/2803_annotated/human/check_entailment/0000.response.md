To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the provided code.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Grisha has `n` candies, each with a unique tastiness from 1 to `n`.
2. Grisha can take at most `k` candies.
3. The goal is to maximize the xor-sum of the chosen candies.
4. The output should be the largest possible xor-sum.

### Key Observations:
- The xor-sum of all candies from 1 to `n` is maximized when we can select as many bits as possible from the binary representation of `n`.
- The maximum possible xor-sum that can be obtained from taking any subset of candies is `2^m - 1`, where `m` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` (this corresponds to taking all candies from `1` to `2^m - 1`).
- However, if `k` is less than `n`, then the maximum xor-sum achievable would depend on the specific candies selected.

### Code Explanation:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```
- The function reads integers `n` and `k`.
- If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`. This computes the maximum possible xor-sum when `k` allows for multiple selections.
- If `k` equals 1, it simply returns `n`, which does not correspond to maximizing the xor-sum when `k` is 1.

### Analysis:
- The expression `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` represents the largest xor-sum obtainable by selecting all bits (which is correct when `k` allows for it).
- However, if `k` is 1, the program defaults to returning `n`, which does not account for the fact that the maximum xor-sum should be derived from the single best candy, which is `1` (as the xor-sum of a single value is the value itself).

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `k` equals 1 correctly. For example:
- If `n = 4` and `k = 1`, the best xor-sum is `1`, but the program returns `4`.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements set out in the problem description for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
