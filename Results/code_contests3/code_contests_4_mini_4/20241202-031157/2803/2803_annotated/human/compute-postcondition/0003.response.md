Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates and prints `2` raised to the power of the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`, minus 1. If `k` equals 1, it simply prints the value of `n`. This functionality handles the given constraints of `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. **
