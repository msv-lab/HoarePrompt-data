The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it operates with two integer constraints: `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function is expected to perform some calculations or operations based on these constraints.

Given the lack of specific output cases, we can summarize that the function presumably returns a value based on the relationships between `n` and `k`. The exact nature of the output is not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, but it operates under the constraints of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is based on operations involving these integers, though the specifics of the output are not detailed.**
