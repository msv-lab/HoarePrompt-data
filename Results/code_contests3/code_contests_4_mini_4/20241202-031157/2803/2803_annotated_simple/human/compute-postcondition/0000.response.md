The code assigns values to `n` and `k` using the values obtained from the input. The `raw_input()` function will accept a string input, which is then split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers, and their values are updated based on the input.

Since `n` and `k` are integers and the input will provide specific values for them, we can determine that the new values of `n` and `k` are based on the input provided but are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that their values will be updated.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values from input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
