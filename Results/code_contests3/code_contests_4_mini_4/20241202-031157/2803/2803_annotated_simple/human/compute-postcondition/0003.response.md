Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It computes and prints `n` if `k` is 1; otherwise, it calculates and prints `2` raised to the power of the length of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix) minus 1. This effectively returns the maximum number of distinct non-zero values that can be formed from the bits of `n`, while also handling the special case when `k` equals 1.**
