The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `k` based on user input. The values of `n` and `k` are taken from the input and converted to integers. As such, the previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten with the new input values. The constraints state that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, but the specific values of `n` and `k` are not known from the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `k` are now assigned new integer values based on input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new integer values based on input.**
