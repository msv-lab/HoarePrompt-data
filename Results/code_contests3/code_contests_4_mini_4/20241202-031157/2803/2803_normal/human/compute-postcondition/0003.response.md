Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It prints `n` if `k` is equal to 1; otherwise, it prints `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, which is the maximum value representable with the number of bits in `n` minus one. This handles cases where `k` is 1 and where `k` is greater than 1 distinctly. **
