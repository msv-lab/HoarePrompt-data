The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, computes their sum `c`, and returns `c` decremented by `mod` if `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`. If `c` is less than `mod`, it returns `c` unchanged. The function does not handle any edge cases related to the parameters being out of bounds since it assumes valid input within the specified ranges.
