The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without any input arguments. However, it relies on two external constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer, and `K`, which is a non-negative integer. Additionally, it utilizes a list `H` containing `N` positive integers, where each element in the list adheres to specified limits.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot ascertain specific return values or behaviors without further details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates using external variables N, K, and a list H. The specific return value and behavior of the function are not provided.**
