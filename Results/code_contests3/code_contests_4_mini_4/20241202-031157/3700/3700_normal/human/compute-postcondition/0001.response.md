The code snippet takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and then calculates the sum of these integers. The variable `s` will be assigned this sum. However, the previous values of `H` and `N` are not directly affected in this code execution, as `H` is derived from a different input.

Since the input values for `s` are not specified, the output state will reflect that `s` is the sum of the user input integers. 

Output State: **`H` is a list of integers derived from the input, `N` is the number of elements in `H`; `s` is the sum of the integers from user input.**
