Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers derived from the input, `N` is the number of elements in `H`, and `s` is the sum of the integers from user input. If `s` is greater than or equal to the list `H`, 'Yes' is printed. If `s` is less than the minimum value of `H` (if `H` is not empty) or if `H` is an empty list, 'No' is printed.***
