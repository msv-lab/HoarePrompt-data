The function `func_2` does not take any parameters directly but relies on external input. It reads two lines of input: the first line is expected to contain a single integer `H`, and the second line contains `N` integers which are summed to get the value `s`. The functionality of the function checks if the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `H` and prints 'Yes' if it is, or 'No' if it is not.

However, the annotations suggest that `H` is a list, while the code treats `H` as a single integer. Additionally, the code does not handle cases where no input is provided or when the input values are outside the expected range. The function also does not account for cases where the sum of integers could be less than the minimum of a supposed list `H`, which is not utilized correctly in the code.

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `H` and a list of integers, sums the list, and prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to `H`, and 'No' otherwise. It does not handle cases of empty input or incorrect input types. **
