#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N), b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of special moves (K), and there is a list of integers representing the health of each monster (H_i) such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each monster, with a total of N health values.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N), `b` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of special moves (K), and `c` is a non-negative integer. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is updated to `a + b - mod`, and remains non-negative.
    return c
    #The program returns the non-negative integer c, which may have been updated to a + b - mod if c was greater than or equal to mod.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum `c`, and returns `c`. If the sum `c` is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it returns `c - mod` instead. The function does not account for the health of monsters or any conditions related to them, and it assumes `mod` is defined elsewhere in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers representing the health of N monsters where each health value H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers representing the health of N monsters; `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user. If `s` is greater than or equal to the health values in `H`, the program outputs 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the health values in `H`, the program outputs 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` representing the number of monsters and calculates the sum of a list of integers input by the user. It checks if this sum is greater than or equal to a specified health value `H`. If the sum is sufficient to match or exceed `H`, the function outputs 'Yes'; otherwise, it outputs 'No'. However, the function does not actually take `K` or `H` as parameters in the code, and it relies on user input for both `H` and the health values of the monsters, which may not align with the annotations. The function should also handle cases where the sum is computed from an empty input, leading to potential misinterpretation of the health comparison.
