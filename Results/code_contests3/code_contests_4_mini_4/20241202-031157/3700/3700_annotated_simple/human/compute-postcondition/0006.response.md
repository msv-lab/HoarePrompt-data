Postcondition: ***`H` is a list of integers representing the health of N monsters; `s` is the sum of the integers entered by the user. If `s` is greater than or equal to the health values in `H`, the program outputs 'Yes'. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the health values in `H`, the program outputs 'No'.***
