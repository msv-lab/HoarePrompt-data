The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `H`. Here are the details about each parameter:

1. `N` is an integer that represents the number of monsters, and it must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq N \leq 200000\).
2. `K` is a non-negative integer that could indicate some form of action limit or threshold, with the constraint \(0 \leq K \leq 200000\).
3. `H` is a list of integers that contains the health values of the monsters, where each health value `H_i` satisfies \(1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9\).

The function processes these inputs and returns an output based on the parameters. However, the output specifics were not provided in the prompt, so I cannot detail that aspect.
