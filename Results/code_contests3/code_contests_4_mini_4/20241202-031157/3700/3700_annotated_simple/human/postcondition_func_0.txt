The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum `c`, and returns `c`. If the sum `c` is greater than or equal to a variable `mod`, it returns `c - mod` instead. The function does not account for the health of monsters or any conditions related to them, and it assumes `mod` is defined elsewhere in the code.
