The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns this value adjusted by `mod` if it is greater than or equal to `mod`, ensuring that the result remains non-negative. If the sum is less than `mod`, it returns the sum directly. The function does not perform any checks for the values of `a` and `b` being within specified bounds, but it assumes they are valid as per the input constraints.
