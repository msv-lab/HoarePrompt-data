Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer N and a list of N integers H from user input, calculates the sum of another set of integers from user input, and prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. However, the code does not properly handle the comparison since H is treated as a list, and the comparison should be with a single value. This results in incorrect behavior if H contains multiple values.**
