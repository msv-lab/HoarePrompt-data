The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `H`. `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and `H` is a list of `N` integers where each `H[i]` satisfies 1 <= H[i] <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the function will return a specific output based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (integer), K (non-negative integer), and H (list of N integers) and returns a value based on the logic defined in the function body.**
