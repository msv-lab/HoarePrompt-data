#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (1 ≤ a ≤ 200,000), b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves Fennec can use (0 ≤ b ≤ 200,000), and the health of each monster is represented by a list of integers where each health value is between 1 and 1,000,000,000 (1 ≤ H_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters, `b` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves Fennec can use, and `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod` and remains non-negative.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of c, which is the sum of a and b, potentially adjusted by mod if it is greater than or equal to mod, ensuring it remains non-negative.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, calculates their sum, and returns this value adjusted by `mod` if it is greater than or equal to `mod`, ensuring that the result remains non-negative. If the sum is less than `mod`, it returns the sum directly. The function does not perform any checks for the values of `a` and `b` being within specified bounds, but it assumes they are valid as per the input constraints.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of N integers where each H[i] satisfies 1 <= H[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers from input, `N` is the first integer from input, and `s` is the sum of the integers entered in the input. If the sum `s` is greater than or equal to the list `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the value of `H`, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer N and a list of N integers H from user input, calculates the sum of another set of integers from user input, and prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. However, the code does not properly handle the comparison since H is treated as a list, and the comparison should be with a single value. This results in incorrect behavior if H contains multiple values.
