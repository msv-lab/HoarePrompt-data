The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description.

1. The function `func_2` is attempting to read input values for `N` and `K`, but it is not using them correctly to calculate the minimum number of attacks required. Instead, it simply checks if the sum of the monster healths is greater than or equal to `K`, which is irrelevant to the problem statement.

2. The program does not account for the scenario where Fennec can use the Special Move `K` times effectively to minimize the number of attacks required. It fails to implement any logic that calculates the total number of attacks needed after considering the Special Moves.

3. The program also contains a faulty logic where it checks if the total health is greater than `H`, which does not relate to the problem at hand. The problem centers around minimizing attacksâ€”not simply summing health values.

Given these points, I can provide a specific case where the program does not work as expected:

**Example Case:**
Input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
Expected output:
```
5
```
The program will not handle this correctly because it does not calculate the attacks needed after utilizing the special move.

Correctness: **False**.
