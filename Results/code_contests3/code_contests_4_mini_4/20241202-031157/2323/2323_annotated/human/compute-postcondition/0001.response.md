`b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input string representing a positive integer. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer converted from a string.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer converted from a string.**
