The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `copya`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 1, `copya` is the result of integer division of the original value of `copya` by 10**
