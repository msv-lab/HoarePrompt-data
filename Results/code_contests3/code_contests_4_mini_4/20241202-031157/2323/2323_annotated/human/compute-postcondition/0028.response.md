The variable `a` is assigned the value of `a // 10`, which means it is performing an integer division of `a` by 10. However, `a` is currently undefined, so this operation cannot be performed. The other variables `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, but `a` remains undefined due to the division operation.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, but `a` remains undefined due to the division operation.**
