`copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is a positive integer, and this assignment does not affect the values of `b` or `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 0, `copya` is a positive integer (the same value as `a`).

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 0, `copya` is a positive integer**
