Postcondition: ***`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, then `h` is a non-zero value obtained from `a % 10`, `a` is updated to 10, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `10 % b`. Otherwise, if `a % 10` is equal to 0, then `h` is 0 and `a` remains unchanged.***
