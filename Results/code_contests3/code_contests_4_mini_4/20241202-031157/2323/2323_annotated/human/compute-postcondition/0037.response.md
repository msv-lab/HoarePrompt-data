The operation `a //= 10` attempts to perform an integer floor division of `a` by 10 and assign the result back to `a`. However, since `a` is undefined due to its absence, this operation will not change any variable state. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unaffected as well.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `h` is undefined due to the absence of `a`.**
