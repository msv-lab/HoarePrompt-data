The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `copya` must have been at least 10 for the loop to execute again, this operation will reduce `copya` to at least 1. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 1, and `copya` is now equal to `copya // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 1, and `copya` is now equal to `copya // 10**
