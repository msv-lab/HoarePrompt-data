The code attempts to assign a value to `a` using the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. However, since `a` is undefined at the time of execution, this will result in an error. The values of the other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`) do not change due to the error. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `a`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and an error occurs due to the undefined variable `a.**
