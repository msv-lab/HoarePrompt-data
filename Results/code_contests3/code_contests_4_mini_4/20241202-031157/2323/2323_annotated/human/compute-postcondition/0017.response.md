The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is not a multiple of 10, `a % 10` will yield a non-zero result. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is not a multiple of 10, and `h` is assigned a non-zero value from `a % 10`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is not a multiple of 10, and `h` is assigned a non-zero value from `a % 10.**
