The function `func` accepts two parameters: a string representing a positive integer and an integer `m`. The string must be of length between 2 and 200,000 digits and cannot have leading zeros. The integer `m` must be in the range of 2 to 10^8. After executing the function body, it processes these inputs according to its internal logic and returns a result based on them.
