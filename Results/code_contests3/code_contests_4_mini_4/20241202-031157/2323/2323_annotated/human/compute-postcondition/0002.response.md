The variable `c` is assigned the value of `0`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 0**
