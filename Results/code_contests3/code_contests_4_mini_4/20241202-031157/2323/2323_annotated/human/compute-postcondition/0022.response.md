`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a % 10` is equal to 0 (as stated in the initial state), `h` will be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a value such that `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a value such that `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` is 0**
