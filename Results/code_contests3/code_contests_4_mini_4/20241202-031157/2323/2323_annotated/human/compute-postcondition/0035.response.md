According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `c`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `c` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, it will become 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `c` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 2**
