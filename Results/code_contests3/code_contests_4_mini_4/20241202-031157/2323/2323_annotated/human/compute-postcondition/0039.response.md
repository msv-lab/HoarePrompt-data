The code attempts to assign the value of `ans` to be the minimum of `ans` and `a % b`. However, since `a` is undefined due to an error in its assignment, this will lead to an error when trying to compute `a % b`. Consequently, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and there is an error due to `a` being undefined.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and there is an error due to `a` being undefined.**
