`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 2, so after the execution, `c` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 3, and `copya` is reduced to one-tenth of its previous value.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 3, and `copya` is reduced to one-tenth of its previous value.**
