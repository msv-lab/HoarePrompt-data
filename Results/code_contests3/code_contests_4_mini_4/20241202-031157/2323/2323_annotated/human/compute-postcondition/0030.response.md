`ans` is assigned the value of `min(ans, a % b)`. However, since `a` is undefined, we cannot determine the value of `a % b`, and thus the expression cannot be evaluated. Other variables `copya`, `c`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a` remains undefined. 

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a` remains undefined.**
