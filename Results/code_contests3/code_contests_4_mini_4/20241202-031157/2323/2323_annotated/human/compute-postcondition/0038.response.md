The variable `a` is assigned the value `10 ** c * h + a`. However, `h` is undefined, which leads to an error when trying to compute `10 ** c * h`. Since `c` is greater than 1, `10 ** c` computes to a positive number, but the multiplication with `h` (which is undefined) will cause a failure in execution. 

The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged as a result of this. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `h` is undefined, which causes an error in the assignment of `a`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `h` is undefined, and there is an error in the assignment of `a`.**
