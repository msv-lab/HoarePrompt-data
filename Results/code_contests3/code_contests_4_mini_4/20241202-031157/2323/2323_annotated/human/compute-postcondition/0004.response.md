According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is not zero (i.e., it's truthy). Right before the loop, `copya` is a positive integer, which means that it is guaranteed to be greater than zero. Therefore, the loop can execute one time without needing any adjustments.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 0, `copya` is a positive integer**
