The value of `copya` is assigned the result of `copya //= 10`, which means it is divided by 10 using floor division. The value of `copya` is not given in the initial state but must be greater than or equal to 10 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, after this operation, `copya` will be reduced to a smaller integer, specifically one-tenth of its previous value. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 2, and `copya` is reduced to one-tenth of its previous value.**
