Functionality: ** The function accepts a string representing a positive integer `a` (with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits) and an integer `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8). It calculates the minimum value of `a % b` after potentially rearranging the digits of `a` (by moving the last non-zero digit to the front) and considers various configurations of `a` while iterating through its digits. The final result, which is printed, is the minimum modulo value found. The function does not handle invalid inputs or leading zeros as per the constraints provided. **
