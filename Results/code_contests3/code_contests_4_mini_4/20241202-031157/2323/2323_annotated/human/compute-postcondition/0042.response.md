The code assigns a new value to `a` based on the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. The variables involved are `c`, `h`, and `a`. 

- `c` is greater than 1, so let's denote `c` as some integer greater than 1 (e.g., 2).
- `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, and since the value of `a` is not provided, we cannot determine `h` explicitly.
- `a` is then divided by 10, but since we don't know the initial value of `a`, we cannot quantify this operation.
- The expression `10 ** c * h + a` calculates a new value for `a`, where `10 ** c` represents a power of 10 and `h` is the last digit of the previous `a`.

Thus, we cannot determine exact values for `h` or the new `a` without knowing the initial value of `a`. Therefore, we state that `a` is updated based on the expression involving `c` and `h`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `a` is updated based on `10 ** c * h + a`.**
