The operation `a //= 10` performs floor division of `a` by 10 and assigns the result back to `a`. Since `a` is not a multiple of 10, this operation will reduce the value of `a` to its integer division by 10, effectively removing the last digit. The other variables `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is reduced to `a // 10`, and `h` is assigned a non-zero value from `a % 10.**
