According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0 (i.e., it is truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is the result of integer division of the original value of `copya` by 10. This means that `copya` has been reduced, and for the loop to execute one more time, the original value of `copya` must have been at least 10 (to ensure it was greater than 0 before being divided). 

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the original value of `copya` must have been greater than or equal to 10, so that after division, `copya` is still greater than 0. 

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 1, for the loop to execute again the original value of `copya` must have been at least 10**
