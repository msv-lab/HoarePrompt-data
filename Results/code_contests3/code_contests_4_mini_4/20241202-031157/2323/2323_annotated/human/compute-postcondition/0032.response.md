The variable `a` is being modified with the operation `a //= 10`, which performs integer division of `a` by 10. However, since `a` is undefined in the initial state, attempting to execute this operation will lead to an error. Therefore, the values of the other variables do not change. The output state reflects this situation.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `h` is undefined due to the absence of `a`. An error occurs due to the undefined variable `a`.**
