`a` is assigned the value of `a // 10`, which means `a` is divided by 10 using floor division. The initial condition states that `a` is such that `a % 10` is equal to 0, implying that `a` is a multiple of 10. The specific new value of `a` will depend on its initial value, which is not provided, but `a` will be reduced to a value that is 10 times smaller. The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is reduced to `a // 10`, `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is reduced to `a // 10`, `h` is 0**
