According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `c` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute one more time. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `c`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `c` must be greater than 1.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
