The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Initially, `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `copya`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 2, and `copya` is equal to `copya // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 2, and `copya` is equal to `copya // 10**
