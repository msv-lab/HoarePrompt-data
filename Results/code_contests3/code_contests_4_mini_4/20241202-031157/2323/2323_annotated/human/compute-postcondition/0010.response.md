According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` has been modified to `copya // 10`. Since `copya` is being divided by 10, for the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must have been greater than or equal to 10 before this operation. Therefore, `copya` should be adjusted to be at least 10 before the division.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `copya` is greater than or equal to 10**
