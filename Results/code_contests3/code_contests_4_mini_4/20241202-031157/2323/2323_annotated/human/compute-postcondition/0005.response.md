The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `copya` is a positive integer, the result of `copya //= 10` will be the integer part of `copya` divided by 10. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the changed value of `copya` after the operation.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer converted from a string, `c` is 0, `copya` is the result of integer division of the original value of `copya` by 10**
