`copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is an input integer, so `copya` will hold that same integer value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same as `a`.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a string of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is the same as `a`**.
