Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs, `a` and `b`, where `a` is expected to be a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, and `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^8. It calculates the minimum value of `a % b` after potentially rotating the digits of `a` if the last digit is non-zero. The function outputs this minimum value. If all last digits are zero, it does not change the value of `a` and will only return the original `a % b`. **
