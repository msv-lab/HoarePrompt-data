`a` is assigned the value of `a // 10`. Since `a` is 10, the result of `10 // 10` is 1. The other variables `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, and `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, and `a` is 1**
