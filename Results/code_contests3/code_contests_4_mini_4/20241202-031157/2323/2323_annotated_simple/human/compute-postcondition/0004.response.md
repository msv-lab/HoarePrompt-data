According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `copya` is non-zero (truthy). Right before the loop, `copya` is stated to be the same as `a`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be non-zero. If `a` is 0, then `copya` would also be 0, and the loop would not execute at all.

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute, `a` needs to be adjusted to any integer value other than 0. 

State: **Stepan's integer is a string of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, for the loop to execute the first time `a` must be non-zero.**
