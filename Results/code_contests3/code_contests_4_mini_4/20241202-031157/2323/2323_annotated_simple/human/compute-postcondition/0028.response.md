`a` is assigned the value of `a // 10`, which is `10 // 10`. This results in `a` being updated to `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
