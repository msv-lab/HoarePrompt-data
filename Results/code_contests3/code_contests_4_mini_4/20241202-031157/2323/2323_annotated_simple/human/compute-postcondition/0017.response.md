The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. The value of `a % 10` is not specified directly in the initial state, but we know that `a % 10` is not equal to 0. The other variables (`copya`, `c`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is assigned a value that is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is assigned a value that is not equal to 0.**
