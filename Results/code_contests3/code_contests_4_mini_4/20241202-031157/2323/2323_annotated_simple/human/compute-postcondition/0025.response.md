Postcondition: ***`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, if `a % 10` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is not equal to 0, and `a` is 10. Otherwise, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is 0, and `a` remains unchanged.***
