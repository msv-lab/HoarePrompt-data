The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `copya` is greater than or equal to 10, the result of `copya //= 10` will be a value that is at least 1. The exact new value of `copya` is unknown because it depends on its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `copya` is now less than or equal to its previous value divided by 10, and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `copya` is now less than or equal to its previous value divided by 10, `c` is increased by 1.**
