The value of `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since the last digit of `a` is 0, `a % 10` will also result in 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is 0**
