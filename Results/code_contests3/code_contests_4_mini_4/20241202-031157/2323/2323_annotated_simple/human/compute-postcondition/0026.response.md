According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `c` is greater than 0, it means the loop can execute at least one more time. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be greater than 1.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is not equal to 0, and `a` is 10**
