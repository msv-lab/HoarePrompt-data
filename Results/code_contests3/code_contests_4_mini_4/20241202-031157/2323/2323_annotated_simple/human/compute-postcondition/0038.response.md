In the given code snippet, `a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. 

- The previous value of `a` is 1.
- `c` is greater than 2, so letâ€™s denote `c` as some value greater than 2 (e.g., 3).
- `h` is 0.

Now, let's calculate the new value of `a`:

1. Calculate `10 ** c`: if we assume `c` is 3, then `10 ** 3` is 1000.
2. Calculate `10 ** c * h`: since `h` is 0, this results in `1000 * 0 = 0`.
3. Add this to the previous value of `a`: `0 + 1 = 1`.

However, since we do not know the exact value of `c` (only that it is greater than 2), we can say that `10 ** c * h` will always be 0 because `h` is 0, thus `a` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.**
