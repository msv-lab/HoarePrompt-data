`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is 10, the calculation gives `h = 10 % 10`, which results in `h` being 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, and `a` is 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, and `a` is 10**
