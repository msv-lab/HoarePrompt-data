According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` has been reduced by a factor of 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must still be non-zero. This means it should be greater than or equal to 1 after the reduction. 

Since `copya` is reduced by 10, it must have been greater than or equal to 10 before the last iteration for it to be non-zero now.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits, `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `copya` is greater than or equal to 10, `c` is increased by 1**
