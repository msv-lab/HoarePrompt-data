Given the initial state `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1, we analyze the code snippet:

```
a = 10 ** c * h + a
```

1. The variable `h` is 0, so `10 ** c * h` will be `10 ** c * 0`, which equals 0 regardless of the value of `c`.
2. Therefore, the calculation simplifies to `a = 0 + a`, which means that `a` retains its original value of 1.

As a result, the variable `a` remains unchanged at 1, and the other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`, `h`) are not affected by this operation.

Thus, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
