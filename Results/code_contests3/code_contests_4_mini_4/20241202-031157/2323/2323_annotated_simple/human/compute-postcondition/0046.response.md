The function `func` accepts a parameter `stepan`, which is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `m`, which is an integer between 2 and 10^8. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the prompt, so we cannot determine the specific return values or cases based on the provided constraints and relationships. Therefore, we can conclude the parameters accepted by the function based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `stepan`, which is a string of digits (length between 2 and 200,000), and a parameter `m`, which is an integer between 2 and 10^8.**
