The value of `h` is assigned the result of `a % 10`. Given that `a` is 10, the calculation results in `h = 10 % 10`, which equals 0. The values of the other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, and `a` is 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 10**
