The variable `a` is assigned the value of `a //= 10`, which means `a` is updated to the result of integer division of `a` by 10. Since the initial value of `a` is 10, this results in `a` becoming 1 (10 divided by 10 equals 1). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, and `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
