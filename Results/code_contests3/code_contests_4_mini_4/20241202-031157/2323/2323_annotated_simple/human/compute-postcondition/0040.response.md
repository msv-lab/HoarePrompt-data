`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that `a` is 10, we calculate `10 % 10`, which results in `0`. Therefore, the value of `h` is updated to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The output state is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, and `a` is 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 10**
