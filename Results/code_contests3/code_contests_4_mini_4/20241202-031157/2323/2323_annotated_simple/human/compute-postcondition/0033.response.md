The value of `a` is updated with the formula `10 ** c * h + a`. Given that `c` is greater than 1, `h` is 0, and `a` is initially 1, we can substitute these values into the equation:

1. Calculate `10 ** c`: Since `c` is greater than 1, `10 ** c` is a positive number greater than 10.
2. Calculate `10 ** c * h`: Since `h` is 0, this product will be 0 regardless of the value of `10 ** c`.
3. Finally, `a` is updated as `0 + 1`, which results in `a` remaining 1.

The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
