`a` is assigned the value of `a // 10`. The current value of `a` is 10, so after executing this operation, `a` becomes 1 (since 10 // 10 is 1). The states of the other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
