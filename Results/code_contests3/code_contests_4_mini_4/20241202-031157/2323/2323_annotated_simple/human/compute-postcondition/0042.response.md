`a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. The value of `c` is greater than 2 and `h` is 0. Therefore, `10 ** c` will be a large number, but when multiplied by `h` (which is 0), the result is 0. So, the new value of `a` will be `0 + 1`, which equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
