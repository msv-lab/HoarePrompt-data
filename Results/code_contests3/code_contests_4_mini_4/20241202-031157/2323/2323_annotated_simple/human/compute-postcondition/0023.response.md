`a` is divided by 10 using integer division, but the initial value of `a` is not provided. Since `c` is greater than 0 and `copya` is 0, we do not have any further information on how to determine the new value of `a`. Therefore, the output state is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is 0 and `a` is modified by integer division by 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is 0 and `a` is modified by integer division by 10.**
