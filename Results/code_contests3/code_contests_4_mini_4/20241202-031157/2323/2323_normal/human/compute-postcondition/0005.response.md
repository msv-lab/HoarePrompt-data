The value of `copya` is assigned the result of `copya //= 10`, which means `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since it is specified that `copya` is equal to `a` and `a` is greater than 0, we need to consider the effect of this operation. The exact value of `copya` after this operation will depend on the value of `a`, but it will be reduced to `a // 10`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; a is greater than 0; b is an input integer; c is 0; copya is equal to a // 10`.
