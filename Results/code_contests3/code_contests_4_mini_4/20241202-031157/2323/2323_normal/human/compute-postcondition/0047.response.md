Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a large integer represented as a string of digits and `b` is an integer (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8). It calculates the minimum remainder of all rearrangements of the digits of `a` when divided by `b` and prints this minimum remainder. It does not check if `a` is divisible by `m` nor does it return "Yes" or "No" based on divisibility. **
