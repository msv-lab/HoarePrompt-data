Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; if `a` is not divisible by 10, then `a` is updated to 10; `h` is the last digit of the initial `a`; `copya` is set to 0; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b`; `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `c` must be greater than 1; `h` is `a % 10` which gives the last digit of `a`.**
