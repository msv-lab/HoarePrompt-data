The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `a // 10`. Since `copya` is being updated with the operation `copya //= 10`, it will now hold the value of `copya` divided by 10, discarding any remainder. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, if `copya` was previously equal to `a // 10`, after this operation, it will be equal to `(a // 10) // 10`. 

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; a is greater than or equal to 10; b is an input integer; c is 1; copya is equal to (a // 10) // 10**
