Postcondition: ***`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; if `a` is not divisible by 10, then `a` is updated to 10, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, `c` is decreased by 1, `copya` is set to 0, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is 0.***
