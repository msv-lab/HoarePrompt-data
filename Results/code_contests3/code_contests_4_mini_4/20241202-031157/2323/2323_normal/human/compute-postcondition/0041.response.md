The statement `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The variable `h` represents the last digit of `a` before this operation, calculated as `a % 10`. After the operation, `a` is updated, but `h` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, and `a` is now reduced by one digit (i.e., `a` becomes `a // 10`).

Output State: **`h` is the last digit of the original `a`, `a` is now reduced by one digit**
