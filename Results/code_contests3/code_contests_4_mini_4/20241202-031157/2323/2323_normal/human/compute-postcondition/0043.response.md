Postcondition: ***`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8. If `a` is not divisible by 10, then `a` is updated to 10 and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` for an unknown value of `b`. Otherwise, `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, and `a` is adjusted to its original value plus 10.***
