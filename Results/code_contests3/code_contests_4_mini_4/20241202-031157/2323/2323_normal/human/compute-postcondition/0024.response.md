The variable `a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. The previous value of `h` is 0, and since `c` is one less than before, we can be sure `10 ** c` is a power of 10 based on the number of digits in `a`. Therefore, the new value of `a` will be equal to `10 ** c * 0 + a`, which simplifies to just `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged because this operation only affects `a`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is unchanged; `b` is an input integer; `c` is now one less than before; `copya` is 0; `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`; `i` is 0; `h` is 0.**
