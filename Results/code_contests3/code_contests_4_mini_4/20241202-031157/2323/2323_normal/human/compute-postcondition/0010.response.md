According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue executing as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to (a // 10) // 10. Since `a` is greater than or equal to 10, this means that `copya` could be greater than or equal to 1, depending on the value of `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must still be greater than zero. 

Since we do not have the specific value of `a`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `copya` must be greater than zero, which implies that `a` must be at least 100 (because (a // 10) // 10 must be greater than or equal to 1).

State: **Stepan's integer is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; and for the loop to execute again, `a` must be at least 100, so `copya` is greater than 0.**
