According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `copya` is equal to `a` (which is an input integer). For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be non-zero. Since `a` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0.

State: **`Stepan's integer is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; m is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; a is greater than 0; b is an input integer; c is 0; copya is equal to a**
