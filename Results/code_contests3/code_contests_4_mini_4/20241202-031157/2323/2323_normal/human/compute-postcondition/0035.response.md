According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be greater than 1, and `i` must be updated to 2.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; if `a` is not divisible by 10, then `a` is updated to 10, `h` is the last digit of the initial `a`, `copya` is set to 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b`, `i` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `c` must be greater than 1.**
