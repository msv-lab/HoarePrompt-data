The function `func` accepts a parameter `stepan` which is a string representing an integer. This string has a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros. It also accepts a parameter `m`, which is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq m \leq 10^8\). 

The function's output is determined by the following cases:
- Case_1: If the integer represented by `stepan` is divisible by `m`, the function returns "Yes".
- Case_2: If the integer represented by `stepan` is not divisible by `m`, the function returns "No".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `stepan` representing a large integer and an integer `m`, and determine if the integer represented by `stepan` is divisible by `m`, returning "Yes" if it is and "No" if it is not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `stepan` representing a large integer and an integer `m`, returning "Yes" if `stepan` is divisible by `m`, and "No" if it is not.**
