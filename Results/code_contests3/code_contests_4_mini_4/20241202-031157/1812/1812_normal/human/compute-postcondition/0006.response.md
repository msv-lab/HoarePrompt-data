Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `N` is the integer value of `s` without the last character, `C` is the difference between the ASCII value of the last character of `S` and the ASCII value of 'a'; `M` is assigned the value of `N - 1 & 3`; `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is decreased by `M`, resulting in `N` being either the original value minus 1 or the original value minus 2.**
