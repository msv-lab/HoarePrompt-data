Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing a row number and a character `s` ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f') representing a seat in that row. It computes a value based on `n` and `s` using specific calculations involving the ASCII value of `s` and bitwise operations on `n`. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the computed result directly. **
