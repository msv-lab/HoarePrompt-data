The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the row number, constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The parameter `s` is a character that represents the seat in that row, and it can be one of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'. After executing the function body, it returns a value based on the provided inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and a character `s` ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f') representing the seat in that row. It returns a value based on the provided `n` and `s`.**
