Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'); `S` is the string input after stripping whitespace; if `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is either the original value plus 1 or the original value plus 2, and `C` is `ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'); `M` being in (1, 2) indicates that `M` has been toggled between 1 and 2.***
