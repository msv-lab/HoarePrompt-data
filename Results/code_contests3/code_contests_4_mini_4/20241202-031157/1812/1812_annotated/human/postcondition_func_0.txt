The function accepts a positive integer `n` (representing the row number) and a character `s` (representing the seat in that row). It processes the input to compute a specific output based on the row number and seat character, which is calculated using the formula involving `N` and `C`. The function does not return any value; it directly prints the computed result. The logic accounts for specific cases based on the row number, but does not handle potential invalid input scenarios or constraints outside the provided expectations.
