The operation `M ^= 3` is a bitwise XOR operation on `M`. The value of `M` can be either 1 or 2.

1. If `M` is 1:
   - The binary representation of 1 is `01`.
   - The binary representation of 3 is `11`.
   - Performing XOR: 
     ```
     01
     11
     ----
     10  (which is 2 in decimal)
     ```
   - So, if `M` was 1, it now becomes 2.

2. If `M` is 2:
   - The binary representation of 2 is `10`.
   - Performing XOR:
     ```
     10
     11
     ----
     01  (which is 1 in decimal)
     ```
   - So, if `M` was 2, it now becomes 1.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `M` is now either 1 or 2, depending on its initial value. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is a character representing a seat; `N` is either the previous value of `N - 1` or `N - 2`; `C` is the integer value of the difference between the ASCII values of the last character of `s` and 'a'; `M` is either 1 or 2.**
