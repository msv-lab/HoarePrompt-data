Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is a character representing a seat; if `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is updated to either `N + 1` or `N + 2`, and `C` remains the integer value of the difference between the ASCII values of the last character of `s` and 'a'.***
