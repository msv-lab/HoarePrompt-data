The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and a character `s` representing a seat ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'). It calculates a specific value based on the input `n` and the position of `s` in the alphabet, adjusting `n` if needed, and prints the computed result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
