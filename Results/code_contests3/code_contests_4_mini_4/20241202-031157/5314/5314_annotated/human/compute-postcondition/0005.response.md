The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The other variables `n`, `t`, `ai`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), `ai` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), `a` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input, `i` is 1; `t` is decremented by the value `86400 - int(a[0])`.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), `ai` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), `a` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input, `i` is 1; `t` is decremented by the value `86400 - int(a[0])**
