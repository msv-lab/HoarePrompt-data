The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[i])) and variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100); `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[i])) and variable `i` is increased by 1.**
