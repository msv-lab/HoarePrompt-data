The variables `n` and `t` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into a list of strings, which are then converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `t` are replaced by the new input values. The list `ai` remains unaffected in this operation, as it does not interact with the assignment of `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and `ai` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400).**
