The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it utilizes the constraints provided: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400). 

The function processes these inputs and returns the result based on these constraints. The exact output is not specified in the provided details, but it is clear that the function is designed to handle the parameters within the specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list of n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), and returns a result based on these inputs.**
