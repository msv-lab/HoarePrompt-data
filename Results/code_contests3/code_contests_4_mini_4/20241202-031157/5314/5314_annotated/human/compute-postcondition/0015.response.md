Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400). It calculates how many full days Luba can work given the total available time `t`, and prints the number of days (represented by `i`) it takes until the time `t` is no longer sufficient to cover the remaining work time. The function does not return a value but prints the result. If `t` is exhausted before all days are accounted for, `i` will equal `n`, indicating that all available days were processed.**
