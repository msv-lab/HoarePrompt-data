The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and since `i` was initially 1, its new value becomes 2. The other variables `n`, `t`, `ai`, and `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`, `ai` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`, `ai` is a list of n integers, `a` is a list of strings, `i` is 2**
