The code executes a print statement that outputs the value of `i`. The value of `i` is previously assigned as `n`, which is a new positive integer within the range of 1 to 100. The other variables (`t`, `ai`, `a`) are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n`**
