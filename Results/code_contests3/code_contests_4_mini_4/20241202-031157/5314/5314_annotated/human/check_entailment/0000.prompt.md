You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently Luba bought a very interesting book. She knows that it will take t seconds to read the book. Luba wants to finish reading as fast as she can.

But she has some work to do in each of n next days. The number of seconds that Luba has to spend working during i-th day is ai. If some free time remains, she can spend it on reading.

Help Luba to determine the minimum number of day when she finishes reading.

It is guaranteed that the answer doesn't exceed n.

Remember that there are 86400 seconds in a day.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ t ≤ 106) — the number of days and the time required to read the book.

The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400) — the time Luba has to spend on her work during i-th day.

Output

Print the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book.

It is guaranteed that answer doesn't exceed n.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and ai is a list of n integers where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400).
def func():
    n, t = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
    a = raw_input().split()
    i = 0
    while t > 0:
        t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a new positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is updated to `t - sum(86400 - int(a[j]) for j in range(n))`, `ai` is a list of n integers where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), `a` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input, `i` is `n`
    print(i)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list of `n` integers `a`, where each integer represents the time in seconds Luba has to spend on work during each day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400). It calculates how many full days Luba can work given the total available time `t`, and prints the number of days (represented by `i`) it takes until the time `t` is no longer sufficient to cover the remaining work time. The function does not return a value but prints the result. If `t` is exhausted before all days are accounted for, `i` will equal `n`, indicating that all available days were processed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
