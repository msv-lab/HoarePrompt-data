The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `ai`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of days, constrained between 1 and 100 (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).
- `t` is an integer representing the time required to read the book in seconds, constrained between 1 and 1,000,000 (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6).
- `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` represents the time Luba has to work on the i-th day, constrained between 0 and 86,400 (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400).

After executing the function body, the function returns the number of days Luba can allocate to reading the book based on the time available each day. The exact conditions for the return value are not specified in the output description provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `ai`, and returns the number of days Luba can spend reading the book based on the available time per day.**
