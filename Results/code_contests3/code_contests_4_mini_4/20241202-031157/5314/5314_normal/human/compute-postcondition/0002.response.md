The variable `i` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of days; `t` is an integer representing the time required to read the book in seconds; `a` is a list of strings from input; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of days; `t` is an integer representing the time required to read the book in seconds; `a` is a list of strings from input; `i` is 0**
