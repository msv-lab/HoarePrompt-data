According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer representing the time required to read the book in seconds. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to be a positive integer.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of days, `t` is a positive integer representing the time required to read the book in seconds, `a` is a list of strings from input, `i` is 0**
