Output State: **`t` is the remaining time after subtracting the total of `86400 - int(a[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, `i` is the total number of elements processed from list `a`, which is equal to the number of days (or until `t` becomes non-positive). If `t` is not enough for all days in `a`, `i` will be less than the length of `a`. If `t` was sufficient for all days, `i` will be equal to the length of `a`.**
