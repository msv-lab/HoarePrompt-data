The code `a = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it by whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `a`. The previous values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and `ai` is not affected directly by this operation. However, since `a` will now hold input values that could represent the `ai` list, the output state will reflect that `a` contains the input values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of days; `t` is an integer representing the time required to read the book in seconds; `a` is a list of strings from input.**
