Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of days and an integer `t` representing the total time required to read a book in seconds. It processes a list of integers `a`, where each value represents the time Luba has to work on each respective day. The function calculates how many days Luba can spend reading the book based on the available time each day by deducting the time worked from a full day (86400 seconds) until the total reading time `t` is exhausted or there are no more days left. It returns the number of days Luba can read before running out of time. If `t` is greater than the total available time across all days, the function will return `n`, indicating she can read for all days. **
