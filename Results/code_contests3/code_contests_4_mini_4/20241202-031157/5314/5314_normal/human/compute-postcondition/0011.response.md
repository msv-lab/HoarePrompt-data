The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of days; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[i]))`; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of days; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[i]))`; `i` is increased by 1**
