Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the number of days (n) is less than the required reading time (t). For example, if we have the following input:

```
1 1000000
0
```

In this case, Luba has 0 seconds available for reading on that day, and since the required reading time is 1,000,000 seconds, the output should indicate that she cannot finish reading the book in the given days. However, the program will just keep incrementing `i` without checking if `t` has become zero or negative, and will eventually result in an IndexError when it tries to access `a[i]` beyond its length.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not properly account for situations where reading the book is not possible within the given days.
