The code assigns values to `n` and `t` by accepting input, where the input is split into two integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is between 1 and 100 and `t` is between 1 and 1,000,000. Since the actual input values are not provided, we can only state that `n` and `t` will take on values based on user input. The list `ai` remains unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000, and `ai` is a list of n integers where each ai is between 0 and 86,400; `n` and `t` are assigned values from user input.**
