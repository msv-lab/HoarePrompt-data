The value of `t` is updated by subtracting `86400 - int(a[i])` from it. The specific value of `t` is not provided, but it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. The value of `a[i]` must also be specified as it affects the computation. However, since `n` is stated to be an integer between 1 and 100 and does not directly impact the calculation of `t`, it remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is updated based on the calculation involving `a[i]`, specifically `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is updated based on `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.**
