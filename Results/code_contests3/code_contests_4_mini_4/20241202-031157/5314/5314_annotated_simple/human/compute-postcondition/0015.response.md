Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 100) and `t` (between 1 and 1,000,000), along with a list of `n` integers (where each integer represents a value between 0 and 86,400). It calculates how many elements in the list can be processed before the total time `t` becomes less than or equal to 0 by subtracting the difference between 86,400 and each element in the list from `t`. The function then prints the number of elements processed before `t` is depleted, which can potentially be less than `n` if `t` reaches 0 before all elements are processed. **
