The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is updated based on `t - (86400 - int(a[0]))`; `a` is a list of strings; `i` is 1**
