The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is updated based on `t - (86400 - int(a[i])) and variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is updated based on `t - (86400 - int(a[i])); variable `i` is increased by 1**
