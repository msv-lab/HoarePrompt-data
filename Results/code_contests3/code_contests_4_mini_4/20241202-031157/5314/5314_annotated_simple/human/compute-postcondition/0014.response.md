The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n`, `t`, and `ai`. The parameter `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000, and `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each element `ai` is between 0 and 86,400. The output of the function is not explicitly specified in the provided details. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return values or conditions for returning those values based on the information given.
