The code `a = raw_input().split()` assigns `a` a list that consists of the input string split into separate components based on whitespace. The previous states of `n`, `t`, and `ai` remain unchanged, but `a` will now hold the input values as strings. The specific values of `n`, `t`, and `ai` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 1,000,000; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is between 0 and 86,400; `a` is a list of strings from user input.**
