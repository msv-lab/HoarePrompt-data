To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and consider potential edge cases.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads two integers `n` (number of days) and `t` (time needed to read the book).
2. It reads a list of integers `a` which represent the time Luba spends working each day.
3. The program uses a while loop to subtract the available reading time from `t` until `t` becomes less than or equal to 0.
4. For each day `i`, it calculates the available reading time as `86400 - int(a[i])` and subtracts this from `t`.
5. The loop increments `i` until Luba finishes reading the book, at which point it prints the day count `i`.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Case where `t` is exactly equal to the free time available on the first day:** 
  - Input: 
    ```
    1 86400
    0
    ```
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - The program will correctly calculate the free time as `86400` and finish reading on the first day.
  
- **Case where Luba has no time to read any day:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    2 86400
    86400 86400
    ```
  - Expected Output: No valid day (impossible to read).
  - The program will result in an infinite loop or an index error when trying to access `a[i]` since `i` will exceed the length of `a`.

- **Case where `t` is greater than the total time available in all days:**
  - Input:
    ```
    3 259200
    86400 86400 86400
    ```
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - The program will correctly calculate the available time each day and return `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where Luba has no time to read at all, leading to potential infinite loops or crashes due to index out-of-bounds errors. Since there is at least one input case where the program fails to meet the problem description requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
