Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is supposed to return the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, but instead, it attempts to check if a string (which it tries to derive from the input `n`) is a palindrome. This is not relevant to generating or identifying the n-th even-length palindrome number.

For example, if the input is `1`, the expected output is `11`, but the program will not return that value at all. It is focused on checking if the input string is a palindrome rather than generating or returning the requested even-length palindrome number. Thus, the program fails to fulfill the problem requirement.
