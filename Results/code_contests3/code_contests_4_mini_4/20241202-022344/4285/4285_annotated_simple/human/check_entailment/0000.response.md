Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires generating the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, whereas the program defines a function that checks if a given string (which is supposed to be a palindrome) is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and checking if the resulting string is equal to its reverse.

Here are the reasons for the incorrectness:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is designed to handle a string input rather than a positive integer. The problem specifies that the input is a single integer `n`, but the program attempts to process `n` as if it were a string containing alphabetic characters.
2. **Function Purpose**: The function's purpose is to check for palindromes, but the problem specifically asks for generating the n-th even-length palindrome number. The program does not implement any logic to generate or return palindrome numbers.
3. **Output**: The expected output for the function is an even-length palindrome number based on the input `n`, yet the current implementation returns a boolean value indicating whether a string is a palindrome, which is irrelevant to the problem requirement.

Hence, the program does not follow the problem description, and as such, it is deemed incorrect.
