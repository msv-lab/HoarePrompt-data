The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `n`, which is expected to contain alphanumeric characters. It processes the string by filtering out non-alphabetic characters and converting all remaining characters to lowercase, resulting in a new string `x`. The function then checks if this new string `x` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`x[::-1]`). 

However, the annotations incorrectly state that the function only handles the empty string case. In reality, it can handle any string containing alphabetic characters, and it will return `True` if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. It does not account for the possibility that the input string could contain no alphabetic characters at all, leading to `x` being an empty string, which would also return `True`.
