#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True since the empty string x is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts it to lowercase, and returns True if the filtered string is a palindrome (including the empty string case), or False otherwise.
