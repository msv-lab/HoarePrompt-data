The provided problem description requires a function that returns the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. An even-length palindrome is defined as a number that reads the same forward and backward and has an even number of digits.

The program provided is:
```python
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
```

This code does not address the problem description at all. Instead, it is designed to check if a given string (not an integer) is a palindrome by filtering out non-alphabetic characters and checking if the processed string is the same forwards and backwards. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Input Handling**: The function expects a string input, which is not aligned with the problem that states `n` will be a huge integer.
2. **Output**: The output is a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome, which does not match the requirement to return the n-th even-length palindrome number.
3. **Palindrome Logic**: The logic for determining palindromes is irrelevant to generating the n-th even-length positive palindrome number.

### Edge Cases:
- Any integer input (e.g., very large numbers like 10100) would not be processed correctly since the function is not designed to handle integers.
- The output does not return any palindrome number, so it fails for all valid inputs.

### Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints describe behavior related to string manipulation and palindrome checking, which is completely irrelevant to the problem of generating even-length palindromes. There is no agreement between the output hints and the intended function since they discuss a different type of function altogether.

### Conclusion:
The function does not follow the problem description, as it does not generate the n-th even-length palindrome number and is incorrect in terms of input handling and output. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in any case. It is designed for a completely different task.
