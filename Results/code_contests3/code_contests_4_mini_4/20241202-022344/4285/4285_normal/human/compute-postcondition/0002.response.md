The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{1000000} \). After executing the function body, it returns `True` since the empty string is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` based on the property of the empty string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns True.**
