The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `n`, which is expected to be a sequence of characters. It processes this string by filtering out only the alphabetic characters, converting them to lowercase, and then checking if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). The function returns `True` if the filtered string is empty or if it is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

It's important to note that the provided annotations inaccurately state that the function accepts a positive integer, while it actually takes a string. Additionally, the annotations do not account for the case where `n` contains no alphabetic characters, resulting in an empty string, which is also handled correctly as a palindrome. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts it to lowercase, and returns True if the filtered string is a palindrome (including the empty string case), or False otherwise. **
