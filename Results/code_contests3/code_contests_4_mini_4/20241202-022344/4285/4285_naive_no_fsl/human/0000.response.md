Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description at all. The function `func_1` is trying to determine if a given input (expected to be a string) is a palindrome by checking if it reads the same forwards and backwards after filtering out non-alphabetic characters. However, the problem requires generating the n-th even-length positive palindrome number based on an integer input `n`.

For instance, if we input `1`, we expect the output to be `11`, but the current function does not handle the input or output as specified. Additionally, the function is focused on checking for palindrome properties rather than generating them as required by the problem. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
