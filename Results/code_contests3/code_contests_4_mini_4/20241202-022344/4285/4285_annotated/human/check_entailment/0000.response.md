Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that we need to find the n-th even-length positive palindrome number based on a large integer input n. However, the annotated program defines a function that processes a string input, filtering out non-alphabetic characters and checking if the resultant string is a palindrome. This is fundamentally unrelated to generating or retrieving even-length palindrome numbers.

Key issues include:

1. **Input Type**: The function expects a string containing alphabetic characters, while the problem specifies that n is a positive integer.

2. **Functionality**: The function checks for palindromic properties of a string rather than generating even-length palindromes or finding the n-th even-length palindrome number.

3. **Output**: The function returns a boolean value (True or False) indicating if the string is a palindrome, while the problem requires it to output the n-th even-length positive palindrome number.

In summary, the program does not fulfill the requirements of producing the n-th even-length palindrome number as described in the problem statement.
