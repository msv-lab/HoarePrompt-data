Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). It returns `True` if the filtered string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise. The annotations incorrectly suggest that `n` is a positive integer; however, `n` should actually be a string that may contain alphabetic characters. **
