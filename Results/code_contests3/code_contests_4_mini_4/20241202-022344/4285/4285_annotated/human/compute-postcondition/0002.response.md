The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{1000000}\). After executing the function body, the program returns `True` because the empty string 'x' is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True`, indicating that the empty string is equal to its reverse. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `True`.**
