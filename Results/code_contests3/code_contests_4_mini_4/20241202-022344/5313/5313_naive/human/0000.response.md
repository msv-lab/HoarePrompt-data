To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and identify any potential cases where it may fail.

The problem requires calculating the minimum perimeter for a shape that encloses exactly N blocks. The provided code uses the following logic:

1. It calculates the integer square root of N (denoted as `x`), which represents the side length of the largest square that can be formed with `x*x` blocks.
2. It checks if `x*x` is equal to N. If true, it returns `4*x` as the perimeter for a perfect square.
3. If `x*(x+1)` is greater than N, it calculates the perimeter based on a rectangle with dimensions `x` by `x+1`, returning `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
4. Otherwise, it assumes that an extra row or column needs to be added, thus returning `4 * (x + 1)`.

Now, let's consider some potential edge cases:

- For N = 5:
  - `x = int(5 ** 0.5) = 2`
  - `x*x = 4` (not equal to 5)
  - `x*(x+1) = 2*3 = 6` (greater than 5, so it calculates perimeter as `(2 + 2 + 1) * 2 = 10`).
  - However, the minimum perimeter for 5 blocks (which can be arranged in a 3x2 rectangle) is actually 12, which indicates that this calculation is incorrect.

- For N = 10:
  - `x = int(10 ** 0.5) = 3`
  - `x*x = 9` (not equal to 10)
  - `x*(x+1) = 3*4 = 12` (greater than 10, so it calculates perimeter as `(3 + 3 + 1) * 2 = 14`).
  - However, the minimum perimeter for 10 blocks (which can be arranged in a 5x2 rectangle) is actually 14, so this case works correctly.

Since the program fails for N = 5, we can conclude that it does not handle all cases correctly.

Thus, the final answer is:
Correctness: **False**.
