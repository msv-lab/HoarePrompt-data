`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, and the square of `x` is equal to `n` (x² = n), `x` must be equal to the square root of `n`, thus `x` is the positive integer such that `x² = n`. Therefore, `answr` will be `4 * x`. 

As `n` is a perfect square within the given range, `x` is a positive integer and represents the square root of `n`. 

Thus, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
