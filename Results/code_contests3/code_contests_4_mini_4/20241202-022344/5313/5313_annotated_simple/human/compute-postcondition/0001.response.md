The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is an input integer within the range 1 to 10^6. The square root of `n` is calculated, and then it is converted to an integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `n` and `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.**
