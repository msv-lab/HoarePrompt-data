The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^6, so `n` will also be within this range after the input. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range.**
