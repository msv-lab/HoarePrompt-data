In the given initial state, we know that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. It is also stated that `n` is not a perfect square, and `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`. 

The code snippet provided is:
```
answr = 4 * (x + 1)
```

Now, we analyze the impact of this code. The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `4 * (x + 1)`. Given that `x` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `n`, we can derive the value of `answr` based on the value of `x`. Since `x` is an integer, `x + 1` will also be an integer.

Therefore, `answr` will be calculated as:
- If `x` is known, we can directly compute `answr` as `4` multiplied by `x + 1`.

Since the value of `x` depends on `n`, and `n` is in the range from 1 to 10^6, the precise value of `answr` can vary depending on the specific values of `n` and `x`.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact values of `n` and `x`, we can state the relationship and form of `answr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer within the same range; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`**.
