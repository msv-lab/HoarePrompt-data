The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a predefined positive integer `N`, which satisfies the constraint of being between 1 and 10^6. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate without parameters and presumably return some result based on the internal logic involving the positive integer `N`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is expected to return a result based on a predefined positive integer N, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6.**
