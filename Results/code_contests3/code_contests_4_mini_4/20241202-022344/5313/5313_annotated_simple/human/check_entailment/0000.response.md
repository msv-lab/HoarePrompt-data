To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and compare it with the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the minimum perimeter that can enclose an area of exactly \( N \) city blocks laid out in a square grid. The solution must correctly handle different shapes (rectangles, squares) that can enclose the given area \( N \).

### Analysis of the Annotated Program:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer \( N \).
   
2. **Calculation of `x`**:
   - It computes \( x \) as the integer part of the square root of \( n \) (i.e., \( x = \text{int}(n^{0.5}) \)).

3. **Perimeter Calculation**:
   - The program checks if \( x^2 = n \). If true, it sets `answr` to \( 4x \), which corresponds to the perimeter of a square with side length \( x \).
   - If \( x^2 \) is not equal to \( n \), it checks if \( x(x + 1) > n \):
     - If true, it calculates the perimeter as \( 2(x + x + 1) \), which corresponds to a rectangle.
     - If false, it computes the perimeter as \( 4(x + 1) \), which implies a larger square.

### Correctness Verification:
- **Case 1**: \( N = 4 \)
  - A square of side length \( 2 \) has a perimeter of \( 8 \) which is correctly returned.
  
- **Case 2**: \( N = 11 \)
  - The optimal shape is a rectangle (3x4), which has a perimeter of \( 14 \). The program correctly computes this.
  
- **Case 3**: \( N = 22 \)
  - The optimal shape can be a rectangle (5x4), which yields a perimeter of \( 20 \). The program successfully arrives at this result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter for the input \( N \) by considering different configurations (both squares and rectangles) and checking the conditions based on the integer square root \( x \). It handles edge cases appropriately by adjusting the perimeter calculations based on the relationship of \( x \) with \( n \).

Therefore, the program adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
