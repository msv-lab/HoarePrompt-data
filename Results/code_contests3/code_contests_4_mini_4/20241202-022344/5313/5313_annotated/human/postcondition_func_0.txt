The function does not accept any parameters and reads an integer input `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). It calculates an integer `x`, which is the integer square root of `n`. Based on the value of `n` and `x`, it determines a value `answr` which is printed as output. If `n` is a perfect square, `answr` is `4 * x`. If not, `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)` if `x * (x + 1) > n`, otherwise it is `4 * (x + 1)`. The function ultimately outputs the calculated value without any explicit return statement.
