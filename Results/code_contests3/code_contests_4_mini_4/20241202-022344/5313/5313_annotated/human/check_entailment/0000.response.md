Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum perimeter for all possible integer values of \( N \) (the number of blocks). Let's analyze the logic in the program and where it fails:

1. **Perfect Squares**: The program correctly identifies when \( N \) is a perfect square. In this case, the perimeter is calculated as \( 4 \times x \), where \( x \) is the integer square root of \( N \). This is correct for perfect squares.

2. **Non-Perfect Squares**: For non-perfect squares, the program attempts to determine the perimeter based on the conditions:
   - If \( x \times (x + 1) > n \), it sets \( answr = 4x + 2 \).
   - Otherwise, it sets \( answr = 4 \times (x + 1) \).

   However, the logic for determining the perimeter for non-square values is flawed. The perimeter for a given area \( N \) is not simply calculated as \( 4 \times (x + 1) \) or \( 4x + 2 \). The correct perimeter must take into account the specific configuration of the blocks which can be more complex than the current implementation suggests.

3. **Example Failure Cases**:
   - For \( N = 11 \): The expected minimum perimeter is \( 14 \) (a rectangle of dimensions \( 3 \times 4 \)), but the program may not return this valid configuration due to its flawed logic.
   - For \( N = 22 \): The expected minimum perimeter is \( 20 \) (a rectangle of dimensions \( 5 \times 5 \)), but again, the logic in the program does not correctly compute this.

In summary, the program does not account for all potential rectangular configurations that can yield the minimum perimeter for non-square values of \( N \). Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the problem description correctly for all cases.
