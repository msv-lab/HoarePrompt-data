`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which means `x` will be the integer square root of `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer and is subject to the constraint that it is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6. Therefore, `x` will be calculated accordingly based on the value of `n`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.**
