In the given code, `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The variable `x` holds the integer square root of `n`, and since `x * (x + 1) <= n` is true, we can determine the value of `answr` based on the value of `x`. 

Since `x` is known to be an integer, we can compute `answr` directly as follows:

- `answr = 4 * (x + 1)`

The value of `x` is not specified, but it is defined as the integer square root of `n`. Given that `x` must be a positive integer, the output state will reflect the relationship in the formula.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`**.
