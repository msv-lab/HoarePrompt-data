The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `(x + x + 1) * 2`. The value of `x` is the integer square root of `n`, which means `x` is a positive integer. Therefore, `answr` can be calculated as follows:

1. Calculate `x + x + 1`, which is `2x + 1`.
2. Multiply the result by `2`, leading to `answr = (2x + 1) * 2 = 4x + 2`.

Since `n` is an input integer and `x` is defined in relation to `n`, the exact value of `answr` depends on the value of `x`. However, the output state summarizes the relationships between the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n` where `x` squared is not equal to `n`, and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`; `answr` is equal to `4x + 2`.**
