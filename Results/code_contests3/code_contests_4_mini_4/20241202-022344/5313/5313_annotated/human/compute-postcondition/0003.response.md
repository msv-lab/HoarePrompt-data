The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer square root of `n` and `x` squared is equal to `n`, it follows that `n = x^2`. Therefore, the value of `answr` is `4 * x`. The output state considers the previous values of `N`, `n`, and `x` without any changes to them. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
