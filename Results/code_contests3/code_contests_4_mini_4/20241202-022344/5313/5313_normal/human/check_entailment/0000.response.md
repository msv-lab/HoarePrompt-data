To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Understanding
The program needs to find the minimum perimeter of a shape that encloses exactly N city blocks. Given the examples, we can deduce that:
- For a perfect square of size x (where N = xÂ²), the perimeter is 4x.
- For other shapes, the perimeter calculation involves finding how the blocks can be arranged to minimize the perimeter.

### Code Analysis
1. The program calculates the integer square root of N:
   ```python
   x = int(n ** 0.5)
   ```
   
2. It checks if N is a perfect square:
   ```python
   if x ** 2 == n:
       answr = x * 4
   ```
   This part seems correct for perfect squares.

3. Next, it checks if the product of `x` and `x + 1` is greater than `n`:
   ```python
   elif x * (x + 1) > n:
       answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
   ```
   This condition is to handle cases where the shape can be formed by extending one dimension.

4. If neither of the above conditions are satisfied, it assumes the perimeter can be formed by adding another block:
   ```python
   else:
       answr = 4 * (x + 1)
   ```

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints summarize the behavior of the function:
- If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4` times the square root of `n`.
- If not a perfect square and `x * (x + 1) > n`, it returns `4 * x + 2`.
- Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Edge Case Consideration
We need to ensure that all edge cases are handled:
- For N = 1, the minimum perimeter should be 4 (1 block forms a square).
- For N = 2, the minimum perimeter should be 6 (2 blocks can form a line).
- For N = 3, the minimum perimeter should be 8 (3 blocks can form an L shape).
- For N = 5, the minimum perimeter should be 12 (5 blocks can form a cross shape).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle several cases:
- For N = 3, it calculates a perimeter of 8, which is correct, but for N = 5, it does not accurately account that the minimum perimeter is 12.
- The conditions do not effectively differentiate when to add extra perimeter for irregular shapes like L or T shapes that can occur between perfect squares.

### Final Assessment
Given that the code does not correctly handle every potential case as described in the problem, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The code fails to compute the correct perimeter for certain values of N, specifically for configurations that are not perfect squares or simple rectangles.
