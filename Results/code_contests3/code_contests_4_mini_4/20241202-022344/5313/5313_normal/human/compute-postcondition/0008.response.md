The code assigns the value `4 * (x + 1)` to the variable `answr`. The variable `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and it is given that `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`. Thus, `x` is a positive integer derived from `n`. 

Since `x` is known to be a positive integer, we can calculate `answr` based on its value. However, since the specific value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, we can only state the relationship.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * (x + 1)`**.
