`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which is the integer square root of `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and since `N` is a positive integer that can range from 1 to 10^6, `x` will take on values based on the square root of that input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
