Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (input from the user) and calculates a value `answr` based on the integer square root of `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4` times the square root of `n`. If it is not a perfect square and the product of the integer square root and one more than itself is greater than `n`, it returns `4` times the integer square root plus `2`. Otherwise, it returns `4` times one more than the integer square root. The output is printed directly and does not return a value. **
