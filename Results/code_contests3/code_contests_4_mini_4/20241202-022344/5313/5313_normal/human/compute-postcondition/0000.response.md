`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `N` remains unchanged. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6, `n` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer.**
