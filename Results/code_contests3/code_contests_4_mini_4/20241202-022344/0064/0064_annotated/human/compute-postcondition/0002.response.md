To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step.

1. We have `s`, which is the sum of the integers in the list `c`.
2. The code checks two conditions:
   - If `s` is equal to 0.
   - If `s` is not divisible evenly by the length of the list `c`.
3. If either condition is true, it will print `-1`.
4. If both conditions are false, it will print the result of `s / len(c)`.

Since we're given that `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are integers representing the number of coins each player has, we can calculate `s` as `c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`, and `len(c)` would be 5 (assuming `c` contains these five integers).

Now, we will summarize the output based on the conditions of `s`:

- If `s == 0`, the output will be `-1`.
- If `s % 5 != 0`, the output will also be `-1`.
- If `s > 0` and `s % 5 == 0`, the output will be `s / 5`.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as:

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers; `s` is the sum of these integers; result is -1 if `s` is 0 or `s % 5 != 0`, otherwise it is `s / 5`.**
