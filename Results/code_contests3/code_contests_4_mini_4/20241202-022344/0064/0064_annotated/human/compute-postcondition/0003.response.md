The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any. However, it operates on five integer values representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game, denoted as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. Each of these integers is constrained to the range 0 ≤ ci ≤ 100.

The function evaluates these values and returns a result based on them. Since there are no specific output cases provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the return values or cases.

Functionality: **The function operates on five integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game, where each integer is in the range 0 to 100. The specific output based on these integers is not defined in the provided information.**
