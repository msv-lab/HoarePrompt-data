To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to evaluate how the program calculates the initial bet size `b` and whether it correctly handles all potential cases given the input constraints.

The expected logic based on the problem statement is:

1. Each player starts with `b` coins, so the total number of coins at the start is `5 * b`.
2. After some transactions between players, the total number of coins remains the same. Thus, if we denote the final coin counts as `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`, the sum should equal the total initial coins: `c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5 = 5 * b`.
3. From this equation, we can deduce that `b = (c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5) / 5`.
4. For `b` to be valid, it needs to be a positive integer, which means the sum of coins should be positive and divisible by 5.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

- The program reads five integers and calculates the sum `s`.
- It checks if `s` is zero or if `s` is not divisible by the length of `c` (which is 5).
- If either condition is true, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid `b` exists.
- If neither condition is true, it computes `b` as `s / len(c)`.

Here are the potential issues:

1. The program correctly identifies that if all players have zero coins, it should return `-1`. This is correct since `b` cannot be zero.
2. The program checks if `s % len(c) != 0`, which is equivalent to checking if `s % 5 != 0` since `len(c)` is always 5. This is also correct because `b` needs to be an integer.
3. However, the program does not check if `b` is positive after calculating it. The condition `s == 0` already covers the case where all players might have zero coins, but we need to ensure that the calculated `b` is strictly positive.

Let's consider a case where the sum is positive but does not lead to a valid positive `b`. For example:

Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
- Here, `s = 5`, which is divisible by 5, so it would calculate `b = 5 / 5 = 1`.
- This is valid.

Input: `0 0 0 0 1`
- Here, `s = 1`, which is not divisible by 5, so it would return `-1`, which is also valid.

However, the problematic case arises when:

Input: `1 1 1 2 2`
- Here, `s = 7`, which is not divisible by 5, so it should return `-1`, which is correct.
  
But, if we take:

Input: `1 1 1 2 0`
- Here, `s = 5`, which is divisible by 5, so it calculates `b = 5 / 5 = 1`, which is valid.

But let's test with:

Input: `1 1 1 1 0`
- Here, `s = 4`, which is also not divisible by 5, so it would return `-1`, which is correct.

The program correctly handles these inputs and does not miss any edge cases given the rules.

Thus, after careful analysis, it appears that all potential cases are handled correctly by the program.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly calculates the initial bet `b` when possible and returns `-1` when it is not feasible based on the rules of the game.
