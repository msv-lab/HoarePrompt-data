To evaluate the provided Python code snippet based on the initial state, we start by analyzing the variables involved.

Initial State: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game; `s` is the sum of the coins in list `c`. 

1. First, we calculate `s`, which is the sum of the coins: 
   \[
   s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5
   \]
2. Next, we check if `s` is equal to 0 or if `s` is not divisible evenly by the number of players (which is `len(c)`, or 5 in this case).
3. If either condition is true, we print -1; otherwise, we calculate `s / len(c)`.

After evaluating the conditions, depending on the value of `s`, we can determine the appropriate output.

Output State: **`s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`; print -1 if `s` is 0 or `s` is not divisible by 5, otherwise print `s / 5`.**
