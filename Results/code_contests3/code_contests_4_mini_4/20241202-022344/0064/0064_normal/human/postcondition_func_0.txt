The function accepts input representing the number of coins each of five players has, calculates the total number of coins, and returns -1 if the total is zero or if the total is not evenly divisible by the number of players (which is always 5). If the total is divisible by 5, it returns the average number of coins per player. The function does not explicitly limit the number of players to five, as described in the annotations, but it assumes the input will always correspond to five players based on the context.
