The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It evaluates the number of coins each of the five players have at the end of the game. Based on the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, which are integers with the constraints 0 ≤ c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 ≤ 100, the function produces output based on specific conditions. 

Since no specific output cases were provided in the prompt, I will summarize the functionality based on the presence of the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function evaluates the number of coins for five players at the end of the game and processes this information according to defined conditions, but does not accept any parameters.**
