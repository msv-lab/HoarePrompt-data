The code checks the value of `s`, which is assigned the sum of the list `c`. If `s` is 0, it prints `-1`. If `s` is not divisible by the length of `c`, it also prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `s / len(c)`. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` do not change and are unaffected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are unchanged integers; `s` is assigned the sum of the list `c`, and `-1` is printed if `s == 0` or `s % len(c) != 0`, otherwise `s / len(c)` is printed.**
