The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means it is being populated with a list of strings split from the input. Since `N` is a positive integer and specifies the number of integers to be inputted, `a` will now hold a list of `N` elements, where each element corresponds to one integer provided in the input. However, the exact integers are not available, as they will be based on user input. The state of `N` remains unchanged as the input does not modify its value.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers as strings from input.**
