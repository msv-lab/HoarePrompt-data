In the given code snippet, `ans` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. The variable `a`, which is a list of `N` integers (provided as strings from input), will first need to be converted to integers to calculate the maximum and minimum values. 

1. The maximum value of the list `a` is determined using `np.max(a)`.
2. The minimum value of the list `a` is determined using `np.min(a)`.
3. The absolute difference between these two values is calculated using `np.abs(...)`.
4. The result is assigned to `ans`.

Since `N` is a positive integer and can range from 1 to 100, and `a` contains `N` integers, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, as well as the calculated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers as strings from input; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a` after conversion to integers.**
