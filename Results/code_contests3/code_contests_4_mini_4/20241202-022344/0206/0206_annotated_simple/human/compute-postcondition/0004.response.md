The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), and `a`, which is a list of `N` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 1000\). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the output description. Therefore, based on the provided constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `N` and a list of integers `a` with specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a list a of N integers, where each integer in a is between 0 and 1000.**
