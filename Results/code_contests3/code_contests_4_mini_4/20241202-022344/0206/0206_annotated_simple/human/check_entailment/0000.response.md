Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3. It should be `input()` instead. However, this issue is minor compared to the logic implemented.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum distance as `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`. While this computes the distance between the furthest two houses, the problem states that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any position. Thus, it requires finding the total distance he would travel by visiting all houses, which is not simply the distance between the farthest points.

3. **Misinterpretation of the Problem**: The correct calculation for the minimum distance in this context should involve starting from the house with the smallest coordinate to the house with the largest coordinate. Given the list of coordinates, the total distance would be `max(a) - min(a)`, which is indeed computed, but the program does not account for the fact that AtCoDeer must return to the starting point if he travels to all houses. Thus, he would need to cover the distance twice (to and from).

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where there is only one house. The distance should be zero in that case, but the provided logic will still compute a distance based on the maximum and minimum values, which would be the same, resulting in zero, but not giving a clear output for that specific case as required.

In conclusion, the program does not implement the required logic correctly as per the problem description, which results in it being incorrect.
