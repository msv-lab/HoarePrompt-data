Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum distance to be traveled, as required by the problem description. The issue lies in the way the input values are handled. Specifically, the program uses `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` where `a` is a list of strings (the result of `raw_input().split()`). This results in incorrect behavior because the maximum and minimum values will be computed based on string comparison rather than numerical comparison.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The variable `a` becomes `['2', '3', '7', '9']`. The string maximum will be `'9'` and the string minimum will be `'2'`, leading to a computed distance of `np.abs(9 - 2)`, which is correct. However, if the input is:
```
4
10 2 20 3
```
`a` would be `['10', '2', '20', '3']`, and `np.max(a)` would incorrectly yield `'3'` as the maximum due to string comparison, leading to an incorrect distance calculation.

Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the input is empty or contains invalid entries, which could also introduce errors. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
