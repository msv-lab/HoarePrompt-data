The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` derived from the string input `N`. The values of `N` and `a` are not directly changed by this statement, but the output will display the value of `ans`. 

Since `ans` has been established as the absolute difference based on lexicographical order, the output state will reflect that the value of `ans` is printed. 

Output State: **`N` is a string input, `a` is a list of strings derived from `N`, `ans` is printed**.
