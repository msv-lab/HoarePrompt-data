To determine the output state, we start by analyzing the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

1. `a` is a list of strings derived from the input `N`. The specific values of `a` depend on how `N` was split into strings.
2. `np.max(a)` will find the maximum value among the strings in list `a`. In Python, this will be based on lexicographical order since the elements are strings.
3. `np.min(a)` will find the minimum value among the strings in list `a`, also based on lexicographical order.
4. `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` will compute the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values found in `a`.

As the specific values of `a` are unknown, we can only state the general impact based on the operations performed. The calculation of the absolute difference will yield a result, but without concrete values, we cannot specify what that result is.

Given this, the output state reflects the operations performed and the nature of the variables involved:

Output State: **`N` is a string input, `a` is a list of strings derived from `N`; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a` (based on lexicographical order).**
