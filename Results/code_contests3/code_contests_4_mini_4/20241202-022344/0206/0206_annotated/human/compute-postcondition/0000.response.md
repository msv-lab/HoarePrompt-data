The value of `N` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input as a string. Since `N` is supposed to be an integer within the range 1 to 100, the output state indicates that `N` is now a string representation of the input. The list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a string input; `a` is a list of N integers.

Output State: **`N` is a string input; `a` is a list of N integers**
