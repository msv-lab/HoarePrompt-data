`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes a string input and splits it into a list of substrings. Since `N` is a string input and `a` is a list of N integers, the previous state of `a` is now replaced with a list of string representations of the integers provided in the input. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a string input, `a` is now a list of strings derived from the input.

Output State: **`N` is a string input, `a` is now a list of strings derived from the input.**
