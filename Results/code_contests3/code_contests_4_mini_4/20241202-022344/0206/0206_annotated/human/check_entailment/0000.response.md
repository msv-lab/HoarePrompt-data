Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution according to the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read inputs, which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`), and does not convert the input values into integers. As a result, the list `a` consists of strings rather than integers, which leads to incorrect calculations when determining the maximum and minimum values.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The calculation `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` is supposed to find the minimum distance AtCoDeer has to travel. However, `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` will not work as intended because they are applied to a list of strings. Moreover, the correct logic for minimum distance in this context should be to calculate the distance between the furthest houses that AtCoDeer must cover, which is effectively the difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates.

3. **Output**: The program prints the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list, which does not indicate the total distance traveled if the start and end points can be any position along the path. The correct output should be the distance between the furthest apart houses, which is already what the program is trying to do, but it fails due to the input handling issue.

4. **Constraints Handling**: The program does not check if the input values adhere to the constraints provided in the problem description, such as ensuring that `N` matches the length of the list `a`.

In conclusion, the program does not follow the problem description correctly due to input handling issues and type mismatches. Thus, it is incorrect.
