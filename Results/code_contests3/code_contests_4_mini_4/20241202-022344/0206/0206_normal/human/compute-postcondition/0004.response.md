The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates on the constraints provided: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000. 

The exact output of the function based on the provided constraints and relationships is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot determine specific cases or output values. However, we can summarize the input structure.

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a list a containing N integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), but it does not have a defined return value based on the provided information.**
