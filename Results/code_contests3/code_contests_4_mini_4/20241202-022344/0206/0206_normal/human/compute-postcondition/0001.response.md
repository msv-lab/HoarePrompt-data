The line `a = raw_input().split()` takes input from the user as a string, splits it into components based on whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to `a`. However, since `N` is an integer reflecting the number of integers to be stored in `a`, the state of `a` will depend on the user input. The previous values of `N` and the contents of `a` are not directly affected until the input is provided.

Since `N` is defined as an integer between 1 and 100, we expect `a` to be a list of integers with a length equal to `N`. The variables `N` remains unchanged, and the previous values of `a` (if any) are overwritten. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers from user input.**
