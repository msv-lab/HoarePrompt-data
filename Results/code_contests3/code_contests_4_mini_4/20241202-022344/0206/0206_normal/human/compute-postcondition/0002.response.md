To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code based on the initial conditions.

`ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `N` integers provided by user input, the specific values of `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` will depend on the actual integers in the list.

However, given the constraints (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100), we know that `a` will contain integers within a certain range, and thus `np.max(a)` will yield the highest integer in the list while `np.min(a)` will yield the lowest integer. The `np.abs()` function will ensure that the result is non-negative.

Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `ans` holds the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the user-provided list. Since we do not know the specific integers in `a`, we can only state that `ans` is the absolute difference of those values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers from user input; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a`.**
