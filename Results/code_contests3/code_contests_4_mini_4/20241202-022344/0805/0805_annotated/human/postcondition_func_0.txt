The function accepts an integer `n` (which is read from input) and a string `strings` (also read from input) consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet and wraps around if necessary, producing a new string. The function then prints the resultant shifted string. However, the function does not handle the case where the input `n` is out of the specified range (0 <= n <= 26), and if `n` is not provided as expected, the function will not behave correctly.
