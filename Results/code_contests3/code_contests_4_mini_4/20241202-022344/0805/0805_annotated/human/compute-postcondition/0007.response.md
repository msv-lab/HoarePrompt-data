The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. Here, `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`, where `index` is the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`, and `n` is an input integer between 0 and 26. The value of `new_index` will therefore be the remainder of `added_index` when divided by 26. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**.
