To determine the output state, let's analyze the code snippet provided:

1. `s` is the second character in `strings`.
2. `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, which is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
3. `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`.
4. `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`.

The code `new_s = letters[new_index]` assigns the character from `letters` at the position `new_index` to `new_s`. 

The variables affected are `new_s`, but we need to understand how `new_index` is derived from the initial state.

Given:
- `s` is the second character of `strings`.
- `index` is derived from the position of `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` adds `n` to `index`.
- `new_index` wraps around using modulo 26 to ensure it remains a valid index for the `letters` string.

Therefore, the output state will describe how `new_s` is determined based on these computations.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s` is the second character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is calculated as index + n, `new_index` is calculated as added_index % 26; `new_s` is the character from `letters` at position `new_index`.**
