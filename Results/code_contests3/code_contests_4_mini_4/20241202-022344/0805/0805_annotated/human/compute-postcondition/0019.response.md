The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is previously calculated as `index + n`. The value of `index` is determined by the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer between 0 and 26. Thus, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is equal to `index + n`, `new_index` is added_index % 26**
