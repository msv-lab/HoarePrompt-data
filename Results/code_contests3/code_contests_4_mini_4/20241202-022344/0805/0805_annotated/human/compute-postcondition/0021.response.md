The variable `new_strings` is appended with the value of `new_s`. The previous values of the relevant variables are `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s`, which are all defined based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state is determined by the existing values of these variables.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least 3 characters; `s` is the third character in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is equal to `index + n`; `new_index` is added_index % 26; `new_s` is the letter at `new_index` in `letters`; `new_strings` has been updated by appending `new_s`.**
