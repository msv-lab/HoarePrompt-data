The variable `new_strings` is being appended with the value of `new_s`. The previous state of `new_strings` is not provided, but since it is a string, the operation will result in `new_strings` being updated to include the new character `new_s`. The values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `s` is the second character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is calculated as index + n, `new_index` is calculated as added_index % 26; `new_strings` is updated by appending `new_s`.**
