The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `N`. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. The length of `S` is at least 1 and at most 10,000. The function performs operations based on these inputs, but the specific return values based on the input parameters have not been provided. Therefore, without additional details on the output cases, I cannot define the functionality completely.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `S`, consisting of uppercase English letters, and an integer `N` within the range of 0 to 26. The function performs operations based on these inputs, but the specific return values are not detailed.**
