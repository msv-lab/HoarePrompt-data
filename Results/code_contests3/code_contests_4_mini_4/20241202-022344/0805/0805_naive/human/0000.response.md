Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It reads an integer `N` and a string `S`, then shifts each character in `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order, wrapping around from `Z` to `A` as needed. 

The program works as follows:
1. It defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
2. For each character in the input string `S`, it finds the index of that character in `letters`.
3. It adds the shift value `N` to that index and calculates the new index using modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around correctly.
4. It constructs the new string `new_strings` by concatenating the resulting characters.
5. Finally, it prints the new shifted string.

The program handles all edge cases effectively:
- When `N` is 0, the output is the same as the input string.
- When `N` is equal to or greater than 1 and up to 26, it correctly wraps characters around to the start of the alphabet after `Z`.

Since the implementation adheres to the problem description and successfully processes the input according to the specified rules, it is deemed correct.
