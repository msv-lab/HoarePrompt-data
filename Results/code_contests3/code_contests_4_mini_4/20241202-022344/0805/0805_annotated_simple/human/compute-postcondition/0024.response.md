The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates on a string `S`, which consists of uppercase English letters, and an integer `N`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\). The length of `S` is between 1 and 10,000. 

The function returns different outputs based on the conditions defined within its body. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the string `S` and the integer `N`, returning results based on the specified logic that depends on the values of `S` and `N`. 

Functionality: **The function processes a string S of uppercase English letters and an integer N (0 <= N <= 26), returning results based on defined logic related to S and N.**
