The variable `new_strings` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the other variables (`S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, and `letters`) are unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is an input string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', and `new_strings` is an empty string.
