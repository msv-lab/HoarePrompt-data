To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Initial State:** 
   - `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
   - `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `strings` has at least 3 characters.
   - `s` is the third character in `strings`.
   - `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.
   - `added_index` is `index + n`.

2. **Execution of the Code:**
   - The code `new_index = added_index % 26` calculates the new index by taking the modulus of `added_index` with 26.

3. **Variables Affected:**
   - `added_index` is affected by the sum of `index` and `n`.
   - `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`.

4. **Calculating the Result:**
   - Since `added_index` is defined as `index + n`, `new_index` will be computed based on that value. 
   - The specific values of `index` and `n` are not provided, but they will determine the value of `new_index`.

Given this analysis, the output state incorporates the variables `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, and the newly computed `new_index`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
