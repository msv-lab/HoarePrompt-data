To determine the output state, we need to analyze the effect of the given code on the initial state. Here are the relevant variables:

- `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `strings` is a non-empty input string.
- `s` is the first character of `strings`.
- `new_strings` is an empty string.
- `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` is `index + n`.
- `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
new_s = letters[new_index]
```

1. The variable `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, which is based on the `index` of `s` and the value of `n`. 
2. The value of `new_s` is then determined by indexing into `letters` at the `new_index`.

Since `letters` consists of the uppercase English letters (A-Z), we can deduce that `letters` is defined as `"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"`. 

The variables `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` will all depend on the specific values of `s` and `n`. However, since `index` is defined as the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` will also be directly dependent on `n`.

Therefore, `new_s` will be the character found at position `new_index` in the `letters` string.

The output state will summarize the original values and the impact of the code:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty input string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position `new_index` in `letters`.**
