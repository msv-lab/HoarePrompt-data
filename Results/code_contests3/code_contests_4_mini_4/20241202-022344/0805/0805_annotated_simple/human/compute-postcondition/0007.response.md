To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state:

1. **Understanding Variables**:
   - `added_index` is defined as `index + n`.
   - Since `index` is derived from the character `s` and the value of `n` is a non-negative integer within the range from 0 to 26, the value of `added_index` will be within the range of `index` + `n`.
   - The variable `new_index` is computed as `added_index % 26`.
   - This means that `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The calculation of `new_index` does not alter the values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `s`, `new_strings`, or `index`. 
   - The only variable affected is `new_index`, which is being assigned a new value based on the calculated `added_index`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The output state will reflect the unchanged values of the initial variables along with the newly computed value of `new_index`. 
   - The specific value of `new_index` cannot be determined without the actual values of `added_index`.

Thus, the output state will summarize the unchanged variables and indicate the computation of `new_index`:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty input string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`**.
