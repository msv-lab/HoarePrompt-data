The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are known from the initial state, where `index` is the index of the first character `s` in `letters` (a list of uppercase English letters), and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. The output value for `added_index` can vary depending on the values of `index` and `n`, but it will always be the sum of those two variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty input string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty input string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`.**
