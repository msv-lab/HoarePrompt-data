The value of `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous values of the affected variables are `index` and `n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of `index` and `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`.**
