Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `N` that is read from input (0 <= N <= 26). It shifts each letter in the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and outputs the resulting string. The function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the transformed string.**
