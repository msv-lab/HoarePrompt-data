To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided variables and the code executed.

1. `new_strings` is initially an empty string.
2. The code `new_strings += new_s` appends the value of `new_s` to `new_strings`.

Since the values of `N`, `S`, `strings`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are not explicitly given, we can summarize the impact of the code based on the information that `new_s` will be a valid character derived from the calculations involving `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index`.

No other variables are affected by this operation, and the previous state of `new_strings` was empty. After execution, `new_strings` will contain the character `new_s`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `new_strings` now includes the character determined by the previously defined logic.

Output State: **`new_strings` now includes `new_s`.**
