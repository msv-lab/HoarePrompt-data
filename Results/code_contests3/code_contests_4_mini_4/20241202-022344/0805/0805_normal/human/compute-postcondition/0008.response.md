The value of `new_index` is computed as `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is `index + N`. The variable `new_s` is then assigned the value of `letters` at the position `new_index`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + N`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is the character from `letters` at position `new_index`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `strings` is a non-empty string; `s` is the first character of `strings`; `new_strings` is an empty string; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + N`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is the character from `letters` at position `new_index`.**
