`new_strings` is assigned the value of `new_strings` concatenated with `new_s`. Since `new_s` is already defined and `new_strings` includes `new_s`, the output state reflects that `new_strings` now has one additional occurrence of `new_s`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` now includes an additional `new_s`, `strings` must have at least one more element, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, and `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26; `new_s` is letters[new_index].
