The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is known, but the specific value is not provided. Therefore, the exact value of `new_index` cannot be determined, but it will be a remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`new_strings` includes `new_s`, `strings` must have at least one more element, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, and `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`.**
