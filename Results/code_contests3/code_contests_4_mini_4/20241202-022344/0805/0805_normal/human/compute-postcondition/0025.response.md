Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (where 0 <= N <= 26) and a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each character in `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and outputs the resulting string. However, the function lacks input validation, meaning it assumes valid inputs will always be provided without handling potential input errors. **
