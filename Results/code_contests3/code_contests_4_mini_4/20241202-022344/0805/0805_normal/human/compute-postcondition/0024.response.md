The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is an integer with the constraint that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\), and a parameter `S`, which is a string consisting of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10,000. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the defined logic. However, since the specific output based on the parameters is not provided, I will only describe the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter N (where 0 <= N <= 26) and a string parameter S (which consists of uppercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10,000).**
