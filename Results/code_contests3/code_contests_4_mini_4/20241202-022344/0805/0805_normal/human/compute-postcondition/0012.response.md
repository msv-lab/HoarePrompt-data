The value of `added_index` is assigned the result of `index + n`. The previous values of `index` and `n` are not specified, but `index` is known to represent the position of `s` in `letters`. Therefore, `added_index` will be a value dependent on the sum of `index` and `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` includes `new_s`, `strings` must have more elements, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, and `added_index` is the result of `index + n`.

Output State: **`new_strings` includes `new_s`, `strings` must have more elements, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`.**
