The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is dependent on `index` and `n`, but the specific values of `index` and `n` are not provided. However, we know that `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, and this can yield various results when taken modulo 26. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects this variability.

Output State: **`new_strings` includes `new_s`, `strings` must have more elements, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is the result of `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
