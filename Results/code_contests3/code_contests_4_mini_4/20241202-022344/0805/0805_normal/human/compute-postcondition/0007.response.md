The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The variable `added_index` is calculated as `index + N`, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `N` is an integer such that `0 <= N <= 26`. Therefore, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + N`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
