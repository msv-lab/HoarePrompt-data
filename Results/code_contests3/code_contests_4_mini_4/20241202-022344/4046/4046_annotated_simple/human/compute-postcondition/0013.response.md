According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which determines the number of repetitions in the `product` function. Since `i` is now equal to `l`, and `l` is an even number less than 10, it is valid to iterate over `product('74', repeat=i)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l`, which is an even number less than 10. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the total number of combinations that can be formed with `repeat=i`. 

In the next iteration:
- The value of `i` will increment, so it will be `l + 1`.
- The variable `x` will represent the next combination generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to the maximum number of combinations that can be generated with `l + 1`. Since `l` is an even number less than 10, `i + 1` will also be valid as long as `i + 1` does not exceed the maximum combinations.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, `tem` is 4444477777, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to the maximum combinations generated with `repeat=l + 1`.**
