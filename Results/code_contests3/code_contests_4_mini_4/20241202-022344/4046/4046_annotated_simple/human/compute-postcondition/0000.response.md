The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` can be any positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
