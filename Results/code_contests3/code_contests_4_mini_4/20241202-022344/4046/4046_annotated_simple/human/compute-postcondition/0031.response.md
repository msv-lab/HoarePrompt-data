Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The values of `l`, `i`, and `tem` remain unchanged, where `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2` (which is at least 2), and `tem` is the integer formed from the string `x`. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, then `ans` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
