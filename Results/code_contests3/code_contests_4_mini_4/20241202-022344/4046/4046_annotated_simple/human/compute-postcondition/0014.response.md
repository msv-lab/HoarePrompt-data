The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its contents. As a result, we cannot compute the exact value of `tem`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is an integer created from the contents of `x`, which is currently undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is an integer created from the contents of `x`, which is currently undefined.**
