Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the valid `tem` values found that are greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `tem`. The values of `l`, `i`, and `tem` remain consistent with their definitions, where `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 4`, `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
