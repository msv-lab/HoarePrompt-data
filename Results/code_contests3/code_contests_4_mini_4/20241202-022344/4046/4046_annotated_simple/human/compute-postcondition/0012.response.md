Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is now `l`, and `tem` is 4444477777. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then all variables maintain their conditions, and the function proceeds accordingly.***
