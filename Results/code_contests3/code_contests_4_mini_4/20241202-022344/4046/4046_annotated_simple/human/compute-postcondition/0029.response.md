The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is an integer that is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `ans` is the minimum of `4444477777` and the valid `tem` values found, the output state reflects the new value of `ans` after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2` (which is at least 2), and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2` (which is at least 2), `tem` is greater than or equal to `n**
