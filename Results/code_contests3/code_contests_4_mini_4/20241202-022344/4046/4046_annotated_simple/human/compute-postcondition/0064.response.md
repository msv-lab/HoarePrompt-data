The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraint that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The function will return a value based on the input constraint of `n`, but since the output behavior is not specified in the provided output section, we cannot describe specific return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with a positive integer `n` within the specified range, although the specific output is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with the constraint that n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific return value is not provided.**
