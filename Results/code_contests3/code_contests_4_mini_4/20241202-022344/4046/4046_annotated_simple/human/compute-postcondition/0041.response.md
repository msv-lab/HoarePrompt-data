Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2`, and `x` is the next combination of length `i` from the product of '74'. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x', and if `tem` (the integer value of the joined string `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.***
