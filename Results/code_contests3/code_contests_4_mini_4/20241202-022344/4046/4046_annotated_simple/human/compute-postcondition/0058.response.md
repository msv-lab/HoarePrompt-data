The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is defined as `int(''.join(x))` but is currently unknown. The initial state indicates that `ans` is already the minimum of 4444477777 and valid `tem` values that are greater than or equal to `n`. Since `tem` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, `ans` will remain the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and valid `tem` values that are greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, tem)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and valid `tem` values that are greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to `min(ans, tem)`**.
