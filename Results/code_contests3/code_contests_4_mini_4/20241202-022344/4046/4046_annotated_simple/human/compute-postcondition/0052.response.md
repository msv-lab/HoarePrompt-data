`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the list of characters in `x` (generated from the product of '74') into a single string and then into an integer. The previous values of `x` and the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the valid `tem` values found that are greater than or equal to `n`, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 4`, and `x` is the next combination of length `i` from the product of '74'; `tem` is the integer value created from `x`.
