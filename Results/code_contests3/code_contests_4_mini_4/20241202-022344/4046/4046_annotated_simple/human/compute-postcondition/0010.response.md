`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. Given that both `ans` and `tem` are 4444477777, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is now `l`, `tem` is 4444477777, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is now `l`, `tem` is 4444477777, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
