The value of `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a list of strings that are joined together and converted to an integer. The initial state indicates that `tem` is being set but does not provide the prior value of `x`, which means we cannot determine the precise value of `tem`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `l` remains an even number less than 10, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`.
