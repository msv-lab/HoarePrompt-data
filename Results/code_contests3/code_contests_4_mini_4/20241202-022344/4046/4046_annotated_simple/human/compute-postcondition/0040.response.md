Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2`, `x` is the next combination of length `i` from the product of '74', and `tem` is the integer value of the joined string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.***
