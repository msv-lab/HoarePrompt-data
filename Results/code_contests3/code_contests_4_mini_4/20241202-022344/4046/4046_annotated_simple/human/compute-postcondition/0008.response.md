`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is an iterable that is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we know that the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, which suggests that `x` contains an equal number of both digits. Given that `ans` is 4444477777, a possible representation of `x` could be the digits in `ans`. Thus, if we assume `x` to be a string representation of `ans`, `x` would be '4444477777'. 

The concatenation of the characters in `x` (which is already a string) would still yield '4444477777', and converting this to an integer would result in the integer value 4444477777. The variable `tem` would then hold this value.

Other variables (`n`, `ans`, `l`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is now `l`, and `tem` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is 4444477777, `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` is now `l`, `tem` is 4444477777**
