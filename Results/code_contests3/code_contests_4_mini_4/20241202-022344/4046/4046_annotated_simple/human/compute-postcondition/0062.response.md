Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all valid `tem` values found that are greater than or equal to `n`, `l` is an even number less than 10, and `i` is equal to `l + 2 * (k - 1)` where `k` is the total number of iterations of the outer loop. If no valid combinations were found, `ans` remains 4444477777.**
