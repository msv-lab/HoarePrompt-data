The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the string `x` into an integer by first joining its characters. The values of the other variables (`n`, `ans`, `l`, `i`) are not directly affected by this operation. However, the value of `tem` depends on the current value of `x`. 

Since `x` is a string formed from the next combination of length `i` from the product of '74', it can represent a number that is influenced by this combination. 

The specific value of `tem` will depend on the current value of `x`, which is not provided, but `tem` will be an integer based on that string. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment and the context based on the current string `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2`, `tem` is the integer formed from the string `x`.**
