Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. The variable `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2`, and `tem` is the integer formed from the string `x`.***
