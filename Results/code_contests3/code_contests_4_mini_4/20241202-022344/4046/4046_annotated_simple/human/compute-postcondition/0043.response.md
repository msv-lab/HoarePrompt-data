According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `l`. The loop starts with `i` equal to `l + 2`, which is an even number. The loop continues while `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l + 2`. 

Since `l` is an even number less than 8, `l` can take values such as 0, 2, 4, or 6. For `i` to execute one more time, it must be less than 10. The next value of `i` will be increased by 2.

If `l` is 6, then `i` would be 8, which is still less than 10, allowing the loop to execute again; the next value of `i` would be 10, which would terminate the loop.

If `l` is 4, then `i` would be 6, and the next value of `i` would be 8.

If `l` is 2, then `i` would be 4, and the next value of `i` would be 6.

If `l` is 0, then `i` would be 2, and the next value of `i` would be 4.

To summarize, in each case, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the valid `tem` values found that are greater than or equal to `n`, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 4`, and `tem` is the last valid integer formed or undefined if no valid combinations were found.**
