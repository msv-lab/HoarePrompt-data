According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `x`. The loop will iterate `i` times, which is currently set to `l + 1`. Since `l` is an even number less than 10, `i` will be an odd integer greater than 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 which means `i` will now be `l + 2`. The variable `x` will represent the next combination generated by the `product` function with the new value of `i`.

Since `i` has been incremented by 1, the loop will now generate combinations of length `l + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `l + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `l` remains an even number less than 10, `i` is equal to `l + 2`**
