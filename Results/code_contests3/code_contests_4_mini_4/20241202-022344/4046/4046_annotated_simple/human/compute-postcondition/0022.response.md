Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; if the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4', then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `l` remains an even number less than 10, and `i` is equal to `l + 2. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
