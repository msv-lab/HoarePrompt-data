The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a string that contains an equal number of '7's and '4's. This means that `tem` will be formed by concatenating all characters in `x` and then converting that concatenated string to an integer. Since `x` consists of equal counts of '7's and '4's, `tem` will be a valid integer formed by those digits.

The values of `n`, `ans`, `l`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation, and `tem` will now hold a defined integer value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the valid `tem` values found, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is `l + 2` (which is at least 2), and `tem` is the integer formed from the string `x`.**
