Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `l` remains an even number less than 10, and `i` is equal to `l + 1`. The variable `tem` is an integer created from the contents of `x`, which is currently undefined, while if the condition is not met, no changes are made to `ans`, `l`, `i`, or `tem`.***
