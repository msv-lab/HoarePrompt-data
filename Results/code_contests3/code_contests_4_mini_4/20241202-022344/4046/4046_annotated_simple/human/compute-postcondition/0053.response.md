The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current value of `ans` and the value of `tem`. The value of `ans` is initialized to the minimum of 4444477777 and the valid `tem` values that are greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `tem` is derived from `x`, which is based on the combination of length `i` from the product of '74'. Since `tem` is an integer, it will be compared with the current `ans` to determine the new value of `ans`. 

As the exact values of `n`, `ans`, `tem`, and `x` are not specified, we can only describe the relationships:

- `ans` will now hold the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.
- The specific values will depend on the initial values of `ans` and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.**
