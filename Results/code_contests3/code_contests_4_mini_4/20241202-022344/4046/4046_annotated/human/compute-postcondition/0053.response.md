The value of `ans` is assigned to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The variable `tem` is 747474747474747474 and `ans` is the minimum valid combination that is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `l` is greater than 10, we know that `ans` is also positive and at least as large as `n`. 

The output state will depend on the comparison of `ans` and `tem`. If `ans` is less than or equal to `tem`, then `ans` remains unchanged. If `ans` is greater than `tem`, then `ans` will be updated to the value of `tem`. 

However, without the specific values of `ans` and `tem` relative to each other, we can only state that:

1. If `ans` is greater than `tem`, `ans` becomes `tem`.
2. If `ans` is less than or equal to `tem`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Since we know `ans` is a minimum valid combination and `tem` is a specific value, we can't specify exact values for `ans` after the operation without knowing their initial values. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is either unchanged or updated:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of itself and 747474747474747474, `i` is 13, `x` is '747474747474747474', `tem` is 747474747474747474.**
