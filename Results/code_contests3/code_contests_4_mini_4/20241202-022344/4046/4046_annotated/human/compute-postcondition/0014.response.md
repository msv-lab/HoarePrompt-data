In the given code, `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. Here, `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, which means `x` is a string containing '74' repeated `i` times. Since `i` is `l + 1` and `l` is at least 10, `i` is at least 11, thus `x` will be a string of '74' repeated 11 times, resulting in a string of length 22.

The string `x` will be '7474747474747474747474', and the `join` function concatenates this string without any separator. The `int` function then converts this concatenated string into an integer.

Now, we determine the value of `tem`:
- `x = '7474747474747474747474'`
- `tem = int(x)`, which will be `7474747474747474747474`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`, `i` is `l + 1`, `x` is '7474747474747474747474', and `tem` is 7474747474747474747474.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`, `i` is `l + 1`, `x` is '7474747474747474747474', `tem` is 7474747474747474747474**
