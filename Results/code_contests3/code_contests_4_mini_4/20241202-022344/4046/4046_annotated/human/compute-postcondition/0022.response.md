Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l + 2`, and `x` is a string consisting of alternating '7's and '4's of length `l + 2`. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is 747474747474 and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
