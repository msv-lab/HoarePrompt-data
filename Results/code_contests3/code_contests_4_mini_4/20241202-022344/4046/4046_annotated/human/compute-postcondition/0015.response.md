`ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`. The value of `tem` is 7474747474747474747474, and `ans` can either be 4444477777 or `tem`. Therefore, the possible outcomes for `ans` are either 4444477777 or 7474747474747474747474, depending on which is smaller. Since 4444477777 is less than 7474747474747474747474, `ans` will take the value of 4444477777. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l + 1`, `x` is '7474747474747474747474', `tem` is 7474747474747474747474**
