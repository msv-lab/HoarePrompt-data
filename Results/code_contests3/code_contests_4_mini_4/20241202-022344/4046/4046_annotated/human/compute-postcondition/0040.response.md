Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `l` is at least 10. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`, `i` is set to 10 for the loop to execute one more time, and `tem` holds the integer value of the joined string of `x`.***
