The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is initially a positive integer within the specified range, the value of `n` will be updated to whatever integer is provided as input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that is now updated to the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is now updated to the input integer**
