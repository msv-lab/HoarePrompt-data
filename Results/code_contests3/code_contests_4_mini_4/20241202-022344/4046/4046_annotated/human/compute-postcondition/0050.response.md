Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 12, `x` is '747474747474747474', `tem` is 747474747474747474. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `tem` remains unchanged.***
