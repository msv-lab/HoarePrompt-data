Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is set to 4444477777, `i` is `l + 1`, and `x` is a string consisting of alternating '7's and '4's of length `l + 1`. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `ans` is 4444477777, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains 4444477777.***
