Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 9 (or any value less than 10), `x` is the last combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, and the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`.***
