According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which determines the length of the combinations generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, and the loop will generate combinations of length 9 using the characters '7' and '4'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 10. This will allow the loop to generate combinations of length 10. Additionally, since `tem` is based on the combination generated in this iteration, it will also need to be updated based on the new combination that will be formed with `i` set to 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 10, and `tem` will be the new combination of length 10 generated by the product of '74'.**
