To analyze the provided code snippet, we first identify the variables that will be affected. The variable `x` is defined as the last combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times. Since `i` is 9, `x` would be a string formed by repeating '74' nine times, which results in the string `'74747474747474747474'`. 

Next, we look at the execution of the code:

```
tem = int(''.join(x))
```

The `join(x)` method will convert the string `x` to itself, which is `'74747474747474747474'`. The `int()` function then converts this string into an integer.

Now, we can calculate the value of `tem`:

- The string `'74747474747474747474'` represents the number 74747474747474747474.
- Thus, `tem` will be assigned this integer value.

The other variables (`n`, `l`, `ans`) remain unaffected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 9, `x` is '74747474747474747474', and `tem` is 74747474747474747474.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 9, `x` is '74747474747474747474', `tem` is 74747474747474747474**.
