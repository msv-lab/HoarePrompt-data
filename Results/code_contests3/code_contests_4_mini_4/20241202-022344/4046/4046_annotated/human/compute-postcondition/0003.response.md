The variable `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is initially an odd integer, after the operation, `l` will become an even integer. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is now an even integer, `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is now an even integer, `ans` is 4444477777**
