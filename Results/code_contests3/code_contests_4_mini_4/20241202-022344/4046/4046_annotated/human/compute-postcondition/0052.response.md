The value of `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string formed by joining the characters of `x`. The current value of `x` is '747474747474747474', which remains unchanged. After executing the code, `tem` will be converted to the integer 747474747474747474. The values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 13, `x` is '747474747474747474', `tem` is 747474747474747474.**
