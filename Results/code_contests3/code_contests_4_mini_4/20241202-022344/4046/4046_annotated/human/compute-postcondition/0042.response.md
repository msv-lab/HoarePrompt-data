Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 10, and `x` is the last combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times. If no valid combination exists, `ans` remains `4444477777`.**
