`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a string consisting of alternating '7's and '4's of length `l + 2`. Given that `l` is at least 10, `l + 2` is at least 12, meaning `x` would be a string of at least 12 characters formed by the pattern '74' repeated to fill the length. Therefore, the string `x` will be composed of 6 '7's and 6 '4's, resulting in `x` being '747474747474' (if `l` is exactly 10). 

When we convert this string to an integer, `tem` will be assigned the value 747474747474. The values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is set to 4444477777, `i` is `l + 2`, `x` is a string of alternating '7's and '4's of length `l + 2`, `tem` is 747474747474**
