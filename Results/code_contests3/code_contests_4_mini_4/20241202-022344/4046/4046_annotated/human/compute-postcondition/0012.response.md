Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`, `i` is `l`, and `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, then `ans` will be set to `tem`, which is greater than or equal to `n`.***
