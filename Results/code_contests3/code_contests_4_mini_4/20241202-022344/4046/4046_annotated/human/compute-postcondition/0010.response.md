The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Given that `ans` is initially 4444477777 and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` (which is a positive integer), the value of `ans` will either remain 4444477777 or be updated to the value of `tem` if `tem` is less than 4444477777. Since the specific value of `tem` is not given, we cannot determine whether `ans` changes. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables without making assumptions about the outcome.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`, `i` is `l`, `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
