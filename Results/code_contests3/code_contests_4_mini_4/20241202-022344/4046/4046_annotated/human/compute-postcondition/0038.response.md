The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means it converts the list or iterable `x` into a string by joining its elements and then converts that string into an integer. The values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment to `tem` without changing the other variable values. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, `i` is 10 for the loop to execute one more time; `tem` is the integer value of the joined string of `x`.**
