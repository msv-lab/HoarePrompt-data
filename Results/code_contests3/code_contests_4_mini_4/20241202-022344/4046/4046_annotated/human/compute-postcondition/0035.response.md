Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` (which is created by joining elements of `x`), and `i` remains 10 if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, no updates are made as there is no else part.***
