The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of itself and `tem`. Since `tem` is 747474747474747474, and `ans` is already updated to the minimum of itself and 747474747474747474, the value of `ans` will remain unchanged if it is less than or equal to 747474747474747474. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` remains unchanged, `tem` is 747474747474747474, `i` is 13, `x` has exhausted all combinations of length 13.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` remains unchanged, `tem` is 747474747474747474, `i` is 13, `x` has exhausted all combinations of length 13.**
