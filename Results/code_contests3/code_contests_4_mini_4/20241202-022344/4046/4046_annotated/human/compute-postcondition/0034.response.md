The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the value of `tem`. Since `tem` is undefined, we cannot determine its specific value, but we know that `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its previous value and whatever `tem` might be. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is updated based on the minimum value between its current state and `tem` (undefined), `i` is 10, and `tem` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is updated based on the minimum value between its current state and `tem` (undefined), `i` is 10, and `tem` is undefined.**
