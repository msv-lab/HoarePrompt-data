The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is already the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `ans` will remain unchanged if `tem` is greater than or equal to `ans`. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of `ans` and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 12, `x` is '747474747474747474', `tem` is 747474747474747474, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
