According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `i`. The loop is defined to start at `l` and increment `i` by 2, stopping when `i` is less than 10. 

Since `l` is a positive integer and can be either odd or even, we need to ensure that `l` is at least 10 for the loop to execute. However, if `l` is initially odd, it will be adjusted to the next even integer, which means it will become `l + 1`. 

Thus, if `l` is initially even and is less than 10, the loop will not execute either. For the loop to execute at least once, we need to set `l` to be at least 10. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is 4444477777, and `i` is `l`**.
