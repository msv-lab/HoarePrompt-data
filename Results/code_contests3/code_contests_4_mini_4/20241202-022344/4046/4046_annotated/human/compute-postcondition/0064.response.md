The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the given constraints, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no parameters in the function definition, we cannot directly associate `n` with any input to the function. The output of the function is unspecified based on the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined due to the lack of input parameters or output descriptions. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is unspecified.**
