The variable `x` is the last combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, where `i` is 12. Thus, `x` is the string '74' repeated 12 times, resulting in '747474747474747474747474'. The `join` method constructs a string from `x`, and `int` converts this string to an integer. Therefore, `tem` is assigned the integer value of '747474747474747474'. The output state reflects this calculation and the previously defined values of the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 12, `x` is '747474747474747474', `tem` is 747474747474747474**
