According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the product of '74' repeated `i` times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l`, which is at least 10. This means that the loop has generated combinations of length `l`. 

Since `i` is equal to `l`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Thus, `i` will be `l + 1`. The next combination generated will be of length `l + 1`. 

However, the condition regarding `ans` being set to `tem` when the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal does not affect the ability to execute the loop again, since `tem` is stated to be greater than or equal to `n`, which does not impose additional restrictions on the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is either 4444477777 or `tem`, `i` is `l + 1`, and `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, which is of length `l + 1`.**
