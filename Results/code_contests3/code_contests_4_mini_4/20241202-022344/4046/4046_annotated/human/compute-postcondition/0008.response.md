The variable `x` is a string created by repeating '74' a total of `i` times, where `i` is equal to `l`. After the execution of the code, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string formed by joining `x`. Since `x` consists of repetitions of '74', the resulting string will be a sequence of '74' repeated `l` times. The conversion to an integer does not change its value. The states of `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, `tem` is an integer formed by converting `x` to an integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is the first combination generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, `tem` is an integer formed by converting `x` to an integer.**
