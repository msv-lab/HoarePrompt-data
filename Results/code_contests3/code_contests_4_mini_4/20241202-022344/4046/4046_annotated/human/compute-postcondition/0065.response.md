Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input `n` and calculates the smallest integer composed of equal numbers of the digits '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such number exists within the range checked, it defaults to returning `4444477777`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. **
