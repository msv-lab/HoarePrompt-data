Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` (which is created by joining elements of `x`) if the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains 10; otherwise, no updates are made to `ans` or `i`.***
