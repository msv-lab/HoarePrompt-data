Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is greater than 10, `ans` remains unchanged, `tem` is 747474747474747474, `i` is 13, and `x` has exhausted all combinations of length 13. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then these conditions hold true; otherwise, the program does not execute any alternative actions since there is no else part.***
