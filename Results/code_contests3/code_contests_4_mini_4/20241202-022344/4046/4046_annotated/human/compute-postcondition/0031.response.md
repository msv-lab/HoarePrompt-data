Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is the minimum valid combination with equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 9, `x` is '74747474747474747474', and `tem` is 74747474747474747474. If the count of '7's in `x` equals the count of '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.***
