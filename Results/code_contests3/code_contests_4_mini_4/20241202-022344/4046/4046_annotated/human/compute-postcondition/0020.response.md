The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value (4444477777) and `tem` (747474747474). Since `4444477777` is less than `747474747474`, `ans` retains its value of `4444477777`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is at least 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l + 2`, `x` is a string of alternating '7's and '4's of length `l + 2`, `tem` is 747474747474.
