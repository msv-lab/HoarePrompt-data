According to the code, the loop iterates over all combinations of '4's and '7's of length `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as the current value of `i` allows for new combinations to be generated. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still the same, and we can generate combinations of length `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, which will allow for combinations of length `i + 1`. Therefore, we will adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must remain unchanged**
