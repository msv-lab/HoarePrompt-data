The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that `n` is a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The output of the function will depend on the value of `n`. Since no specific output conditions were given, I will assume a placeholder since the output is unspecified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output depends on the value of n, which is a positive integer within the specified range.**
