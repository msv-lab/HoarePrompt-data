According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from `l` to 10, incrementing `i` by 2 each time. The starting value of `i` is `l`, and it will increase by 2 for each subsequent iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been equal to `l + 2` (since the loop increments `i` by 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than 10. Therefore, if `i` is currently `l + 2`, then for the loop to execute again, `l + 2` must be less than 10, which means `l` must be less than 8.

Thus, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop will be:
- `i` will become `l + 4` after this iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than 8.

State: **`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or 4444477777 if no such integer is found, for the loop to execute a second time `l` must be less than 8, and `i` is `l + 4`**
