Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or 4444477777 if no such integer is found; if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, and `i` is set to `l + 3`, where `l` is less than 8. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
