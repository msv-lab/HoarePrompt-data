The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value (4444477777) and `tem` (7). Since 7 is less than 4444477777, `ans` will be updated to 7. The values of `i`, `l`, `x`, and the counts of '7' and '4', as well as the condition regarding `tem`, are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is 7, `i` is 1, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7',), `tem` is 7, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`ans` is 7, `i` is 1, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7',), `tem` is 7, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
