Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, `tem`, formed by joining the string `x`, is compared to `n`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The values of `l`, `i`, and the counts of '4's and '7's remain unchanged.***
