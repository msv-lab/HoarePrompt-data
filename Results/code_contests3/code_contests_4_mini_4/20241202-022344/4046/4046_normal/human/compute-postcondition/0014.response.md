`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` can be one of the following tuples: ('7', '7'), ('4', '4'), ('7', '4'), or ('4', '7'). By joining the elements of `x`, we get a string representation of the numbers which is then converted to an integer. Therefore, the possible values for `tem` based on the different tuples of `x` are:

- If `x` is ('7', '7'), then `tem` is `77`.
- If `x` is ('4', '4'), then `tem` is `44`.
- If `x` is ('7', '4'), then `tem` is `74`.
- If `x` is ('4', '7'), then `tem` is `47`.

The other variables `ans`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the possible values of `tem` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 2, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7', '7') or ('4', '4') or ('7', '4') or ('4', '7'), and `tem` is either 77, 44, 74, or 47**.
