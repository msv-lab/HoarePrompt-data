Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, `tem` is assigned the integer value of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
