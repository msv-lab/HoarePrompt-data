Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or 4444477777 if no such integer is found. If `x` contains equal counts of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, while `i` is set to `l + 3` (with `l` being less than 8). If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged.***
