The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which concatenates the elements of the tuple `x` into a string and then converts that string to an integer. The value of `x` can be either ('7', '7'), ('4', '4'), ('7', '4'), or ('4', '7'). Therefore, the potential values of `tem` can be 77, 44, 74, or 47, depending on the specific tuple assigned to `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`ans` is either 4444477777 or 44, `i` is 3, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7', '7') or ('4', '4') or ('7', '4') or ('4', '7'); `tem` is either 77, 44, 74, or 47**
