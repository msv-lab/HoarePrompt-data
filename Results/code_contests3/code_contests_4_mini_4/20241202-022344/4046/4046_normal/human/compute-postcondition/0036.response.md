Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If `x` contains an equal number of '4's and '7's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the counts of '4's and '7's in `x` are not equal, `ans` remains unchanged.***
