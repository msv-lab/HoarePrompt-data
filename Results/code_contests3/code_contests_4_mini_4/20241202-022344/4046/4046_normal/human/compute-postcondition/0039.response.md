The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The initial state indicates that `tem` has been assigned a value through the expression `int(''.join(x))`, but the specific values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is updated based on the minimum comparison. 

Output State: **`ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`**
