In this code snippet, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The specific values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, but we know that `ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is an integer formed by the combination `x`. 

Since `ans` is determined to be the smallest integer satisfying the conditions while `tem` is an integer derived from `x`, the output state will reflect the comparison and assignment that occurs without changing the values of other variables.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its current value and `tem`**
