In the provided code, `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is defined as the first combination generated by `product('74', repeat=1)`, which results in the value `('7',)` because the combinations generated with one repetition are the characters themselves. 

Now, `''.join(x)` will concatenate the elements from `x`, resulting in the string `'7'`. The `int()` function will then convert this string to the integer `7`. 

The initial values of `ans`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 1, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7',), `tem` is 7, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.**
