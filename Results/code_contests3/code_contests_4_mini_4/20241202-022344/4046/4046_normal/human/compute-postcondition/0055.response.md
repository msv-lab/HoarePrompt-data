Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or 4444477777 if no such integer is found; `i` is `l + 3` where `l` is less than 8; if the counts of '4's and '7's in `x` are equal and `tem` (the integer formed by concatenating elements in `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
