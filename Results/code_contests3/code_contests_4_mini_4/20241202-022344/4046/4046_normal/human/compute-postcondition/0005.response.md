According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. The `range(l, 10, 2)` function generates a sequence starting from `l`, ending before 10, with a step of 2. 

For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value `l` must be less than 10. Since `l` is defined as the number of digits in `n`, and given the constraints on `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9), the possible values for `l` can be between 1 and 9. 

- If `l` is 9, the sequence generated will be `range(9, 10, 2)`, which contains the single value 9.
- If `l` is 8, the sequence will be `range(8, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 8.
- If `l` is 7, the sequence will be `range(7, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 7 and 9.
- If `l` is 6, the sequence will be `range(6, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 6, 8.
- If `l` is 5, the sequence will be `range(5, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 5, 7, 9.
- If `l` is 4, the sequence will be `range(4, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 4, 6, 8.
- If `l` is 3, the sequence will be `range(3, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 3, 5, 7, 9.
- If `l` is 2, the sequence will be `range(2, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 2, 4, 6, 8.
- If `l` is 1, the sequence will be `range(1, 10, 2)`, which contains the values 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `l` must be less than 10. The current state of `ans` does not affect whether the loop executes, but it remains as provided, which is 4444477777.

State: **`ans` is 4444477777, for the loop to execute `l` must be less than 10**
