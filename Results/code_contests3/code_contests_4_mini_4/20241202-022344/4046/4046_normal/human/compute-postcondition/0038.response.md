The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The `join` function concatenates the elements of the iterable `x` into a single string, and then `int` converts that string to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, and that `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, the value of `tem` will depend on the contents of `x`. However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. Therefore, the output state refers to the operation being performed without specifying the exact value of `tem`.

Output State: **`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`**
