Postcondition: ***`ans` is 4444477777, `i` is 1, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7',), `tem` is 7, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` becomes 7, `i` remains 1, `l` is less than 10, `x` is ('7',), `tem` remains 7, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
