The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The initial value of `ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or 4444477777 if no such integer is found. The variable `tem` has been assigned an integer value formed by joining the elements of `x`. The exact values of `ans` and `tem` are not specified. 

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` as the minimum of the previous `ans` and `tem`, while retaining the previous values of `i` and `l`.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `tem`; `i` is `l + 3`, where `l` is less than 8.**
