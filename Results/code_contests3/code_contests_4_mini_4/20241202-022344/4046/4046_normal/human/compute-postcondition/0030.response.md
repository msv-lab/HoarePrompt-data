Postcondition: ***`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`; `l` is less than 8; `i` is `l + 4` and can range from 4 to 11; the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal; `tem` is the integer formed by joining the string `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is assigned the minimum value between the current `ans` and `tem`.***
