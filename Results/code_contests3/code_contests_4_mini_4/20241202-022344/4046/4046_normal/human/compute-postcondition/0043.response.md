According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `l` and ends at 10, incrementing by 2 each time. The current state indicates that the last value of `i` at the end of the iteration is `l`, which must be less than 10 for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l`, thus for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than 10. When the loop executes again, `i` will increase by 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `l + 2`.

State: **`ans` is the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4's and '7's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or 4444477777 if no such integer is found, `i` is `l + 2`, for the loop to execute a next time `l` must be less than 8**
