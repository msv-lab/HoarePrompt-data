The function accepts a positive integer input `n` and calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n` that can be formed using equal counts of the digits '4' and '7'. If no such integer can be found with the specified conditions, it defaults to returning `4444477777`. The function does not accept any parameters but relies on user input for `n`.
