Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to True, except for elements at indices 8, 11, 14, ..., 999999 which are set to False. If `i` is 3, then if `a[2]` (which corresponds to `a[i - 1]`) is True, the condition of the if statement is satisfied. There is no else part in the code.***
