According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the length of the list `a`. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` in each iteration until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i`, which is less than 1,000,000. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be increased by `i`. So the new value of `j` will be `j + i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must remain less than 1,000,000 after the increment.

If `j` is currently equal to `i`, the new value of `j` will be `i + i = 2i`. For the loop to execute again, it must hold that `2i < 1000000`, which is true since `i` is less than 1000.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the element at index `j` (which is `2i`) set to False; `i` is a positive integer less than 1000; `j` is `2i`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
