The value at index `j` of list `a` is assigned the value `False`. Given that `j` is equal to `i` and `i` is a positive integer less than 1000, this means that the element at index `j` (which is `i`) in the list of 1,000,000 elements will now be `False`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the element at index `j` (which is `i`) set to False; `i` is a positive integer less than 1000; `j` is `i`.**
