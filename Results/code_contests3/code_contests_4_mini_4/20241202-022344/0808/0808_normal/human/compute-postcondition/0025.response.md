According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to (but not including) 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` each time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, so `i ** 2 - 1` evaluates to 15. The current value of `j` is 23. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 23, and the next value of `j` after the iteration will be `j + i`, which is `23 + 4 = 27`, that is still less than 1,000,000. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to 27.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[23]` set to False; `i` is 4, `j` is 27, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
