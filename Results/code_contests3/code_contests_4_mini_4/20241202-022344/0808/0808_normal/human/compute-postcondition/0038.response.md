Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple datasets of integers, where each integer n is in the range of 1 to 999,999, and counts the number of prime numbers from 1 to n for each input. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine which numbers are prime, storing the results in a list. The function then prints the count of prime numbers for each input dataset. Note that if the input is less than 1 or greater than 999,999, the behavior is not defined, as there are no error checks for invalid inputs.**
