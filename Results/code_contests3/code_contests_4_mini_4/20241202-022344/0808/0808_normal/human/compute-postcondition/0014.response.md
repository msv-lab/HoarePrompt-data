According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `j` is 8. The starting value for `j` in the loop is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `8 + 3 = 11`. Since 11 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11 for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
