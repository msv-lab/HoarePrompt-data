The value at index `j` in list `a` is set to `False`. Given that `j` is 27, `a[27]` is now `False`. The other variables (`i` and the rest of the list `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[23]` set to False and `a[27]` now set to False; `i` is 4, `j` is 27.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[23]` set to False and `a[27]` now set to False; `i` is 4, `j` is 27.**
