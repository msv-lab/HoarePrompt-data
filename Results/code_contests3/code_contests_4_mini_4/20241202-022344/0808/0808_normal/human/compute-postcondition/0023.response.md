According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 1,000,000 with a step of `i`. In this case, `i` is 4, so `i ** 2 - 1` equals 15. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 19. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by `i` (which is 4). Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 23. Since 23 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 4, `j` is 23; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
