The value of `a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Since `j` is 14, `a[14]` is now set to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `a[8]` and `a[11]` were already `False`. The other variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` is `False`, `a[14]` is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` is `False`, `a[14]` is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
