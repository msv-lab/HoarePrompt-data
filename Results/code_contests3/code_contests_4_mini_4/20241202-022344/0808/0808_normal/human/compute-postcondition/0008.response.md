The variable `j` is assigned the value `3i`, which is within the range of the list `a` since `3i` is less than 1,000,000. The code sets the element at index `j` of list `a` to `False`. The values of `a` at indices `2i` are already set to `False`, but now the specific index `j` is also set to `False`. The output state reflects that the list `a` has `False` at index `j`. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the element at index `2i` set to False and `a[j]` set to False; `i` is a positive integer less than 1000; `j` is `3i`**.
