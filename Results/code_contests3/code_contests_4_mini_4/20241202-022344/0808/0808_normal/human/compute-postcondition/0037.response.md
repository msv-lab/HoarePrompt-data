The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it processes multiple datasets containing integers. Each integer `n` must satisfy the constraint of being in the range of 1 to 999,999, and the total number of datasets is limited to a maximum of 30. After executing the function body, the function processes these datasets and returns results based on the input values. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers, each integer being in the range of 1 to 999,999, with a maximum of 30 datasets, and returns results based on these inputs.**
