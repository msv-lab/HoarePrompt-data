The loop iterates through a range of integers starting from 2 up to 999,999. Each time it finds a prime number, it marks all of its multiples as False in the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop are complete, the list `a` will contain True for indices that represent prime numbers and False for all non-prime indices.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where indices corresponding to prime numbers are set to True and all other indices are set to False.**
