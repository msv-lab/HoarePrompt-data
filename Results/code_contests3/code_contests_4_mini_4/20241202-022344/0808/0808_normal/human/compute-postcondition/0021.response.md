According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j`, which starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` each iteration, continuing until `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

Given that `i` is currently 4, `j` will start at `4 ** 2 - 1`, which equals 15. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. For the second execution of the loop, `j` will take the value of `j + i` after the first iteration. 

Since `i` remains 4 and `j` started at 15, the values of `j` during the iterations will be: 15, 19, 23, ..., and so on, up to less than 1,000,000.

To execute the loop a second time, `i` needs to be less than 1,000,000, which it is; however, we also need to ensure that `j` has the correct value for the second iteration, which will be `j = 15 + 4 = 19` after the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is now 19 and must remain less than 1,000,000.**
