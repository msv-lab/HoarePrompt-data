The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Since `j` is 8, this operation changes the value of `a[8]` from `True` to `False`. The other variables `i` and the rest of the elements in the list `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8**
