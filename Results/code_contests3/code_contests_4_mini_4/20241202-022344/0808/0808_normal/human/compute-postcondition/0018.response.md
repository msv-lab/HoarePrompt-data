The loop sets certain elements of the list `a` to `False` based on the indices calculated using the formula `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` in each iteration. Since `i` is 3, the loop starts from index 8 and marks every 3rd element starting from there as `False`.

After all iterations of the loop are completed, the elements of the list `a` that will be set to `False` will be at the indices calculated as follows:

1. Start at index 8 (which is `3**2 - 1`).
2. Then, the subsequent indices will be 8, 11, 14, 17, ..., up to 999999 (as long as the index is less than 1,000,000).

The last index that will be set to `False` can be calculated based on the maximum value of `j`, which starts at 8 and increments by 3 each time until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

The total number of elements that will be set to `False` can be calculated as:
- Start from 8, and the last index less than 1,000,000 that can be reached with increments of 3 would be 999,999 (since `999999 % 3 == 0`).

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished will show that all relevant elements of the list `a` have been modified.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]`, `a[11]`, `a[14]`, ..., `a[999999]` set to `False`, `i` is 3.**
