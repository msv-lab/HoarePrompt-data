According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop currently has `j` set to 11, and it will execute while `j` is less than 1,000,000. The starting point for `j` in the next iteration is calculated using the expression `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) for each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 11. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to calculate the new value of `j`, which will be `j + i = 11 + 3 = 14`. 

Now, we check if `j` is still less than 1,000,000. Since 14 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
