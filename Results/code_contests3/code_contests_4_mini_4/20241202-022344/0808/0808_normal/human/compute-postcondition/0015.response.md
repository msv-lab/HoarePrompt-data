The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Since `j` is initially 11, `a[11]` is set to `False`. The previous value of `a[11]` is not specified, but it is not affected by this assignment. The states of other variables, `i` and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` is now `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11**
