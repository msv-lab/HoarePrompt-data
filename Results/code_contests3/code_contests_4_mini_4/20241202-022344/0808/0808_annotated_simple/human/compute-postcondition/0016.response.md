According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 11. The next value of `j` will be calculated using the expression `j + i`, which is `11 + 3 = 14`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `14` is less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with the element at index 11 set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
