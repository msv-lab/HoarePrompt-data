The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8) up to 1,000,000, with a step size of `i` (which is 3). During each iteration, the element at index `j` of the list `a` is set to False. The loop will continue until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

Since `i` is 3, the values of `j` will be 8, 11, 14, and so forth, incrementing by 3 each time. The loop will proceed until `j` exceeds 999,999.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The indices that are set to False in the list `a` will include all values from 8 to the largest multiple of 3 that is less than 1,000,000.
- The final value of `j` will be the first value that exceeds 999,999, which will be 1,000,002.
- The value of `i` remains 3.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with all indices from 8 to 999,999 that are multiples of 3 set to False, `i` is 3, `j` is 1000002.**
