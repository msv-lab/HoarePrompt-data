According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop starts with `j` set to 5 and iterates as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 2) in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5. The next value of `j` will be 5 + 2 = 7. The loop can execute again as long as 7 is less than 1,000,000.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be 7, and the condition for the loop to execute again is simply that `j` must be less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False and `a[5]` set to False; `i` is 2, `j` is 7, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
