The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple datasets consisting of integers `n`, where each integer satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and the total number of datasets is less than or equal to 30. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value without further information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to handle datasets of integers under specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes datasets of integers n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, with a maximum of 30 datasets.**
