According to the code, the loop iterates using `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` on each iteration until `j` reaches 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so `i ** 2 - 1` is `3 ** 2 - 1`, which equals 8. Given that `j` is currently 8, the next value of `j` for the loop to execute again will be `8 + 3`, which is 11.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 8 and the next value will be 11, the condition will still hold as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 11, for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
