According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 999,999. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1,000,000. Since `i` must be less than 1,000,000 for the loop to run again, it cannot execute a second time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indices (starting from 3) are set to False and all even indices are set to True. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `a` contains multiples of 3 starting from index 6 up to 999,999 that are set to False, and `j` is assigned the value 1000002. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than 1,000,000.**
