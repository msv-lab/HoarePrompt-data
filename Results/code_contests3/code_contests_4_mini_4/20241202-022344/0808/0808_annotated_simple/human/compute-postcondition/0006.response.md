The assignment `a[j] = False` sets the value of the element at index `j` in the list `a` to `False`. Given that `j` is 5, the value of `a[5]` will be changed to `False`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False and `a[5]` set to False; `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False and `a[5]` set to False; `i` is 2, `j` is 5**.
