Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indices (starting from 3) are set to False and all even indices are set to True. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then all indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i` are set to False. If `a[i - 1]` is False, no changes are made to the list `a`.***
