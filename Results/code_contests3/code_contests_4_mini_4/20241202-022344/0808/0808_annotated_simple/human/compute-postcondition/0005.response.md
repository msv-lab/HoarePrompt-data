According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop starts at `j = i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` on each iteration, stopping when `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, so `i ** 2 - 1` equals `2 ** 2 - 1` which is `3`. Therefore, the loop started at `j = 3`. Since `j` is currently 3, we need to calculate the next value of `j` for another iteration of the loop. 

The next value of `j` would be `j + i`, which is `3 + 2 = 5`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 5 after this iteration. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[3]` set to False; `i` is 2, `j` is 5, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
