The code sets the value at index `j` of the list `a` to `False`. Since `j` is 3, the element at `a[3]` will be changed from `True` to `False`. The rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the only affected variable is the list `a`. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[3]` set to False; `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
