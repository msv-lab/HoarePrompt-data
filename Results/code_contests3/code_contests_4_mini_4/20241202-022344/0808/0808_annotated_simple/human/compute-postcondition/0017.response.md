The value at index `j` of list `a` is set to `False`. Since `j` is 14, the element at index 14 in list `a` will now be `False`. The previous state of `a` at index 14 is unknown, but it is not affected in any other way. The values of `i` and the other elements in `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` has a list of 1,000,000 elements with the element at index 11 set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; and `a[14]` is now False.

Output State: **`a` has a list of 1,000,000 elements with the element at index 11 set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; and `a[14]` is now False.**
