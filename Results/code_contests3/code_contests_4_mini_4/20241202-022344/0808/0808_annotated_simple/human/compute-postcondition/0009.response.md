The loop iterates through the list `a`, starting from index `i ** 2 - 1` (which is `3` for `i = 2`) and sets every `i`-th element to `False`. The loop will continue until `j` reaches `1000000`. Since `i` is `2`, the indices that will be set to `False` are all odd indices starting from `3` up to `999999`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- All odd indices in the list `a` will be set to `False` starting from index `3`.
- Indices that will remain `True` are all even indices (including `0`, `2`, and all even numbers up to `999998`).

Thus, the final state of the variables is as follows:
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with all odd indices (starting from `3`) set to False and all even indices remaining True.
- `i` remains `2`.
- `j` will be `999999` after the final iteration since it will increment by `2` each time until reaching the upper limit.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with all odd indices (starting from 3) set to False and all even indices set to True, `i` is 2, `j` is 999999.**
