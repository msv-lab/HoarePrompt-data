Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indices (starting from 3) are set to False and all even indices are set to True. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `a` contains multiples of 3 starting from index 6 up to 999,999 that are set to False, and `j` is assigned the value 1000002.***
