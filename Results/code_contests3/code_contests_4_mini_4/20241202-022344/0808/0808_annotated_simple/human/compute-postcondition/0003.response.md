According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `i` and the range defined for `j`. The starting point for `j` is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` (which is 2 in this case).

Before the loop starts, the values are:
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True, which does not affect the loop execution directly.
- `i` is 2, so the starting value for `j` will be 3, and it will increment by 2.

Since the loop starts with `j = 3` and `j` will take on values 3, 5, 7, ..., up to a maximum of less than 1,000,000, the loop can indeed execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `j` starts at 3.
- The condition of `j < 1,000,000` is already satisfied, as 3 is less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time**
