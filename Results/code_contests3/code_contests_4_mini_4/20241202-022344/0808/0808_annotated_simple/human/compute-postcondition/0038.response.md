Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and calculates the count of prime numbers from 1 up to a given integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) for multiple datasets. It prints the number of prime numbers for each provided value of `n`, accumulating results for up to 30 datasets. The function utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for efficient prime number identification, with the list `a` indicating the primality of numbers up to 1,000,000. **
