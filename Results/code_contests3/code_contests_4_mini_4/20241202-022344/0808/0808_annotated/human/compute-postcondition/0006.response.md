The value at index `j` (which is 5) of the list `a` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `a[5]` is not specified, but it gets overwritten by `False`. The values of `i` and the other elements of the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
