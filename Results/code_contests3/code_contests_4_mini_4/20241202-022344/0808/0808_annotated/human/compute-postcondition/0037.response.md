The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads multiple datasets, each consisting of a single integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`. The total number of datasets is less than or equal to 30. After processing these datasets, the function returns results based on the input integers. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read and process multiple datasets of integers within the specified range and return results based on these integers.

Functionality: **The function reads up to 30 datasets of integers, each between 1 and 999,999, and returns results based on the processed datasets.**
