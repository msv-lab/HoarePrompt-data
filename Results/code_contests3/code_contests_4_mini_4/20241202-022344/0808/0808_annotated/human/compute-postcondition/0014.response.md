According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop is set to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 8 

The loop's starting point is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9`. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) on each iteration.

For the next iteration:
1. The current value of `j` is 8, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by `i` (3). Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 11.
2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must also remain less than 1,000,000.

Thus, the next state will reflect that `j` has been updated to 11.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values, `i` is 3, `j` is 11, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
