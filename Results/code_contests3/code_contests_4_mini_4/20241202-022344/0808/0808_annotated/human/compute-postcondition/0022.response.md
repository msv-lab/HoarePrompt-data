The value at index `j`, which is 27, in the list `a` will be assigned `False`. Since the initial state indicates that all odd indices are set to `False` and all even indices are set to `True`, the previous value of `a[27]` is `False`. The assignment does not change the value in this case. The other variables `i` and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value at index 27 remains `False`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where all odd indices are set to `False` and all even indices are set to `True`, `i` is 4, `j` is 27, and `a[27]` remains `False`.**
