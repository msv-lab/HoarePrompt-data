According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The range for the loop is determined by the expression `i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`, and it continues until it reaches 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` which is 2 in this case.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5. This indicates that the loop has executed with values of `j` that start from 3 and go up in increments of 2. The last value of `j` before the next iteration is 5, and since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, it can execute again if `j` is incremented.

For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 7. The loop will still execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
