After all iterations of the loop have finished executing, the list `a` will contain `False` at all indices that are not prime numbers and `True` at indices that are prime numbers, starting from index 2. The variable `i` will be 1000000, as it reaches the upper limit of the loop. The value of `j` will not be defined at the end, as the inner loop will not execute for the last iteration of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where indices corresponding to non-prime numbers are set to `False` and indices corresponding to prime numbers are set to `True`, `i` is 1000000, and `j` is undefined.**
