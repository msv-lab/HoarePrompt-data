According to the code, the loop execution depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The starting point for the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 2) in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 3 + 2 = 5.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since 5 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute a fourth time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with index 3 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
