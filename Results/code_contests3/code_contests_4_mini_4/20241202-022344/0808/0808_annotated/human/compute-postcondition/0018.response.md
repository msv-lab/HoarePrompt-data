To analyze the loop execution, we note that `i` is initially set to 3. The loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`, up to but not including 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 3) each time. 

The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. Each iteration sets the value of `a[j]` to `False`.

1. The first iteration sets `a[8]` to `False`.
2. The second iteration sets `a[11]` to `False`.
3. The third iteration sets `a[14]` to `False`.
4. This continues with `j` taking values 17, 20, 23, ..., up to the largest value less than 1,000,000.

Since the loop modifies the list `a` by setting various indices to `False` based on the pattern of starting from 8 and incrementing by 3, all values of `j` will be of the form `3k + 8` for integers `k` such that `3k + 8 < 1,000,000`.

After all iterations have executed:
- The final state of `a` will have the indices of the form `8, 11, 14, 17, ...,` set to `False`.
- For the values of `i` and `j`, `i` remains 3, and `j` will be the last computed value before it exceeds 1,000,000.

The largest value for `j` that the loop can compute is when it stops being less than 1,000,000, which can be calculated by solving:
```
3k + 8 < 1,000,000
3k < 999,992
k < 333,330.67
```
Thus, the largest integer `k` is 333,330, leading to:
```
j = 3 * 333,330 + 8 = 999,998
```

Therefore, after the loop completes, we have the following output state:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with values at indices of the form `3k + 8` set to `False`, `i` is 3, and `j` is 999,998.**
