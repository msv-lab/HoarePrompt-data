Functionality: ** The function initializes a list to determine the primality of numbers from 1 to 999,999. It then reads multiple datasets from standard input, each consisting of a single integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999), and prints the count of prime numbers up to each n. The function handles up to 30 datasets and does not return any value, only printing the results. If no input is provided, there will be no output. **
