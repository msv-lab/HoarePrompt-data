The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 3. Since `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, the value at index 3 changes from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables (`i` and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with index 3 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with index 3 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
