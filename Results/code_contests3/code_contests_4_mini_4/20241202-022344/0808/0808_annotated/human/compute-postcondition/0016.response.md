According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 11. The loop starts at `j = i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`, and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) on each iteration.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to find the next value of `j`. The last value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration was 11. The next value of `j` will be `11 + 3 = 14`. 

Since 14 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must now be 14.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[11]` set to False; `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
