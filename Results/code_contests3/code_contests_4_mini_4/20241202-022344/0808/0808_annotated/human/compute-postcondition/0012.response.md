According to the code, the for loop is set to execute for values of `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to but not including 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` in each iteration. The current value of `i` is 3, which means the loop will start from `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. 

To ensure the loop executes:
1. The starting value of `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since 8 is less than 1,000,000, this condition is satisfied.
2. The value of `j` will increment by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration. 

As the loop executes, `j` will take values 8, 11, 14, ..., up to the maximum value less than 1,000,000. 

Given that `i` is currently 3, it is valid for the loop to execute as long as `i` remains less than 1,000,000. 

Therefore, we do not need to change `i`, but we should state that to execute the loop, `i` must remain less than 1,000,000. Additionally, the starting value of `j` is 8.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 8, and `i` must be less than 1,000,000**
