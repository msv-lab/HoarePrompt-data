`a[j]` is assigned the value False. The previous value of `a[14]` is not specified, but it will now be set to False. The state of other variables, including `i`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[11]` set to False and `a[14]` set to False; `i` is 3, `j` is 14.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[11]` set to False and `a[14]` set to False; `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
