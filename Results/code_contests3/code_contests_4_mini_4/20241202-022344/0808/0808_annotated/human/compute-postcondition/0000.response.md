The variable `a` is assigned a list of `True` values with a length of 1,000,000. This means that `a` will hold the values `[True, True, True, ..., True]` (1,000,000 times). No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values**
