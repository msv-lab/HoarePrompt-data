The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 3) up to 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` (which is 2). This means the loop will mark every second index starting from index 3 as `False`.

After the loop finishes executing, all indices in the list `a` that are odd and greater than or equal to 3 will be set to `False`. The loop does not modify even indices. 

Thus, after all iterations are complete, the values and relationships of the variables are as follows:

- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values where all odd indices (3, 5, 7, ..., 999,999) are set to `False`, and all even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., 999,998) remain `True`.
- `i` remains 2.
- The final value of `j` will be the last index where the loop attempts to set `a[j]` to `False`, which will be the largest odd number less than 1,000,000 that is 3 more than an even number.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with all odd indices (3, 5, 7, ..., 999,999) set to `False`, all even indices set to `True`, `i` is 2, and `j` is the last odd index processed before reaching 1,000,000.**
