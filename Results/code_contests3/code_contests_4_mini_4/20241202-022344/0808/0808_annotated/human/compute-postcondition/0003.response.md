According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the calculation of the starting index for the loop. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop will continue to execute while `j` is less than 1,000,000, increasing by `i` (which is 2) each iteration.

Since `j` starts at 3, this means the loop can execute as long as `j` remains less than 1,000,000. Given the current state, `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, `i` is 2, and `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is `True`, these conditions are satisfied for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the values of `j` and `i` are sufficient as follows:
- `j` starts at 3,
- The loop will check `j < 1000000` at the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the first time.**
