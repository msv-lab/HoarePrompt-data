To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the provided program logic.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The function should read multiple queries, where each query consists of a single positive integer `ni`.
2. For each integer `ni`, the goal is to express `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands.
3. If it's impossible to express `ni` in such a way, the function should return `-1`.
4. The function should return the maximum number of composite summands for valid cases.

### Key Points about Composite Numbers:
- Composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that are not prime, meaning they have divisors other than 1 and themselves. The smallest composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, etc.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Handling Odd Numbers**:
   - If `a` (the input number for the current query) is odd, it reduces `a` by 9 and sets `c = 1`. This implies that it tries to make the number even since even numbers can be expressed as sums of composite numbers more easily.
   
2. **Checking for Specific Cases**:
   - The program checks if the modified `a` is in the set `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}`. If it is, it returns `-1` because none of these numbers can be expressed as sums of composite numbers.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Summands**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of summands as `a / 4 + c`. This is derived from the fact that the smallest composite number is 4, and thus dividing by 4 gives the number of times 4 can be summed to reach `a`.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies odd numbers and adjusts them to even by subtracting 9.
- It correctly identifies `-1` for numbers that cannot be expressed as composite sums.
- The calculation of the maximum number of composite summands (`a / 4 + c`) is appropriate for even numbers, as it effectively counts how many times the smallest composite (4) can fit into `a`.
  
### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles edge cases of numbers less than 4 (like 1, 2, 3) by returning `-1`.
- For numbers like 6 and 8, it correctly returns `1` and `2` respectively, which are valid outputs.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly processes the input according to the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
