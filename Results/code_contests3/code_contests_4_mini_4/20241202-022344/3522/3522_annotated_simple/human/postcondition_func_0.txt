The function processes multiple queries where each query is a positive integer `a`. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets a counter `c` to 1. It then checks if the resulting `a` is one of the prime numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11; if it is, it returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the value of `a` divided by 4, plus `c`. The function effectively handles and processes up to 100,000 queries, returning results based on the conditions applied to each query.
