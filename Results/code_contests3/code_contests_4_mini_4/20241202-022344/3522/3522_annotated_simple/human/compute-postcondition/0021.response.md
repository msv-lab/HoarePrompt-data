To evaluate the output state, we need to consider the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `a` is an input string and `c` is 0. If the length of `a` is odd, then `c` is set to 1. Otherwise, `c` remains 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. The code checks if `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. 
2. Since `a` is a string (as stated in the initial state), it will never match any of the integers in the tuple, so the condition `a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)` evaluates to `False`.
3. Because the condition is `False`, we execute the `else` part, which is `a / 4 + c`.
4. The variable `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the length of `a`. However, since `a` is a string, performing `a / 4` will cause a type error in Python, as division cannot be performed between a string and an integer.

Thus, the program does not reach a successful completion and will raise an exception (if we were executing the code).

The variables remain in their stated initial conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an input string, `c` is 0, and an error occurs due to type mismatch in operation.**
