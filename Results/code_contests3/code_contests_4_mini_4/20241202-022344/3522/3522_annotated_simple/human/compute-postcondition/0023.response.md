The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly but relies on a predefined set of queries. Each query consists of a positive integer `ni`, where `ni` ranges from 1 to 10^9. The function processes a total of `q` queries, where `q` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 100,000. 

The function produces outputs based on the provided queries, although the specific nature of these outputs is not described in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function processes `q` queries where each query is a positive integer `ni`, returning results based on the conditions applied to those queries.**
