To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and check it against potential edge cases.

### Problem Description Overview:
The goal is to represent a positive integer `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. If this is not possible, the output should be `-1`. A composite number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that is not prime.

### Program Analysis:
The program processes multiple queries and performs the following logic for each integer `a`:
1. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments the counter `c` by 1.
2. It then checks if the modified `a` is in the set `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}`.
3. If `a` is in that set, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `a / 4 + c`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Values less than 4**: The program should return `-1` for `1`, `2`, and `3` as they are less than any composite number.
2. **Even numbers**: The handling of even numbers must ensure that they can be split into composite summands. For example:
   - `4` should return `1` (as `4` is a composite number).
   - `6` should return `1` (as `6 = 3 + 3` is not valid; it cannot be split into composite summands).
   - `8` should return `2` (as `8 = 4 + 4`).
3. **Odd numbers**: 
   - If `a` is `9`, it becomes `0` after subtracting 9, and should return `-1`.
   - If `a` is `11`, it should also return `-1` after checking the set, as `11` is prime.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints indicate that:
- The program processes the input correctly by checking odd/even conditions and handles composite checks as per the provided description.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the output hints and the code, it appears that the program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically:
- The program fails for even numbers such as `6`, which should return `-1` but would incorrectly produce `1` due to the division by `4`.
- The program does not handle the case for `9` correctly, as it will attempt to calculate and could lead to incorrect outputs.

Given these observations, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
