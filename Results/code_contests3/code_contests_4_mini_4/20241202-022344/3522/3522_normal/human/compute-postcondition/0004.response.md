The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is originally an odd number, subtracting 9 (which is also odd) will result in an even number. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is an even number; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is an even number; `c` is 0**
