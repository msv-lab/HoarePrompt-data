`a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is an even number as per user input, the result will also be an odd number after the subtraction. The value of `c` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an even number minus 9 (resulting in an odd number); `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an even number minus 9 (resulting in an odd number); `c` is 0**
