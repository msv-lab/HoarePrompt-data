The variable `a` is assigned the value from `input()`, which is an even number. The specific value of `a` is not provided, but we know it will either be 2 or some other even number that is at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time. The output condition is based on the value of `a`: if `a` is 2, the output will be -1; otherwise, it will be `a / 4`. 

Since the specific number is not given, we can only describe the potential output states based on the two scenarios:

1. If `a` is 2: Output will be -1.
2. If `a` is any even number greater than 2 (e.g., 4, 6, 8, ...): Output will be `a / 4`.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`a` is an even number; if `a` is 2, output is -1; otherwise, output is `a / 4`.**
