The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, but it does not impact any other variables or calculations. The previous state of `a` remains unchanged and the output does not depend on any conditions regarding `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an even number; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an even number; `c` is 0**
