The variable `c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, and the values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is an even number; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is an even number; `c` is 1**
