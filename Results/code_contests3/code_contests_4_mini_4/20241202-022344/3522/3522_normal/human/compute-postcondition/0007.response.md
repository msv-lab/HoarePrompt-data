To evaluate the code, we need to consider the value of `a`, which is an even number. Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The code checks if `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. Since `a` is stated to be an even number, the only even number in that tuple is `2`.
2. If `a` were `2`, the expression would evaluate to `-1`. However, since `a` is an even number and could be any other even number (such as `0, 4, 6, 8, ...`), we will consider the case for those as well.
3. If `a` is not `2` (for example, `0, 4, 6, 8, ...`), the else part of the expression will be executed, which is `a / 4 + c`.
4. Here, `c` is `1`, so the expression would effectively become `a / 4 + 1`.

Given that `a` is an even number and can be any even number that is not in the tuple, the output would depend on its value. However, since we don't have a specific value for `a`, we conclude that it can yield different results based on the values of `a`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` can lead to two different outcomes based on its value:
- If `a` is `2`, the output is `-1`.
- For any other even number, the output is `a / 4 + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is an even number; output is -1 if `a` is 2, otherwise output is `a / 4 + 1`.**
