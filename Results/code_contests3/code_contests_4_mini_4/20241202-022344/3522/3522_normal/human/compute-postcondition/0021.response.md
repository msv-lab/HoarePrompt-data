The expression checks if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Since `a` is stated to be an even number, the only even number in the set is 2. If `a` were 2, the condition would be true, and the expression would evaluate to `-1`. If `a` is any other even number, the condition would be false, and the expression would evaluate to `a / 4 + c`. The variable `c` is set to 1 only if `a` is an odd number, which contradicts the initial state of `a` being even. Therefore, `c` remains undefined in this context since it is not explicitly provided.

Given these points, if `a` is 2, the output would evaluate to `-1`. For any other even number, the output would be dependent on `c`, which cannot be determined based on the provided information. Thus, the output state reflects that `a` is an even number, and the output could either be `-1` or an undefined state for the expression depending on the value of `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an even number; if `a` is 2, the output is -1; otherwise, the output is dependent on the undefined variable `c`.**
