The code checks if `a` is in the set of prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Since `a` is an even number and the only even prime number is 2, the only case where the condition would be true is when `a` equals 2. In any other case, the condition will be false. Given that `c` is 0, we calculate `a / 4 + c` when the condition is false. 

If `a` is 2, then:
- The output will be `-1` because `a` is in the set.

For any other even number (like 0, 4, 6, 8, etc.), the output will be `a / 4 + 0`, resulting in `a / 4`.

Thus, `c` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, we have:

- If `a` is 2: Output is `-1`.
- If `a` is any other even number: Output is `a / 4`.

Since the specific value of `a` is not provided, we can summarize the output state based on these conditions.

Output State: **`a` is an even number; if `a` is 2, output is -1; otherwise, output is `a / 4`.**
