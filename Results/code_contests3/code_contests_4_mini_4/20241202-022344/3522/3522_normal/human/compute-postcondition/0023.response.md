The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates within the constraints provided where `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, constrained between 1 and 100,000. For each query, `ni` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 1,000,000,000. 

The output of the function is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine specific return values based on the queries. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is limited to handling the queries and their respective integer values according to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit number of queries `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 100,000) and positive integers `ni` (1 ≤ ni ≤ 1,000,000,000 for each query), but the specific return values are not defined in the prompt.**
