To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and its logic.

**Program:**
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

**Analyzing the Logic:**
1. The program reads multiple queries (the number of queries is given as `q`).
2. For each query, it checks if the number `a` is odd. If it is, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1.
3. Then it checks if the adjusted value of `a` is one of the numbers in the set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. If it is, the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`.

**Key Points:**
- The program assumes the maximum possible composite summands can be determined by the formula `a / 4 + c`.
- It also checks for specific edge cases where the number cannot be expressed as a sum of composites by checking against `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`.

**Identifying Potential Issues:**
- The equation `a / 4 + c` assumes that for every number greater than 11, it can be divided into groups of 4, which may not hold true for all numbers.
- A number like `10` is not in `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`, but it cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers (the only composite number less than `10` is `4` and `6` which can't combine to form `10`).
- There is no handling for composite summands for numbers like `10`, `14`, or any other number that could lead to similar issues.

**Example Case Failing:**
- For `a = 10`, the program would output `10 / 4 + 0 = 2.5`, which is invalid.
- For `a = 14`, the output would be `14 / 4 + 0 = 3.5`, which is also invalid.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where the number cannot be split into composite numbers, leading to incorrect outputs.

**Final Assessment:**
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for inputs like `10` and `14` which cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers, therefore it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
