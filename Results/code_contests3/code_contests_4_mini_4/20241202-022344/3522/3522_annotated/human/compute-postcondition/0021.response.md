To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet based on the initial state provided.

1. The variable `a` can be either odd or even. 
   - If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1.
   - If `a` is even, there are no changes to `a` or `c`.

2. The expression in the print statement evaluates a condition:
   - If `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the value of `a / 4 + c`.

3. The final outcome depends on the value of `a`:
   - If `a` is an odd number in the specified set, it will be decreased by 9, and `c` will be set to 1 before evaluation.
   - If `a` is even or not in the specified set, then the print statement will output based on the original or adjusted values of `a` and `c`.

Given that the specific value of `a` is not provided, the output state will reflect the conditions that lead to different scenarios based on whether `a` is odd or even.

Output State: **`q` could be any value; if `a` is odd, then `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, no changes are made to `a` or `c`. Result depends on the value of `a`.**
