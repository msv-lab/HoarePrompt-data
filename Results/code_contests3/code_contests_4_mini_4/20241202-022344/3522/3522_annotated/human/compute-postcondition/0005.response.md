The code assigns the value of 1 to `c`. The previous value of `c` was 0, so after execution, `c` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is the string representation of `q`; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is the string representation of `q`; `c` is 1**
