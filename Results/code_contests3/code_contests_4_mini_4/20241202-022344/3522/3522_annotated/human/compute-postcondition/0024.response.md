Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple positive integer queries and processes each query according to specific conditions. For each query `a`, if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, it returns -1. If `a` is even and not in that set, it returns `a / 4`. If `a` is odd and not in that set, it first subtracts 9 from `a`, increments a counter `c` by 1, and then returns `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`. The function handles up to 100,000 queries, and each query value can be as large as 1 billion.**
