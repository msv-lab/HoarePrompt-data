`a` is assigned the value of `a - 9`. Since `a` is an input value, its specific value is unknown, but we can express the result based on it. The values of `q`, `_`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` could be any value; `a` is an input value minus 9; `_` is 1; `c` is 0. 

Output State: **`q` could be any value; `a` is an input value minus 9; `_` is 1; `c` is 0**
