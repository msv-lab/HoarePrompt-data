The code assigns the value of `1` to `c`. The previous value of `c` was `0`, so now `c` changes to `1`. The values of `q`, `a`, and `_` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` could be any value; `a` is an input value minus 9; `_` is 1; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` could be any value; `a` is an input value minus 9; `_` is 1; `c` is 1**
