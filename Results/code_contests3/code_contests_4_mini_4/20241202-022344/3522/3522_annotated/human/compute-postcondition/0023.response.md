The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it processes a number of queries. Each query `ni` is a positive integer, and there are `q` such queries, where `q` is also a positive integer. The function handles these queries based on the described constraints: `1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5` and `1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9`. The output of the function will depend on the results of processing each of these queries, although the specifics of the output are not provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple queries where `q` is a positive integer and each query `ni` is a positive integer. It processes these queries based on the constraints provided.**
