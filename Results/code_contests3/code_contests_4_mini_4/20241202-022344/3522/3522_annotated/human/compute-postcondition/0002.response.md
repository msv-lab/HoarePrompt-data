The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is the string representation of `q`; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100,000; `a` is the string representation of `q`; `c` is 0**
