According to the code, the loop iterates based on the input value. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `q` could be any value, and the loop will execute as long as there is input to process. The loop variable `_` will be incremented with each iteration, and since the loop is controlled by `xrange(input())`, it will continue to execute as long as the input is greater than the number of completed iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, since the loop has executed once, the loop will execute one more time if there is still input left to process. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`q` could be any value; for the loop to execute a second time, input must be greater than 1 and `_` is 1**
