The variable `c` is assigned the value `1`, which changes its previous value of `0`. The other variables `q` and `_` remain unchanged, and the value of `a` (which is the input value minus 9) also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `q` could be any value; `_` is 1; `a` is the input value minus 9; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` could be any value; `_` is 1; `a` is the input value minus 9; `c` is 1**
