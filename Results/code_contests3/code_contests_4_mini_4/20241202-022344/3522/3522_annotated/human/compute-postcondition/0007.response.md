To analyze the provided code snippet, we can break down the steps as follows:

1. The variable `a` is the string representation of the positive integer `q`. 
2. The variable `c` is set to 1 if `a` (which represents `q`) is an odd number; otherwise, `c` remains 0. This means that `c` will be 1 for odd values of `q` and 0 for even values.
3. The `print` statement checks if `a` is one of the numbers in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints `-1`. If it is not, it prints the result of `a / 4 + c`.

Given that `a` is derived from `q`, we need to consider the possible values of `q` and how they affect `a`, `c`, and the final output.

- If `q` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, then `-1` will be printed.
- If `q` is any other number within the range of 1 to 100,000, then the output will depend on the evenness or oddness of `q`. For example, if `q` is even, `c` is 0, and the output will be `a / 4`. If `q` is odd, `c` is 1, and the output will be `a / 4 + 1`.

Since the specific value of `q` is not given, we cannot determine a single output but can describe the general outputs based on possible values of `q`.

Thus, the Output State is: 
- If `q` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, the output will be `-1`.
- If `q` is even and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `q / 4`.
- If `q` is odd and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `q / 4 + 1`.

Output State: **If `q` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, output is -1; if `q` is even and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), output is `q / 4`; if `q` is odd and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), output is `q / 4 + 1`.**
