The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, and this assignment does not depend on any other variables. The initial values of `q`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` could be any value; `a` is an input value; `_` is 1; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` could be any value; `a` is an input value; `_` is 1; `c` is 0**
