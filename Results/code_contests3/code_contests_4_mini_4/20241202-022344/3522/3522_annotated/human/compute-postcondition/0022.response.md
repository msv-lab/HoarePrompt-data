Output State: **For each query `a`, if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output is -1; if `a` is even and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output is `a / 4`; if `a` is odd and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output is `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`. `c` is 1 if the original `a` was odd and not in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise `c` is 0.**
