`a` is assigned the value of `a - 9`. The variable `a` is an input value, which means its exact value is unknown, but it is decremented by 9. The values of `q`, `_`, and `c` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` could be any value; `_` is 1; `a` is the input value minus 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` could be any value; `_` is 1; `a` is the input value minus 9; `c` is 0**
