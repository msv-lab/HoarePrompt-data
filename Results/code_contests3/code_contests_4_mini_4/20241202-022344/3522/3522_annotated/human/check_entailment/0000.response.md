Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Handling of Composite Numbers**: The problem requires the function to represent a positive integer `n_i` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. However, the program does not explicitly check for composite numbers. Instead, it only checks whether the input number falls within the set of specific integers {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} to return -1, which is not sufficient for determining if a number can be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.

2. **Return Values**:
    - For even numbers that are not in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, the function returns `a / 4`. This is not a correct representation of the maximum number of composite summands. For example, for `n_i = 8`, the program would return `8 / 4 = 2`, which is correct in terms of the number of summands (4 + 4), but for `n_i = 6`, it returns `-1`, while it should return `1` (4 + 2).
    - For odd numbers, it first subtracts 9 and then checks if the resulting number can be represented as a sum of composite numbers. This is not a proper way of handling odd numbers, as there are other combinations of composite numbers that could be formed without the need to subtract 9.

3. **Incorrect Logic on Odd Numbers**: The logic applied to odd numbers is flawed. The subtraction of 9 and incrementing `c` does not guarantee that the resultant number can be expressed as a sum of composite numbers or that it forms the maximum number of summands.

4. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle some edge cases correctly, such as `n_i = 9` or `n_i = 10`. For `n_i = 10`, it would incorrectly return `10 / 4`, which does not provide the correct summands (4 + 4 + 2, for example).

Due to these reasons, the program does not conform to the requirements set out in the problem description.
