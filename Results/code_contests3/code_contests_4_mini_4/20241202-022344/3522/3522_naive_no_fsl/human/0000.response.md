Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the case of composite numbers less than or equal to 4 properly.

For example:
- If `ni = 4`, the expected output is `1` because `4` can be represented as a single composite summand (itself).
- If `ni = 5`, the expected output is `-1` because `5` is not composite.
- If `ni = 6`, the expected output is `1` (as `6` can be represented as `4 + 2` but 2 is not composite, hence it should be `1`).
- If `ni = 8`, it should yield `2` (as `4 + 4`).
- If `ni = 9`, it should yield `1` (as `9` itself is composite).

However, the program checks if `a` is in the set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)` to return `-1`. For `4`, it does not handle the condition correctly, and for larger even numbers, it may overcount the number of composite summands.

Hence, since the program fails to return the correct results for these and other similar cases, it is deemed incorrect.
