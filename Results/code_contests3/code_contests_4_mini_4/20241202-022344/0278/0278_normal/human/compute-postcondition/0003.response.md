The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates based on specific constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `bi` is a list of `n` integers where each `bi` satisfies 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100.

The output of the function is determined by the logic implemented within its body, but the details of the output are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, without the specific output conditions, we cannot fully describe the return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates under the constraints that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), V is an integer (1 ≤ V ≤ 10000), and `ai` and `bi` are lists of integers with specified ranges. The exact return value is not described.**
