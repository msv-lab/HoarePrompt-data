Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `V` from input, then reads two lists of floats `a` and `b` of length `n`. It calculates a value based on the minimum of the ratios of elements from lists `b` and `a`, scaled by the elements of list `a`, and then prints the minimum of this calculated value and `V`. If `a` has an element that is zero, this could lead to a division by zero, which is not handled in the code. **
