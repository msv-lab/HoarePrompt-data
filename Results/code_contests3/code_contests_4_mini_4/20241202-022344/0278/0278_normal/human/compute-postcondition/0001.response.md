The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the user input, where `raw_input()` accepts two lines of input. Each line is split into individual string elements, which are then converted to floats. The first line will populate the list `a` with `n` float values (corresponding to `ai`), and the second line will populate the list `b` with `n` float values (corresponding to `bi`). The previous states of `ai` and `bi` are replaced by the new lists `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` floats from the first input, `b` is a list of `n` floats from the second input**
