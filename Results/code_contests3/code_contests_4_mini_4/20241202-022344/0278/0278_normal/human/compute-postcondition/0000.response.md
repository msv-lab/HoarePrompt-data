The code assigns values to `n` and `V` by taking input as a string and splitting it into two parts, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000. The values of `n` and `V` will be determined by the input provided, but no specific values are given in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `V` are now integers based on the input received, while the lists `ai` and `bi` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `ai` is a list of n integers where each ai satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, `bi` is a list of n integers where each bi satisfies 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100**.
