Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 to 20) and an integer `V` (1 to 10000), as well as two lists `a` and `b` of size `n`, where each element of `a` is an integer (1 to 100) and each element of `b` is an integer (0 to 100). It processes these inputs to compute and print the minimum value obtained from a specific calculation involving the ratios of elements in lists `b` and `a`, multiplied by elements in list `a`, constrained by `V`. The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid input formats or values outside the specified ranges.**
