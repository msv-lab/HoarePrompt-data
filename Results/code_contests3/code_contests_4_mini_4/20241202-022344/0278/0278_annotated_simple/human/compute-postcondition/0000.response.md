The variables `n` and `V` are assigned new values based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which splits the input string and converts the split values to integers. The previous values of `n` and `V` are overwritten. The values of the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 20; `V` is an integer in the range 1 to 10000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is in the range 1 to 100; `b` is a list of n integers where each integer bi is in the range 0 to 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 20; `V` is an integer in the range 1 to 10000; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer ai is in the range 1 to 100; `b` is a list of n integers where each integer bi is in the range 0 to 100.**
