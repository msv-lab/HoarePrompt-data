Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 20) and `V` (a positive integer between 1 and 10000), along with two lists `a` and `b` each containing `n` float values (where `a` values are between 1 and 100 and `b` values are between 0 and 100). It calculates a value by reducing the lists and prints the minimum result computed from the given expressions. However, it does not return any value explicitly, as the function only prints the result. Additionally, the function lacks error handling for input cases that may not conform to the expected ranges or types.**
