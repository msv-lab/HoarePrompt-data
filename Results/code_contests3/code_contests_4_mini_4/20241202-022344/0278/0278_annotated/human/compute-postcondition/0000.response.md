The values of `n` and `V` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which splits the input string and converts the resulting values to integers. The previous values of `n` and `V` are not specified but are constrained as follows: `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000. The new values will be determined by the user's input. Therefore, the output state indicates that the values of `n` and `V` will be set based on this input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20; `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000**
