Correctness: **False**

The provided program has logical errors that may lead to incorrect outputs. Specifically, the use of `reduce` and the calculation logic may not correctly determine the maximum volume of soup that can be cooked.

### Potential Case:
Consider the following input:

```
2 100
2 3
10 15
```

According to the problem, the proportions of the ingredients should be maintained. The total amount of soup that can be made is limited by the ingredient with the smallest ratio of available amount to required amount multiplied by the proportion. 

1. For the first ingredient: 10 (available) / 2 (required) = 5
2. For the second ingredient: 15 (available) / 3 (required) = 5

This means we can make `x = 5` for both ingredients, leading to a total volume of `2*5 + 3*5 = 25`.

However, the program uses the `reduce` function and might not correctly compute the minimum of the necessary ratios and the volumes based on the given proportions, potentially resulting in an incorrect output.

Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly, indicating it is incorrect.
