The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. The code then reverses this string to `11` (which remains the same when reversed) and finds the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives the result 1.

The states of the other variables `N` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the printed value is 1**.
