The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` performs the following operations step by step:

1. `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.
2. `bin(2)` converts the integer 2 to its binary representation, which is `'0b10'`.
3. The string is reversed using `[::-1]`, resulting in `'01b0'`.
4. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'01b0'`, which is at index 1.
5. Adding 1 to the index found gives `1 + 1 = 2`.

The state of the other variables `N` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value of at least 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value of at least 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.**
