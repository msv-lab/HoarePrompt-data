In the provided code snippet, `j` is 2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 3. 

Next, `bin(3)` converts the integer 3 to its binary representation, which is `'0b11'`. 

Using string slicing `[::-1]`, we reverse this string to get `'11b0'`. 

Then, the `find('1')` method is called on this reversed string, which looks for the first occurrence of '1'. In `'11b0'`, the first '1' appears at index 0. 

Finally, we add 1 to this index, resulting in `0 + 1`, which equals 1.

The output of the print statement is `1`, but since the output variable is to be noted, we mention that instead.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value greater than 2, `j` is 2, the output is 1.**
