The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` involves several steps. 

1. The value of `j` is 0, so `j + 1` equals 1.
2. The binary representation of 1 is `0b1`. The `bin` function returns `'0b1'`.
3. The string `'0b1'` is then reversed using `[::-1]`, resulting in `'1b0'`.
4. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in `'1b0'`, which is at index 0.
5. Finally, we add 1 to this index, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`.

The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value of at least 1, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer string representing a value of at least 1, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
