The code computes the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 

First, we evaluate `j + 1`:
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.

Next, we convert 3 to binary:
- `bin(3)` results in the string `'0b11'`.

Then we reverse the string (excluding the '0b' prefix):
- `'0b11'[::-1]` gives us `'11b0'`.

Now, we find the index of the first occurrence of '1':
- The first '1' in `'11b0'` is at index 0.

Finally, we add 1 to this index:
- `0 + 1` equals 1.

The output state reflects the unchanged variables and the computed result. Therefore:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output is 1**.
