According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `j` and the string `n`, which represents a positive integer greater than 1. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer greater than 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `j` will be 2 in the next iteration).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output is 2**
