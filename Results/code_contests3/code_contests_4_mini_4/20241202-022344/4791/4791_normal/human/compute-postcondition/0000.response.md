The variable `n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which takes user input as a string. Since the initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, this means that `n` will be a string representation of that integer value. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input**
