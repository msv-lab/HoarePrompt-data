To analyze the given code snippet, we will break down the steps:

1. The expression `j + 1` is calculated. Since `j` is initially `0`, this results in `1`.
2. The `bin()` function is then called with the argument `1`, which converts the integer `1` to its binary representation, resulting in the string `'0b1'`.
3. The slicing operation `[::-1]` reverses this string, turning it into `'1b0'`.
4. The `find('1')` method is called on the reversed string `'1b0'`, which searches for the first occurrence of `'1'`. It is found at index `0`.
5. Finally, `1` is added to the index found, resulting in `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.

Now, considering the output and the states of the variables:
- `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected.
- `j` remains `0` as it is not modified.
- The output of the print statement is `1`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, `j` is 0, and the output is 1**.
