`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is a non-empty string representing a positive integer, and `j` is `n - 1`. After the operation, `n` will be the integer value of the string decreased by 1. The value of `j` would also need to be updated accordingly, but since it is not explicitly stated in the code snippet, we cannot determine its new value. The output state reflects the change in `n` only.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a positive integer string decremented by 1; `j` is `n - 1`.**
