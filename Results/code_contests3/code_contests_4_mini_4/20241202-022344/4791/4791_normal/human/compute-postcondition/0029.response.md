The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the internal logic defined within the function body. Given that `N` is mentioned as an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), it suggests that the function uses this value internally to perform its operations and determine the output.

However, since there are no explicit parameters accepted by the function and no specific output conditions provided, we cannot detail the functionality based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is based on internal logic that utilizes an integer N between 2 and 500.**
