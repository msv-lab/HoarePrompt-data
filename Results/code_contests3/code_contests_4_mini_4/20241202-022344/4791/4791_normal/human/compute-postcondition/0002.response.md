The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` must also be an integer. The previous value of `n` is a non-empty string, which suggests that its integer representation is valid and can be decremented. Therefore, the value of `n` will now be `n - 1`, but we do not know its exact previous value as it could be any non-empty string convertible to an integer. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string and is decremented by 1.**
