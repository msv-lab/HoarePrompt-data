#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an empty string after all iterations, `j` is -1, and the output consists of the positions of the least significant '1' bits for all integers from 1 to the initial value of `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from user input, which is expected to be between 2 and 500. It then prints the positions of the least significant '1' bits for all integers from 1 to `n`. However, since `n` is read as a string and is not explicitly converted to an integer, this could lead to a TypeError during the subtraction operation. The function will loop until `n` becomes an empty string, but it will not terminate correctly due to this issue. Thus, the function may not behave as intended and could result in a runtime error.
