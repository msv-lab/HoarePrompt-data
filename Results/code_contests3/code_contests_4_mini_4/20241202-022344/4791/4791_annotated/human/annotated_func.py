#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the output contains the positions of the least significant '1' bits from 1 to the original value of `N - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer input `n` (expected to be between 2 and 500) and prints the position of the least significant '1' bit for every integer from 1 to `n - 1`. The function does not return any value and has no clear handling for invalid inputs or cases where the input is not an integer. Additionally, the decrement of `n` in the while loop leads to an infinite loop if the input is not properly converted to an integer, as the while loop condition will always be `True`.
