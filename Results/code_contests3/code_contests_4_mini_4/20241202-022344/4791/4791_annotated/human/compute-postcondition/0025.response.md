According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, we know that `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

Since `j` will be incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2.**
