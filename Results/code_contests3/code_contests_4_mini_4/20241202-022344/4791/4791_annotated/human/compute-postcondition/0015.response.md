The code executes the following steps: 

1. `j` is currently 0.
2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `1`.
3. `bin(1)` converts the integer `1` to its binary representation, which is `'0b1'`.
4. The slice `[::-1]` reverses the string, resulting in `'1b0'`.
5. The method `.find('1')` searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string `'1b0'`, which is found at index `0`.
6. Adding `1` to this index gives `0 + 1 = 1`.

Since the print statement outputs the result directly, we conclude that the output will be `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
