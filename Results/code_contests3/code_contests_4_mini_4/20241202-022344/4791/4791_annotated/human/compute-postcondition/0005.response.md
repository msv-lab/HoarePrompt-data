According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the decremented value of `n`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` has been decremented by 1, and `j` is currently 0. 

To execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `j` is now 1). 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
