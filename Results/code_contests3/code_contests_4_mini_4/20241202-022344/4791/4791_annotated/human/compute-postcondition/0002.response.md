The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a non-empty string, which means it has a value that can be evaluated as an integer. However, the specific integer value of `n` is not provided. Thus, the output state reflects the effect of the operation without revealing the exact value of `n`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is decremented by 1**
