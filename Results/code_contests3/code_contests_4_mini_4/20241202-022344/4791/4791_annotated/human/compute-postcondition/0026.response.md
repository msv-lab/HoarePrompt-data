The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated as follows:

1. The value of `j` is given as 2.
2. `j + 1` calculates to `2 + 1 = 3`.
3. `bin(3)` converts the integer 3 to its binary representation, which is `'0b11'`.
4. The string `bin(3)` results in `'0b11'`. By slicing with `[::-1]`, we reverse this string to `'11b0'`.
5. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of the character `'1'` in the reversed string `'11b0'`, which is found at index `0`.
6. Finally, we add `1` to this index, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`.

Since the other variables (`N` and `n`) are not affected by this operation, the output state will reflect only the printed result.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2; the output of print is 1.**
