To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we must analyze the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and initial state.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is decremented by 1 from its initial value. In the loop, for each iteration indexed by `j`, it prints the 1-based index of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 

The output states provided give us information about the values of `N`, `n`, and `j`, as well as the printed results:

- After 1 iteration: `j` is 0, output is 1.
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 1, output is 2.
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 2, output is 2.

As we continue this process, we see that the output for each `j` corresponds to the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`.

Since `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` inclusive, after all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`. The loop will print the results for each `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

At the end of the loop, `j` will be `n - 1`, and since the loop executed `n` times, we will not have any output for `n` itself. 

Thus, the final output state will be:
- `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500.
- `n` will be `0` after being decremented `1` time for each of the `n` iterations.
- `j` will be `n - 1` (which is `0 - 1` = `n - 1`).
- The printed results will be the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each number from `1` to `n`.

Given that `n` is originally decremented from its initial value, the final values can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the output contains the positions of the least significant '1' bits from 1 to `n`.**
