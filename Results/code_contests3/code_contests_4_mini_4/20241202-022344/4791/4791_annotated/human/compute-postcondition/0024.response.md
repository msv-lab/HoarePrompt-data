The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` performs the following steps:

1. `j` is currently 1.
2. `j + 1` calculates to `2`.
3. `bin(2)` converts `2` to its binary representation, which is `'0b10'`.
4. The string is reversed using `[::-1]`, resulting in `'01b0'`.
5. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string. The first `'1'` is at index `1`.
6. Finally, `1` is added to the index found, resulting in `1 + 1 = 2`.

No other variables are affected, so the output reflecting the results of this operation is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.**
