The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is executed. 

1. The value of `j` is -1, so `j + 1` equals 0.
2. The binary representation of 0 is `'0b0'`. When calling `bin(j + 1)`, it returns the string `'0b0'`.
3. Reversing this string gives `'0b0'[::-1]`, which results in `'0b0'`.
4. The `.find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'0b0'`. Since '1' is not present, it returns -1.
5. Adding 1 to -1 gives 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 1, `j` is -1, and the result of the print statement is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 1, `j` is -1, and the result of the print statement is 0**.
