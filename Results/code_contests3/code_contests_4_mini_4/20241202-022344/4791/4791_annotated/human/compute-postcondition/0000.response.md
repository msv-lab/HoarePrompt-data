`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), but this does not affect `n` since it will now hold a string value. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.**
