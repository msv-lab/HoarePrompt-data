The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is greater than 0, the new value of `n` will still be greater than or equal to 0. The other variables `N` and `j` remain unchanged, but `j` is still equal to the previous value of `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n - 2**
