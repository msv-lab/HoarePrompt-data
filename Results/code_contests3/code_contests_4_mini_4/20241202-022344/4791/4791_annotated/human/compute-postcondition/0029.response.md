The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It will produce output based on an internal logic that isn't specified here. According to the provided constraints, `N` is an integer that can take values between 2 and 500 (inclusive). However, since there are no specific cases or return values detailed in the output section, we cannot define the behavior of the function based on those constraints. Therefore, without explicit return conditions, we cannot ascertain the functionality of the function accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
