According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `j` is now equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again. 

Thus, to execute the loop a second time, `n` must be greater than `j` after the last increment. Since `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1**
