According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1 and `j` is -1. Since `j` starts at -1 and the loop is set to run for `n` (which is 1), `j` will be incremented to 0 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, which is 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will be 0. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 1, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 0.**
