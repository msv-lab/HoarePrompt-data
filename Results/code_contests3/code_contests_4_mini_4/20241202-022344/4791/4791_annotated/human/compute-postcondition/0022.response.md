`j` is 0 initially. The expression `j + 1` calculates to `1`. The function `bin(1)` returns the string representation of the binary value of `1`, which is `'0b1'`. Reversing this string gives `'1b0'`, and then the method `.find('1')` returns the index of the first occurrence of `'1'`, which is `0`. Adding `1` to this result gives `1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and the printed result is `1`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and the printed result is 1**.
