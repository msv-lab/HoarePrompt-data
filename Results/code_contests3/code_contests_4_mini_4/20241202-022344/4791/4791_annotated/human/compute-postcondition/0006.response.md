The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses that string, and then finds the position of the first '1' in the reversed string. The value of `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. Reversing '10' gives '01', and the position of the first '1' (which is at index 1) is found. Adding 1 to this index results in 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the result is 2**.
