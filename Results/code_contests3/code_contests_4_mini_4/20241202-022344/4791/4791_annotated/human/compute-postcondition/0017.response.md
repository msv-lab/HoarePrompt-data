The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated. 

1. First, `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.
2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`.
3. Reversing this string gives us `01`.
4. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 1 (since indexing starts at 0).
5. Adding 1 to this index results in 2.

Thus, the output of the print statement will be 2. The values of `N` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 1, `j` is 1; output of print is 2**.
