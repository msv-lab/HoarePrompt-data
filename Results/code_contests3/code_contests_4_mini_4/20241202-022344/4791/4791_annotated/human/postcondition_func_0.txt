The function accepts an integer input `n` (expected to be between 2 and 500) and prints the position of the least significant '1' bit for every integer from 1 to `n - 1`. The function does not return any value and has no clear handling for invalid inputs or cases where the input is not an integer. Additionally, the decrement of `n` in the while loop leads to an infinite loop if the input is not properly converted to an integer, as the while loop condition will always be `True`.
