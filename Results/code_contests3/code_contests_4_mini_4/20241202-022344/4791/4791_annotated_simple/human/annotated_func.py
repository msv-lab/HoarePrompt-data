#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is the initial value of `n - 1`; all printed values correspond to the positions of the least significant set bits in the binary representations of integers from 1 to the initial value of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from user input, but due to incorrect handling of the input type, it fails to execute the intended logic of printing the positions of the least significant set bits for integers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is not a valid integer or is not in the expected range, the function will not operate as intended.
