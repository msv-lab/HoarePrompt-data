`n` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and we assume `n` was assigned to the value of `N` before this operation. After decrementing, the value of `n` will be in the range of 1 to 499. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer between 1 and 499 after decrementing.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer between 1 and 499 after decrementing.**
