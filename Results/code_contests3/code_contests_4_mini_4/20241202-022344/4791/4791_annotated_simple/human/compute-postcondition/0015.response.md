The code executes the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. 

1. `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.
2. `bin(2)` converts the integer 2 to its binary representation, which is `'0b10'`.
3. Slicing `[::-1]` reverses the string, resulting in `'01b'`.
4. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'01b'`, which is at index 1.
5. Finally, adding 1 to the index results in `1 + 1 = 2`.

The other variables (`N` and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.**
