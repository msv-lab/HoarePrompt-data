The code computes the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `3` (since `j` is `2`). The binary representation of `3` is `11`. The code then reverses this string to get `11` (which remains the same) and searches for the first occurrence of '1', which is at index `0`. The result of `find('1')` is `0`, and adding `1` gives `1`. The output of the print statement will be `1`. 

The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 499, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 499, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
