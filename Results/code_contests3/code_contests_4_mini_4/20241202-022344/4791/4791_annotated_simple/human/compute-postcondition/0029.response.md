The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it is specified that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). However, since the function does not take `N` as an input parameter, it is unclear how `N` is utilized within the function. Without additional information regarding the outputs or behavior of the function, we cannot determine what the function returns or performs. Therefore, the functionality of the function remains unspecified. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output cannot be determined without additional information.**
