According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 499. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `j`, which is currently 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 2 and 499, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement will be `3`.**
