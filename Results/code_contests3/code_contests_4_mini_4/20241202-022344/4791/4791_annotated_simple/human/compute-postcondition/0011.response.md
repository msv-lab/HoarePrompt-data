`n` is decremented by 1, which means if `n` was originally between 1 and 499, it will now be between 0 and 498. The other variables `N` and `j` are not affected by this operation. The value of `j` is still `n - 1`, which will also change based on the new value of `n`. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` will be between 0 and 498, and `j` will be between -1 and 497.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is between 0 and 498; `j` is between -1 and 497**
