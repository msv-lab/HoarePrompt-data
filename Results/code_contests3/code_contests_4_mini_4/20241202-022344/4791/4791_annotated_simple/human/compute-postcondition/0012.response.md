According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The for loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, as the `range(n)` function generates a sequence from 0 to n-1. Given that `j` starts at a value between -1 and 497, it will be updated to 0 at the beginning of the loop if `n` is greater than 0. 

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
