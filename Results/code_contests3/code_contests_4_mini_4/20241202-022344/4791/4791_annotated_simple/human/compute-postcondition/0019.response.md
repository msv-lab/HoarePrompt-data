According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `n` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 0 and 498. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `j` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0**
