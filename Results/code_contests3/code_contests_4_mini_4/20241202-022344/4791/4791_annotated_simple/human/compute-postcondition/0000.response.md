`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will receive a string input from the user. The previous value of `N` is not directly affected, and since `n` is now a string, it will not hold an integer value after this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input from the user.**
