`n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is an integer greater than 0, after the execution, `n` will be a positive integer that is now one less than its previous value. The value of `j` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and now `n` is decremented by 1, `j` remains `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer greater than 0 and now `n` is decremented by 1, `j` remains `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0.**
