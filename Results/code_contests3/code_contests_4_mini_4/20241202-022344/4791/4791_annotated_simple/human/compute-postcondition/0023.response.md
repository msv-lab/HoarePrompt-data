According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `j` will need to be incremented to `n`. 

Since `j` is currently `n - 1`, the next value of `j` will be `n`, which means the loop will not execute again because `j` is not less than `n` anymore.

Therefore, to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `j` to be `n`, and we note that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n` (which is not possible).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is now `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n` (which is not possible)**.
