The code snippet calculates the value of `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The binary representation of `3` is `'11'`. When reversed, it becomes `'11'`. The `find('1')` method looks for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string, which is at index `0`. Adding `1` gives a final result of `0 + 1 = 1`. The print statement outputs `1`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
