Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is now `n`, and since `n` must be greater than `n` for the loop to execute again (which is not possible), the code executes without any loop. The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` evaluates to the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, plus one.**
