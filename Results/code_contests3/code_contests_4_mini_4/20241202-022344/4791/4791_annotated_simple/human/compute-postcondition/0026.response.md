The `print` statement executes the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. The value of `j` is equal to `n`, which is at least 1. Therefore, `j + 1` will be at least 2. 

Calculating `bin(j + 1)` results in a binary string representation of `j + 1`. Since `j` is at least 1, `j + 1` will be at least 2, which in binary is `'10'`. Reversing this string gives us `'01'`, and using `.find('1')` on this reversed string will return the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is `1`. Adding `1` to this value results in `2`. The other variables `N` and `n` remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, and the printed result is `2`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, and the printed result is `2`.**
