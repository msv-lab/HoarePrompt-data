In the provided code snippet, we calculate the position of the least significant '1' bit in the binary representation of `j + 1`. 

Given that `j` is currently 0, we evaluate the expression:

1. Calculate `j + 1`:  
   `j + 1` equals `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

2. Convert `1` to binary:  
   `bin(1)` results in the string `'0b1'`.

3. Reverse the string representation (excluding the `'0b'` prefix):  
   `bin(1)[::-1]` results in `'1b0'`.

4. Find the index of the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string:  
   `find('1')` returns `0` because the first `'1'` is at index `0`.

5. Finally, add `1` to the index:  
   `0 + 1` equals `1`.

Since the execution of the `print` statement outputs the result, we note that the state of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0; the output of the print statement is 1.**
