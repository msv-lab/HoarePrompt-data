According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `n` is not zero. Currently, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, meaning it is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop can execute again since `n` is not zero.

No adjustments are needed to the state of the variables for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 499, `j` is `n - 1`**
