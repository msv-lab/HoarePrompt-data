The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. Since `i` is defined as the second character of `a`, `i` will now be `'s'`. The string `p` remains unaffected as its value is not specified in this assignment. The statement 'YES' is printed, but it does not affect the state of the variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and 'YES' is printed.**
