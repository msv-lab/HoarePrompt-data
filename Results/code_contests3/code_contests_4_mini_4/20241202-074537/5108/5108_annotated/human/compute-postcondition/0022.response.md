Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input `p` with a length between 1 and 100 characters, composed of ASCII characters between 33 and 126. It checks if any character in the string is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If one of these characters is found, it prints 'YES' and sets the variable `a` to 'tstr123'. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only produces output based on the conditions checked. **
