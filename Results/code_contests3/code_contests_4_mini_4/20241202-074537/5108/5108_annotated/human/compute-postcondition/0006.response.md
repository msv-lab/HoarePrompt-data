Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `a`. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', then 'YES' is not printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no action taken as there is no else part.***
