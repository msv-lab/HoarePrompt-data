The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string that contains between 1 and 100 characters inclusive, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde). The string `p` may include the characters 'H', 'Q', '9', or '+'. The functionality of the function is not explicitly stated in the provided output. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific return value or behavior based on the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter p, which is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with specific ASCII constraints. The exact return value and behavior are not detailed.**
