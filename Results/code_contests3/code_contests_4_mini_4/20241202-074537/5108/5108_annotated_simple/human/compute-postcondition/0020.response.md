Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', the loop completes without printing anything, and 'NO' is printed. If `a` contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9', then 'YES' is printed and the loop breaks; otherwise, if `a` does not contain these characters, the loop completes without printing anything.***
