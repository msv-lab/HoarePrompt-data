The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`. The previous state of `i` was either 'H', 'Q', or '9', depending on the first character of the original `a`. However, since `a` is now changed, `i` will also be updated to the first character of the new `a`, which is 't'. Thus, `i` no longer holds 'H', 'Q', or '9'. The output state will therefore reflect this change. 

The Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't'; 'YES' is printed.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't'; 'YES' is printed.**
