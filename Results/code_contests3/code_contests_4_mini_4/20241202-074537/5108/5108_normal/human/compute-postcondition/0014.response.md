The value of `a` is assigned the string `'tstr123'`. Since `a` already holds the value `'tstr123'`, there is no change to the value of `a`. The other variables, `p` and `i`, remain unaffected, and 'YES' has already been printed. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is '1', and 'YES' was printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is '1', and 'YES' was printed.**
