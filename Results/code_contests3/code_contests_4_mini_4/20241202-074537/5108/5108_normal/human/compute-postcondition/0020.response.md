Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is the last character of 'tstr123'. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', 'NO' is printed. If `a` is equal to 'tstr123', no action is taken and the loop continues until all characters in `a` have been processed.***
