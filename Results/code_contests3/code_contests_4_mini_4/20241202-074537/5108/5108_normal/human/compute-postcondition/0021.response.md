The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, where each character's ASCII code is between 33 (exclamation mark) and 126 (tilde), inclusive. The function does not specify any return value in the provided output. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a string `p` that meets the specified constraints, but the behavior regarding output is not defined. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter p, which is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, but does not specify a return value.**
