Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is 's'. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', then 'YES' is printed and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these values, the program simply continues without any output.***
