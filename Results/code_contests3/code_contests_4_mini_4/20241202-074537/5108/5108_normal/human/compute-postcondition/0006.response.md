Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is 't'. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these characters, the program continues executing without breaking.***
