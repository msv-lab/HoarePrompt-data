The value of `a` is reassigned to the string 'tstr123', but its previous value was already 'tstr123', so there is no change. The other variables (`p`, `i`) and the output of 'YES' remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and 'YES' is printed.**
