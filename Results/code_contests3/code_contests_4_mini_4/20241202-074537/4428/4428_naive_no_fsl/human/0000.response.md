Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum value taken by `x` during the operations. Instead, it only prints the final value of `x`, which is not what the problem description requires.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
IIDID
```

The expected maximum value of `x` during the operations is `2` (after the first two `I`s), but the program only calculates the final value of `x` and sets it to `0` if it goes negative, which leads to an incorrect output. The program lacks the logic to track and update the maximum value of `x` throughout the operations.

In addition, for the input:

```
7
DDIDDII
```

The expected maximum value of `x` is `0`, but the program outputs `0` correctly in this specific case. However, the program fails to consider other cases where it might not track the maximum value correctly based on the sequence of operations.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements for every potential input.
