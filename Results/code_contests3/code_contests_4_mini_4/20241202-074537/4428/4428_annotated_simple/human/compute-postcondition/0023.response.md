Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It counts the number of 'I' characters (adding 1 for each) and the number of 'D' characters (subtracting 1 for each) in `S`. The final result is the count of 'I' minus the count of 'D', but if this result is negative, it is set to 0 before being printed. Therefore, the function effectively calculates the net count of 'I' over 'D' and ensures that the output is non-negative.**
