`N` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; S is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**
