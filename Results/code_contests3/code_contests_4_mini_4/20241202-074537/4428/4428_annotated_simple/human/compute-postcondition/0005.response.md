`result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D', `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at the index `i` of `S` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D', `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the character at the index `i` of `S` is 'I'.**
