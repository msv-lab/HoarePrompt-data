Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D'. If the character at index `i` in `S` is 'I', then `result` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the character at index `i` in `S` is 'D', then `result` is decreased by 1.***
