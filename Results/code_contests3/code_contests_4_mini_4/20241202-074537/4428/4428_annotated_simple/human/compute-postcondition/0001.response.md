The variable `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The initial state specifies that `S` is a string of length `N`, consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. The length of `S` is determined by the positive integer `N`, which can range from 1 to 100. After execution, the content of `S` will depend on what the user inputs, but it will still conform to the given constraints.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D', assigned from user input.**
