The code `result -= 1` decrements the value of `result` by 1. However, we do not have the initial value of `result` specified in the initial state. The other variables, `N` and `i`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, since `result` is decreased by 1, we can only mention that the operation has occurred.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < N â‰¤ 100, `i` is 1, and `result` is decreased by 1**.
