The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but it will now be one greater. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 < N ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < N ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is incremented by 1**
