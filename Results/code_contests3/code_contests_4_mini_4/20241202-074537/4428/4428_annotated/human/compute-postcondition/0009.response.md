According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and the variable `i` remains 0 throughout. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1. Therefore, `N` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < N ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1.**
