The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates on two constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S`, which is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. The function processes these inputs internally. 

The output of the function is determined based on the values of `N` and `S`. The function will return a specific result based on the characters in the string `S`, typically related to their arrangement or count. However, without more information about the exact output based on `S`, we cannot detail the return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting of 'I' and 'D', returning a result based on the contents of S.**
