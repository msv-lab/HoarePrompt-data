The function accepts a positive integer N (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string. If the count of 'D's exceeds the count of 'I's, the result is set to 0. Finally, it prints the result, which represents the net count of 'I's after accounting for 'D's, ensuring that it is never negative.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N`, counts the number of 'I's and 'D's in `S`, and prints the net count of 'I's minus 'D's, ensuring the result is not negative. **
