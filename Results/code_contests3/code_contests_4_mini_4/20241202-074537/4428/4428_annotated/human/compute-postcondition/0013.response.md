According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 < N ≤ 100. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`, which means `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 < N ≤ 100, `i` is 2**
