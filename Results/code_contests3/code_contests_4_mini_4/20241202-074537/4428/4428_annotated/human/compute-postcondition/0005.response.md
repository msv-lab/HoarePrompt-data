`result` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, the new value of `result` is 1. The values of `N` and `i` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the first element of the string `S` at index `i` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the first element of the string `S` at index `i` is 'I'**.
