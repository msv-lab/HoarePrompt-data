N is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and the value of `S` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D' remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**
