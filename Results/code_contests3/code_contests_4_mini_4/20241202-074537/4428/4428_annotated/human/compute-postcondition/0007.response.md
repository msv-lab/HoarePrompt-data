The value of `result` is decremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to -1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the character at index `i` of `S` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `result` is -1, and `i` is 0, with the character at index `i` of `S` not being 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `S` is not 'I'.**
