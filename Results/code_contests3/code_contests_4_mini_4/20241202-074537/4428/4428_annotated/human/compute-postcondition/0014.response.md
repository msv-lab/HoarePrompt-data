The value of `result` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is unknown. The values of the other variables, `N` and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 < N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and the value of `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 < N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and the value of `result` is increased by 1.**
