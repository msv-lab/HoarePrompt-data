The value of `result` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 2 < N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 2 < N ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
