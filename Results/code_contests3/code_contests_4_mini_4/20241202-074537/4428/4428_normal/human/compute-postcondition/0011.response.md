The `result` variable is decremented by 1. However, the initial value of `result` is unknown based on the provided information, and we only know that `N` is a positive integer (1 to 100) and `i` is initialized to 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `result` is decreased by 1, but the specific value cannot be determined.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 1, and `result` is decreased by 1**.
