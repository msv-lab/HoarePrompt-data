According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, it is guaranteed that `i` is less than `N` (as long as `N` is at least 1). When the loop executes again, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will become 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
