According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and since `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increase by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently at its maximum value just before `N`, it will need to be incremented.

If the loop has executed `N` times, `i` would be `N-1` after the last iteration. Thus, the next value of `i` for the loop to execute again would be `N`, and so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be equal to `N`, which would mean the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than N.**
