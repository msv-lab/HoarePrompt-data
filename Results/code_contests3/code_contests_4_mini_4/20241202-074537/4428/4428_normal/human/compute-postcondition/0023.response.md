Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It counts the occurrences of 'I' and 'D', calculating the difference between them. If the difference (result) is negative, it is set to 0 before being printed. Therefore, the function outputs the count of 'I's minus the count of 'D's, ensuring the output is never less than 0. **
