The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The variable `result` was previously unknown, but it is now increased by 1. The other variables `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, `i` is 0, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, `i` is 0, and `result` is increased by 1.**
