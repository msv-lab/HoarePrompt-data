The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `result` is not provided, but it is affected by this operation. The variables `N` and `i` are not changed or impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `result`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `i` is less than `N`; `result` is decreased by 1.**
