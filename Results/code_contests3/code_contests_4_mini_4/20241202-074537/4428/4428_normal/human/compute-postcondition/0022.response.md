The function `func` does not accept any explicit parameters but operates with two constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S`, which is a string of length N containing only the characters 'I' (for increasing) and 'D' (for decreasing). The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. 

Since the function is designed to work based on these constraints, we can infer the functionality based on the nature of `S`.

Functionality: **The function processes a string S of length N (where N is a positive integer between 1 and 100) consisting of the characters 'I' and 'D', performing actions based on the sequence of these characters, though the specific output is not detailed.**
