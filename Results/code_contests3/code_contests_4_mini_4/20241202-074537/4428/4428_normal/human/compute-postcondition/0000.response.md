`N` is reassigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is defined as a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, the new value of `N` will still satisfy this condition. The state of the variable `S` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100 and `S` is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100; `S` is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'.**
