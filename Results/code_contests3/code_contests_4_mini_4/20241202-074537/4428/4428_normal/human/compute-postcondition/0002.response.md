The variable `result` is initialized to `0`. The states of the other variables, `N` and `S`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100; `S` is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'; `result` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100; `S` is a string of length N containing only 'I' and 'D'; `result` is 0**
