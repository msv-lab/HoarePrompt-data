Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and reads a ticket number consisting of exactly `n` digits, which are expected to be either 4 or 7. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not validate that the digits are strictly 4 or 7, which is a potential edge case.**
