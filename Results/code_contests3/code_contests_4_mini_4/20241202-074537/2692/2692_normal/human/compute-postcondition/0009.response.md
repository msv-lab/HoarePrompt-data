The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the ticket number is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits, which consists only of the digits 4 and 7. The output is determined based on the ticket number provided according to these constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to validate a ticket number based on the specified conditions regarding the number of digits and the digits themselves. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a ticket number that is a positive integer with exactly n digits (where n is an even integer between 2 and 50) consisting only of the digits 4 and 7, and performs validation based on these criteria.**
