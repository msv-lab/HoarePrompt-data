Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `digits` is a map object representing a list of integers from input. The sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (up to n / 2) is equal to the sum of the second half of the elements in `digits` (from n / 2 + n % 2 to the end).***
