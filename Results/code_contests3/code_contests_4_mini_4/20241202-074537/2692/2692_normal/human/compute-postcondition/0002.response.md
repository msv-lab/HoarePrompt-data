The `digits` variable is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().strip())`, which means it will contain a map object that converts the input string (after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace) into integers. The variable `n` is not directly affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `digits` is a map object representing a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; `digits` is a map object representing a list of integers from input.**
