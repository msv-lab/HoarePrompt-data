To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to check for the following conditions:

1. The ticket number must consist only of the digits 4 and 7 (i.e., it must be a lucky number).
2. The sum of the first half of the digits must equal the sum of the second half.

Now, let's examine the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())
    if sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if all the digits in the ticket number are either 4 or 7. It only checks the sums of the halves. If the ticket number contains digits other than 4 or 7, it should immediately return "NO", but it does not do so.

2. **Incorrect Slicing**: The line where it sums the second half of the digits is incorrect. The expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` will incorrectly skip the first digit of the second half when `n` is even. The correct slicing should be `digits[n / 2:]`.

### Potential Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
1234
```
- The expected output should be "NO" because it is not a lucky number and it does not satisfy the lucky number criteria.
- The program will incorrectly sum the halves and output "NO", but it will not correctly identify that the number is not a lucky number.

Another example:
```
4
4747
```
- The expected output should be "YES" because it is a lucky number and the sums are equal (4 = 4).
- If the ticket number was instead `4748`, the expected output should be "NO" as it contains a digit that is not 4 or 7, but the program would incorrectly output "YES" based on the sums.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case where the number is not a lucky number, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
