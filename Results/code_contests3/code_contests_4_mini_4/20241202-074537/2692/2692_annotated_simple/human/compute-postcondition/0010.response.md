Functionality: ** The function reads an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a sequence of `n` digits (which must be either 4 or 7). It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If the sums are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept parameters and relies on user input for `n` and the digits.**
