The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraints that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the ticket number is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits, which contains only the digits 4 and 7. Based on these constraints, the function would evaluate the ticket number and produce a specific output. However, since the exact logic is not provided, we will focus on the defined constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates on an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number that is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits, containing only the digits 4 and 7.**
