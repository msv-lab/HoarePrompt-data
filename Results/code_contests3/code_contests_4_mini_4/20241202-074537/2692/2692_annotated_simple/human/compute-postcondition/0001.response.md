The variable `n` is assigned the value from `raw_input().strip()`, which takes user input, removes any surrounding whitespace, and converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, the value of `n` will now be specifically that input integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is the input even integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is the input even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
