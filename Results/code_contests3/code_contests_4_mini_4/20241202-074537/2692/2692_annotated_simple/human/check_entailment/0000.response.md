Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check whether the ticket number consists exclusively of the lucky digits 4 and 7. The problem description specifies that a ticket must be a lucky number, meaning it should only contain the digits 4 and 7. However, the program directly proceeds to sum the digits without verifying if all digits are either 4 or 7.

2. **Incorrect Indexing**: In the line where the program compares the sums of the two halves of the ticket number, the indexing is incorrect:
   ```python
   if (sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:])) :
   ```
   Here, `n / 2 + n % 2` is incorrect for even `n`. It should simply be `n / 2`, as this would account for the two equal halves of the ticket number. The correct expression should be:
   ```python
   if (sum(digits[:n // 2]) == sum(digits[n // 2:])) :
   ```

3. **Input Handling for Digits**: The way the ticket number is processed into digits is incorrect. The `map(int, raw_input().strip())` will read each character as a separate integer, but this needs to be clarified in terms of its structure and type. The program should ensure that the ticket number is treated as a string to verify its lucky digits before attempting to convert them into integers for summation.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct as it does not fully implement the required checks for the ticket to be classified as lucky according to the problem description.
