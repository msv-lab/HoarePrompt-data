Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The problem states that a ticket number must be a lucky number, which means it should only consist of the digits 4 and 7. The program does not check if the ticket number contains any digits other than 4 or 7. Therefore, a ticket number like "4738" would pass through without any check, even though it is not a lucky number.

2. **Sum Calculation Error**: The program attempts to calculate the sums of the two halves of the digits using the expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]`. This expression is incorrect because it does not correctly slice the second half of the list of digits. The correct slicing for the second half should be `digits[n // 2:]`, since we want to start from the midpoint and go to the end. 

3. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). Additionally, it does not properly handle any leading zeros in the ticket number as required by the problem statement.

Overall, the program fails to validate the lucky number criteria and contains a slicing error that compromises the sum checking functionality. Hence, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
