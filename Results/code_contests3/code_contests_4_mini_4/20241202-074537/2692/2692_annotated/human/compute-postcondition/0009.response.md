The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on a ticket number that is a positive integer represented as a string of exactly `n` digits, where `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. After executing the function body, it evaluates the ticket number, which contains only the digits 4 and 7. The specific output of the function is not described in the provided information, but it can be inferred that it works with the ticket number based on the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a ticket number represented as a string of exactly n digits (where n is an even integer between 2 and 50) containing only the digits 4 and 7.**
