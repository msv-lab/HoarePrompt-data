Functionality: ** The function reads an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of exactly `n` digits containing only the digits 4 and 7. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half, printing 'YES' if they are equal and 'NO' otherwise. It should be noted that the code does not handle invalid input cases (e.g., if the digits contain numbers other than 4 and 7, or if the input string is not exactly `n` digits long). **
