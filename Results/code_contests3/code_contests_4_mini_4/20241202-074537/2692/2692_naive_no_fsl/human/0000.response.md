Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly determine if a ticket number is "lucky." Here are the issues:

1. **Lucky Numbers Check**: The program does not check if all digits in the ticket number are lucky digits (4 or 7). A number is only considered lucky if it consists solely of the digits 4 and 7. For example, the input "4738" should be evaluated as not lucky because it contains the digit '8', but the program does not perform this check.

2. **Sum Comparison Logic**: The program incorrectly slices the digits when calculating the sum of the two halves. The correct slices should be `digits[:n // 2]` for the first half and `digits[n // 2:]` for the second half. The current logic mistakenly uses `n / 2 + n % 2`, which does not correctly represent the second half of the string.

Given these flaws, the program will not work correctly for inputs that do not consist solely of lucky digits or when summing the halves, leading to potential incorrect outputs. 

For example, for the input:
```
4
1234
```
The expected output should be "NO" since 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not lucky digits, but the program doesn't check for lucky digits at all and would incorrectly compare sums, leading to a potential output of "YES" or "NO" based on that faulty logic. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
