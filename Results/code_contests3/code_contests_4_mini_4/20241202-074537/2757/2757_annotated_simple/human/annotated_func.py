#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'ch' is a consonant (not in 'aeiou') and False if 'ch' is a vowel (in 'aeiou')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns True if `ch` is a consonant (not one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'); otherwise, it returns False if `ch` is a vowel. It does not handle cases where `ch` is not a single character or is outside the specified character range, as the function assumes `ch` is a single lowercase letter.
