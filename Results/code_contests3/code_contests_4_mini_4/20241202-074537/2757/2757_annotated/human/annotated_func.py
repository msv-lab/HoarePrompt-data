#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'ch' is a consonant (not in 'aeiou'), and False if 'ch' is a vowel (in 'aeiou').
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which is expected to be a single character consisting of a lowercase English letter. It returns True if `ch` is a consonant (i.e., not one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), and False if `ch` is a vowel. However, the function does not handle cases where the input string has more than one character or is not a lowercase English letter.
