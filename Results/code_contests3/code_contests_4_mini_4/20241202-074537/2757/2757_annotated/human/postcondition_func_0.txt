The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which is expected to be a single character consisting of a lowercase English letter. It returns True if `ch` is a consonant (i.e., not one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), and False if `ch` is a vowel. However, the function does not handle cases where the input string has more than one character or is not a lowercase English letter.
