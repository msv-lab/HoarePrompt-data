Correctness: **False**

The annotated program only includes a single function `func_1(ch)` that checks whether a given character is a consonant or a vowel. This function does not implement the required functionality of checking for typos in a word, which involves detecting blocks of three or more consonants in a row that are not made up of the same letter. 

The problem description requires the entire word to be processed to identify typos and potentially insert spaces to separate the word into valid segments. However, the provided code does not perform any operations on the entire word, nor does it handle the logic for splitting the word into valid segments based on the typo criteria.

In summary, the program is incomplete and does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. It fails to check for consecutive consonants, does not account for exceptions, and does not modify the word to remove typos.
