The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns True if `ch` is a consonant (i.e., not one of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). It returns False if `ch` is a vowel. However, the function does not handle cases where `ch` may contain more than one character, as it only checks the presence of the single string `ch` in the list of vowels. Additionally, it assumes that `ch` is a single character. If `ch` is not a single character, the behavior is undefined.
