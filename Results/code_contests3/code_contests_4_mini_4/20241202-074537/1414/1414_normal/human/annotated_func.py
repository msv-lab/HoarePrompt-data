#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0 (if `b` was greater than 0), `res` is the total number of iterations until `a` became non-positive, and `k`, `v` remain unchanged as integers (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k` (the maximum number of sections in a box), `a` (the number of nuts), `b` (the number of divisors), and `v` (the capacity of each section of the box). It calculates the total number of iterations needed to reduce the number of nuts (`a`) to zero or below, while adjusting `a` based on the values of `b` and `k` in each iteration. It returns the total iterations as the output. Note that if `b` is zero, it only reduces `a` by `v` in each iteration, and if `b` is positive, it reduces `a` by `k * v` or `(b + 1) * v` depending on the condition.
