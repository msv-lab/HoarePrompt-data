The value of `b` is assigned 0. The other variables, `k`, `a`, `v`, and `res`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer, `a` is reduced by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0, `v` is an integer, `res` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `a` is reduced by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0, `v` is an integer, `res` is 1**
