The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. The value of `k` is an integer in the range of 2 to 1000, so the value of `(k - 1)` can range from 1 to 999. However, the previous value of `b` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `b`. The values of `res`, `a`, and `v` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1).

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1)**
