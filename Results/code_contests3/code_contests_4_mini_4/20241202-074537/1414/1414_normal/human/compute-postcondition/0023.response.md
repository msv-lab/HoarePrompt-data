Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 1000). If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by (k - 1), and `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains an integer, and `res` is also increased by 1.***
