Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a`, `b`, `v`, and `res` are integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is set to 1. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` is reduced by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `b` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is reduced by `v`.***
