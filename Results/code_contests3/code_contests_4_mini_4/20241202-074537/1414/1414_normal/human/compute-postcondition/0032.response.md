Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `b` is decreased by (k - 1). If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is modified by subtracting (b + 1) * v from its previous value and `b` is set to 0; otherwise, `a` is decremented by `v`.***
