Postcondition: ***`k`, `a` are adjusted to be greater than 0. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by (k - 1), while `v` remains unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is less than `k`, then `k` is greater than 0 and `a` is adjusted to be greater than 0 if `b` is greater than 0; if `b` is 0, then `a` is adjusted to `a - v`. In both cases, `b` and `v` remain unchanged, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
