Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, and `res` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` remains 1. Otherwise, `a` is modified by subtracting `v`, while `b` remains inconsistent with its initial state.***
