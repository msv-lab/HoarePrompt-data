Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, and `res` are integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is decreased by at least 1 while remaining greater than or equal to 1, and `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated and `b` is set to 0, with `res` incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains an integer with 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
