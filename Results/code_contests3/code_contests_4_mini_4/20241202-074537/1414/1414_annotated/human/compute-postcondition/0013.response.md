Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, and `res` are integers. If `b` > 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` remains 1. Otherwise, `a` is modified by subtracting `v`, while `b` remains inconsistent with its initial state. In both cases, `k` is within the range (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), and `v` is within the range (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).***
