#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to the initial value of `b`, `k` and `v` remain unchanged, and `res` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is at least 1.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k` (the maximum number of sections in a box), `a` (the number of nuts), `b` (the number of divisors), and `v` (the capacity of each section of the box). It calculates how many iterations are needed to distribute the nuts based on the available sections and divisors. Each iteration corresponds to a distribution of nuts until all nuts are distributed (when `a` is reduced to zero or below). The function returns the total number of iterations taken to distribute all the nuts. If there are not enough divisors or sections to accommodate the nuts, the iteration logic adjusts accordingly, accommodating the available resources.
