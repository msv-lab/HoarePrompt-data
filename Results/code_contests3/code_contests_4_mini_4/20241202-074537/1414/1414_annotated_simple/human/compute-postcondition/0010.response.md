The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `b` was a positive integer between 1 and 1000, so now `b` no longer meets its previous condition of being positive. Other variables (`k`, `a`, `v`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0, `v` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `res` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is 0, `v` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `res` is 1**
