Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000; if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, remaining greater than or equal to `k`, while `v` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than `k` and greater than 0, then `b` remains greater than 0 and `a` must still be greater than 0. If `b` is equal to 0, then `b` is 0, `a` is decremented by `v`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
