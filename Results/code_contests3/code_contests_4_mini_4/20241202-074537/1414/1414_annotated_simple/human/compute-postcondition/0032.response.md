Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `b` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by `k - 1`, `a` is updated to `a - k * v`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`.***
