Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000; if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `v` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000. If `b` is greater than 0 but less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - v`, while both `b` and `v` remain positive integers between 1 and 1000, and `res` remains 1.***
