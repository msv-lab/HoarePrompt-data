#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer between 2 and 1000, a is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), b is a positive integer representing the number of divisors (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and v is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`, `res` is the number of iterations executed, `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `v` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, processes the number of nuts `a` based on the number of divisors `b` and the integer `k`, and prints the total number of iterations required to process all nuts until `a` is less than or equal to 0.
