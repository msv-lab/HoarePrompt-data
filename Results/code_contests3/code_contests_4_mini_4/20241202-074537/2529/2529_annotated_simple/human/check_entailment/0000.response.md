Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key reasons:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program attempts to read jump coordinates as floats using `e = float(input())`. However, the input should be parsed as arithmetic expressions in the format "(a+b)/c", which are strings, and then evaluated to compute the result of the expression. The current implementation does not evaluate the expression but rather tries to convert it directly to a float, which will not work correctly since the input is in a string format.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program lacks the logic to properly parse and evaluate the arithmetic expression "(a+b)/c". The correct approach would involve extracting the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the string input and performing the arithmetic operation to get the resulting coordinate.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: While the program uses `test_list.count(i)` to count occurrences, this is inefficient for large inputs due to its O(n) complexity for each count operation. This could lead to a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, which is unacceptable given the input constraints (up to 200,000 ships).

4. **Output Format**: The program does eventually print the counts in the required format, but without correctly computing the coordinates first, the counts will be incorrect.

Overall, the program fails to meet the problem requirements because it does not correctly parse and evaluate the input expressions, leading to incorrect results.
