The function accepts an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) and reads `m` float values from input. It counts the occurrences of each float in the list and returns a space-separated string of these counts. The function does not process any ship jump coordinates as described in the annotations, and it assumes valid float inputs are provided.
