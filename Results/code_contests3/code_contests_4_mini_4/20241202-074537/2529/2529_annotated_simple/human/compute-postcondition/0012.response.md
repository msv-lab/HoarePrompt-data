`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000; `test_list` contains `m` float inputs; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000; `test_list` contains `m` float inputs; `i` is equal to `m` after the loop completes; `my_list` is an empty list.**
