The variable `my_list` is updated by appending the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. Since `i` is the third float in `test_list`, its count will depend on the values present in `test_list`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the updated `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000, `test_list` contains at least 3 floats, `i` is the third float in `test_list`, `my_list` includes the count of occurrences of the first float in `test_list`, and `my_list` is updated by appending the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`.**
