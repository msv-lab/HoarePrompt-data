The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user within the specified range of 1 to 200000. The previous state of `m` is not affected since it is being reassigned a new value. The output state will reflect that `m` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000**
