According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once because `m` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Since `test_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
