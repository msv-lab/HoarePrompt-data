The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state does not mention the previous values of `test_list`, but since `e` is a float input, it will be added to `test_list`. The values of other variables (`m` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes `e.**
