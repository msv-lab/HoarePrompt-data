The value of `e` is appended to the `test_list`. The previous values of `m`, `i`, and `e` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000; `i` is 2; `e` is a float input; and `e` is appended to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer within the range 1 to 200000; `i` is 2; `e` is a float input; and `e` is appended to `test_list`.**
