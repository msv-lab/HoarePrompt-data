The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes an integer `m` which is constrained to be between 1 and 200,000, and it operates on ship jump coordinates given as strings formatted as "(a+b)/c", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The function ultimately returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle an integer `m` within the specified range and to process ship jump coordinates formatted as strings, returning a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) and ship jump coordinates given as strings in the format "(a+b)/c", where a, b, and c are positive integers, returning a result based on these inputs.**
