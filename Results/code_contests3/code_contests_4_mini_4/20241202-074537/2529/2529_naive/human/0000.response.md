Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly parse the arithmetic expressions as described in the problem statement. Instead of evaluating the given expressions of the form `(a+b)/c`, the program is mistakenly reading the input as floating-point numbers directly. This means the program will fail to compute the actual jump coordinates based on the arithmetic expressions.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7
```
The program will not correctly interpret the expressions and will not compute the expected coordinates. Instead, it will treat the input as raw floats, which will not yield the correct outputs for the jumping coordinates. 

The correct output should be the counts of ships landing at the same coordinates after evaluating the expressions, but the current implementation does not handle the evaluation at all. Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
