Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the input format described in the problem statement. The input expressions are supposed to be in the form of `(a+b)/c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. However, the program reads the input directly as a float, which will not work as intended since it does not parse the arithmetic expression correctly.

For example, if we input:
```
1
(99+1)/100
```
The program will attempt to convert the string `(99+1)/100` to a float, which will result in an error or an incorrect value. The program should instead evaluate the expression to compute the float value of the coordinate.

Moreover, the program uses `test_list.count(i)` to count how many ships have the same coordinates. This method is not efficient and does not guarantee correctness since it relies on the floating-point representation, which can lead to precision errors.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements as outlined in the problem description, particularly in evaluating the arithmetic expressions and counting occurrences of the resulting coordinates.
