Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads input as a float directly using `float(input())`. However, the input is expected to be in the form of an arithmetic expression "(a+b)/c" as a string. The program should be parsing this string to evaluate the expression instead of attempting to read it as a float directly.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The problem requires calculating the result of the expression "(a+b)/c" for each ship, but the program does not evaluate the expression. Instead, it tries to convert the input directly to a float without any parsing or calculation.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses `test_list.count(i)` to count occurrences of each float value in the list. However, since the input is not correctly evaluated as needed, the counts will not reflect the correct number of ships that end up at the same coordinate based on the evaluated expression.

4. **Output Format**: The output should be a space-separated list of integers representing the counts of ships at the same coordinate, which the program aims to do, but since the counts are based on incorrect values, it will not produce the correct result.

In summary, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly parse, evaluate, and count the results of the given arithmetic expressions.
