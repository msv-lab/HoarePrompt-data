The value of `my_list` is updated by appending the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The previous values of `i` and `test_list` determine the output state. Since it is stated that the loop executes a third time, it is implied that `test_list` contains at least 3 elements, and therefore the count can be calculated. However, the specific values of `i` and the count of `i` in `test_list` are not provided. 

Thus, the output state reflects the operation performed without knowing the specific counts or values. 

Output State: **`my_list` is updated by appending the count of `i` in `test_list`, and `test_list` has at least 3 elements**.
