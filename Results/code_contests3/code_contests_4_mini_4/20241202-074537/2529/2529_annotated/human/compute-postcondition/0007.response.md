The variable `test_list` is updated by appending the value of `e` to it. The previous states of `m` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e.**
