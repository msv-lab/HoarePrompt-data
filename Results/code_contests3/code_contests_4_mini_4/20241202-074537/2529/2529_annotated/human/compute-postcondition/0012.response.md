The code initializes an empty list called `my_list`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `e`, and `test_list`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is `m - 1`, `e` is the last float input, `test_list` contains `m` float values, and `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is `m - 1`, `e` is the last float input, `test_list` contains `m` float values, `my_list` is an empty list.**
