The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly since it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates under the constraints that `m` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and that each jump coordinate is represented as a string in the format "(a+b)/c", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details about the specific outputs or conditions under which they are returned, it is not possible to summarize the return values accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under the constraints that m is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and jump coordinates are strings formatted as "(a+b)/c", where a, b, and c are positive integers. The specific return values are not detailed in the provided information.**
