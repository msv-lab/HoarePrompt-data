The variable `test_list` is being appended with the value of `e`, which is a float input. The value of `m` and `i` do not affect this operation, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` now includes the float value `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` now includes the float value `e.**
