The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `test_list` is not defined in the initial state, but it is assumed to exist as a list to which `e` can be appended. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e**.
