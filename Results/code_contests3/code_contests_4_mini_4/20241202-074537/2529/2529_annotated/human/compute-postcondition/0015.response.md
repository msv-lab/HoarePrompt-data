According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_list`. The loop will execute for each value in `test_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first value in `test_list`, and `test_list` contains `m` float values. 

Since `i` will take on the next value in `test_list` during the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, the `test_list` must contain at least one more value beyond the current `i`. Hence, if `m` is greater than 1, there will be more values in `test_list` to iterate over.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is the second value in `test_list`, `my_list` contains the count of the first value of `test_list` in `test_list` and for the loop to execute a second time, `test_list` must contain at least 2 float values.**
