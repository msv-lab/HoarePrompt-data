According to the code, the loop will execute `m` times based on the value of `m`. Since `m` is guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most 200,000, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 during the first execution.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, the conditions are already satisfied as `m` is within the defined range, and `test_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
