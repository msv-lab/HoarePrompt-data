According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `m` is between 1 and 200,000, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
