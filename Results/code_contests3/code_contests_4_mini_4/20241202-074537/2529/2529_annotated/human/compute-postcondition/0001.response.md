`test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` remains unchanged and is still within the bounds of 1 to 200,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list.**
