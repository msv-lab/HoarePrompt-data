According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` has more elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second value in `test_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the next value in `test_list`, which means `i` will need to be the third value in the list.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `test_list`, the condition to execute another iteration is that there must be at least three elements in `test_list` (to accommodate the first, second, and third elements). 

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is the third value in `test_list`, for the loop to execute a third time `test_list` must have at least 3 elements.**
