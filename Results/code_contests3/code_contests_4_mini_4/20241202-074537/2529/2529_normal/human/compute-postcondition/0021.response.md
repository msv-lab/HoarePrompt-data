The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by its definition. It processes `m` lines of input, where `m` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Each of these lines contains a valid arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. 

After executing the function body, it evaluates each arithmetic expression and returns the results. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read and evaluate multiple arithmetic expressions, returning the calculated values for each of them based on the specified format.

Functionality: **The function processes `m` arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, and returns the evaluated results of these expressions.**
