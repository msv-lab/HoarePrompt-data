According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, it indicates that the loop will execute at least once, as `m` is at least 1. At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. The `test_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop directly, as the loop does not depend on the contents of `test_list`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
