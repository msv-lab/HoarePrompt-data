The code initializes an empty list `my_list`. The previous values of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers obtained from input; `i` is equal to `m - 1`; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers obtained from input; `i` is equal to `m - 1`; `my_list` is an empty list.**
