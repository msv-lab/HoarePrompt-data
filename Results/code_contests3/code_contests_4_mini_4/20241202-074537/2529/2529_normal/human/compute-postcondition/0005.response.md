According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be 1. Consequently, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
