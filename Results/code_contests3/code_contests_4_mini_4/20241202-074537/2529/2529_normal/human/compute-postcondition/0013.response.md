According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. For the loop to execute, `test_list` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` is initially set to `m - 1`, but this value will be overwritten by the loop. 

Since `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers and `m` is at least 1, `test_list` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Therefore, the loop will execute, and during the first iteration, `i` will take the value of the first element in `test_list`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; `i` is the first element of `test_list` during the first iteration; `my_list` is an empty list**.
