`my_list` is modified by appending the count of the value `i` (which is the third element of `test_list`) in `test_list`. The count function will return the number of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The values of `m` and `test_list` do not change, but `my_list` will now include an additional integer representing how many times `i` appears in `test_list`. 

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains at least 3 floating-point numbers; `i` is the third element of `test_list`; `my_list` now contains the count of `i` in `test_list` appended to it.**
