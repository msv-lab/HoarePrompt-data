According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
