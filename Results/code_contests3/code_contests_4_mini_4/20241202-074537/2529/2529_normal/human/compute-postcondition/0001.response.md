The code initializes an empty list called `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged with its initial value being an integer in the range from 1 to 200,000. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `m` and the new state of `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000; `test_list` is an empty list**
