The value of `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `m` can be any integer in the range of 1 to 200,000. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000**
