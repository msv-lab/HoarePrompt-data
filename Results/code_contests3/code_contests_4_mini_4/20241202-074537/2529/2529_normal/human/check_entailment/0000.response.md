The provided program is intended to count how many ships will end up at the same coordinate after the jump, based on given arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c. 

### Assessment of the Code:
1. The program reads an integer `m` representing the number of ships and then reads `m` floating-point numbers.
2. It counts the occurrences of each floating-point number in the list and outputs these counts.

### Issues with the Code:
- **Input Interpretation**: The program incorrectly treats the arithmetic expressions as floating-point numbers directly. It does not parse the expressions like "(99+98)/97" to compute their actual values. Instead, it reads them as strings and directly converts these strings to floats, which will lead to incorrect counts because the expressions themselves are not evaluated.
- **Count Logic**: The counting logic relies on the fact that the program is supposed to evaluate these expressions, but it does not do so, leading to a mismatch between the input format and the intended functionality described in the problem statement.

### Edge Cases:
- The program will fail to handle cases where the arithmetic expressions evaluate to the same value but are formatted differently. For example:
  - "(99+98)/97" evaluates to 3.0
  - "(26+4)/10" also evaluates to 3.0
  - However, if the program does not properly evaluate the expressions, it won't count these correctly.
  
### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state that the function counts occurrences based on floating-point values, but since the function does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions, it does not align with the provided problem description.

### Conclusion:
The code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions and counts the wrong values. Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
