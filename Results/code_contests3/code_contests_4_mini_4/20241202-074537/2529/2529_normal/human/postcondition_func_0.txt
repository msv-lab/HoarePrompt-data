The function accepts an integer `m` representing the number of arithmetic expressions to be processed, reads `m` floating-point numbers from input, counts the occurrences of each floating-point number in the list, and prints these counts as a space-separated string. The function does not evaluate any arithmetic expressions; instead, it simply counts and outputs the frequency of each number in the input list.
