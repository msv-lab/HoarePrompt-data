The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers that represent the coordinates of two cities. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four integer parameters representing coordinates and return the Euclidean distance between those two points.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, and returns the Euclidean distance between the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).**
