The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, representing the coordinates of two cities. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points in a 2D space. The function does not handle any potential errors related to the input values or their types, but it effectively computes the distance as long as the inputs are valid integers.
