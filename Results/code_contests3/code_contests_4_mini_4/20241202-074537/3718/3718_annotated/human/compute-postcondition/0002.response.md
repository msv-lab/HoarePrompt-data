Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which represent the coordinates of two distinct cities. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities. The function assumes the coordinates are within the specified bounds, but does not handle cases where the inputs are not distinct or invalid, as it directly computes the distance without any checks.**
