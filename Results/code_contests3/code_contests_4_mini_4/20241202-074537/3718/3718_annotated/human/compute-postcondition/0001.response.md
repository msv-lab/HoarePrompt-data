The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. These parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integer coordinates of two distinct cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 representing the coordinates of two distinct cities and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities.**
