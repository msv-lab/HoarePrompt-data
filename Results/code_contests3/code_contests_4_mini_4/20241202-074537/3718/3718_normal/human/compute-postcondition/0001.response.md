The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integer coordinates of two distinct cities and return the Euclidean distance between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities, and returns the Euclidean distance between these cities.**
