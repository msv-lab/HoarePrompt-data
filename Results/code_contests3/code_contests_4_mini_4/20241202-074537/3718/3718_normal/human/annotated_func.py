#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities, where |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 10^4; and r1 and r2 are positive integers such that 1 ≤ r1, r2 ≤ 10^4, representing the distances from each city to their respective flatland rings.
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the two distinct cities located at coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, representing the coordinates of two distinct cities. It returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities, calculated using the formula for distance in a 2D plane. There are no checks for invalid inputs or edge cases such as non-distinct cities, but the function will still compute the distance even if the cities have the same coordinates, resulting in a distance of zero.
