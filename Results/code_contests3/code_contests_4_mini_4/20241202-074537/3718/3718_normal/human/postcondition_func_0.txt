The function accepts four integer parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, representing the coordinates of two distinct cities. It returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities, calculated using the formula for distance in a 2D plane. There are no checks for invalid inputs or edge cases such as non-distinct cities, but the function will still compute the distance even if the cities have the same coordinates, resulting in a distance of zero.
