To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and see if it effectively computes the number of ways to pair men and women based on their compatibility.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of compatibility values in a 2D array `a`. 
   - The compatibility matrix is correctly constructed using the input format.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**:
   - The program initializes a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][mask]` represents the number of ways to assign the first `i` men to the set of women represented by `mask`.
   - The size of `dp` is `[n + 1][1 << n]`, which is appropriate for storing combinations of men and women.

3. **Base Case**:
   - The first row of `dp` is initialized correctly to represent one way to assign zero men (by doing nothing).

4. **Transition Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each man, and for each possible subset of women (represented by `mask`), it checks each woman to see if she is compatible with the current man (`a[i - 1][j] == 1`) and if she is included in the current subset (`mask & 1 << j`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the `dp` table by adding the number of ways to form pairs without the current woman (using `mask ^ 1 << j`).

5. **Final Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the number of ways to pair all men with the corresponding mask that includes all women (`(1 << n) - 1`).

### Edge Cases Considered

1. **Single Pair (N=1)**:
   - If the compatibility matrix is `[[0]]`, the output should be `0`, which the program correctly calculates.

2. **All Compatible (N=3 example)**:
   - For a complete compatibility matrix (all `1`s), the program should enumerate all valid pairings correctly.

3. **No Compatible Pairing**:
   - If there are no compatible pairings at all, such as the example with `N=4` where there is only one possible pairing, the program should correctly output `1`.

### Potential Issue Discovery

Upon reviewing the program, there is a potential issue in how it reads input:
- It uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. This would cause a runtime error if run in a Python 3 environment. Given the problem statement and input format, the program would not function correctly if the input is provided as expected in Python 3.

### Conclusion

The program does not handle inputs correctly in a Python 3 environment due to the use of `raw_input()`. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description requirements under this constraint.

Correctness: **False**
