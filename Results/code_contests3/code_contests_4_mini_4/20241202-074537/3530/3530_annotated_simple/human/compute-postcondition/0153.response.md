According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning that it can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at the current value for which the loop just executed. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

If the loop has executed for the value of `j`, it has reached the maximum of `n-1` in the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be equal to `n` to terminate the loop.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true; otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking it modulo `MOD`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `n`**
