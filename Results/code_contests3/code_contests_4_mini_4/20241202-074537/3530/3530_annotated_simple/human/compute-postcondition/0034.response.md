According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask`, starting from 1 and going up to `1 << n`, which is equal to `2^n`. Given that `n` is at least 1, `mask` will take on values from 1 up to `2^n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `mask` must be incremented by 1.

Since the `for` loop is structured to iterate over `mask` values starting from 1, the next value of `mask` will be 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain within the constraint, which it already does since `n` is at least 1.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the final value after processing all j from 0 to n-1, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2**
