The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on external parameters that are defined by the constraints: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and `a` is a 2D list of integers where `a[i][j]` is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility of Man i and Woman j for all 1 <= i, j <= N. 

The output of the function is not explicitly stated in the provided information. However, based on typical functionality that might involve compatibility matrices, we can infer that the function likely processes the compatibility data in some manner and returns a result based on the compatibility between men and women.

For this specific case, without the actual output information, it cannot be clearly defined what the function returns.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0 or 1) representing compatibility between men and women, and it processes this data to return a result based on compatibility.**
