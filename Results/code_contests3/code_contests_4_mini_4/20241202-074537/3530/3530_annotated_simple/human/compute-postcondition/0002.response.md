`a` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.**
