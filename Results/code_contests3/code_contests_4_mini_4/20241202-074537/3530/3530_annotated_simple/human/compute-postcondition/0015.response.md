According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. The current state indicates that the loop has executed at least once, and the variable `i` has been incremented in the last iteration. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration does not specify the current value of `i`, but since the loop has executed at least once, we can infer that `i` is now less than `2^n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `N` is such that `1 <= N <= 21`, the maximum value for `n` is 21, which leads to `2^n` being `2^21 = 2097152`. 

Thus, for the loop to continue, the following conditions must hold:

- `i` must be incremented by 1, which means if it was `i` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2^n`.

Therefore, the next state can be articulated as follows:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing `n` map objects of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is `n - 1`, `dp` is a list of lists initialized with dimensions `(n + 1)` by `(1 << n)` filled with zeroes, and `dp[0][i]` is set to 1 for each valid `i` less than `2^n`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `2^n` which is 2^n = 2^N, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**
