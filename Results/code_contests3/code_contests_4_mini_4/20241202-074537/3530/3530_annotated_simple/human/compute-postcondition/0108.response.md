The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `dp[i][mask]` unless it exceeds `MOD`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation, and its value is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation, and its value is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**.
