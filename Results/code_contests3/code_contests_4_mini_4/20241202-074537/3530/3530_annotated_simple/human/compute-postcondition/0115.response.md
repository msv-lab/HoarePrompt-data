Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 2. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` results in a non-zero value, indicating that the `j`th bit in `mask` is set.***
