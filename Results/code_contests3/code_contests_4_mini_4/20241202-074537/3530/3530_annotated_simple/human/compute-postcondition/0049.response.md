According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `mask` and `n`. The loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to \( 1 << n \) (which is \( 2^n \)). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be increased. 

Since the loop has not yet reached the upper limit, for it to execute again, `mask` should be 3. Additionally, `n` must be such that the upper limit (i.e., \( 1 << n \)) is greater than 3. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the final value after processing all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, where `i` is 1 and `mask` is 3, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1**
