In this code snippet, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1. 

First, we need to compute `mask ^ 1 << j`. The operation `1 << j` with `j` being 1 results in `2` (as `1` shifted left by 1 gives `2`). Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` becomes `3 ^ 2`, which results in `1` (since `3` in binary is `11`, and `2` is `10`, their XOR results in `01`).

Next, we need to access `dp[i - 1][1]`, which is `dp[0][1]`. Then, the value of `dp[i][mask]`, which is `dp[1][3]`, will be updated by adding the value from `dp[0][1]`.

Since we don't have specific values for `dp[0][1]` or `dp[1][3]`, we can only describe the action taken: `dp[1][3]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[0][1]` to it. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp[1][3]` is updated based on `dp[0][1]`, where `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1.**
