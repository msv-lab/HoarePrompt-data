The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` takes the value of `dp[i][mask]` and reduces it modulo `MOD`. This means that the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous values of other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Given that `dp[i][mask]` was already updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, the execution of this line will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by reducing it modulo `MOD`, `mask` is less than \(2^n\), `mask` is equal to its next value, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1.
