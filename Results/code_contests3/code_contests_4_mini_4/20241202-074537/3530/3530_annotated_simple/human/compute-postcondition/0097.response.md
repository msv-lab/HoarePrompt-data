According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, allowing `j` to take on values from 0 to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `dp[i][mask]` contains final values after processing all combinations of `mask`, but this does not affect the execution of the loop directly. The variable `mask` must also be adjusted to ensure it is less than \(2^n\) and equal to the next value (i.e., `mask` + 1). 

Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, the state must reflect that `j` starts at 0, `mask` is less than \(2^n\) and equal to its next value, and `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains final values, for the loop to execute `mask` must be less than \(2^n\), `mask` is equal to its next value (i.e., `mask` + 1), `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0**
