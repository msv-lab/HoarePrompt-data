According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `(1 << n) - 1`, which means it will execute for values of `i` from `0` up to `(1 << n) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be at its maximum value of `(1 << n) - 1`, since the loop starts with `i` equal to `0` and increments `i` with each iteration.

Since `N` is an integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, the value of `n` is implied to be the same as `N`. Therefore, `(1 << n)` evaluates to `2^n`, which is `2^N`. 

After the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. The value of `i` will then be equal to `1 << n`, which is `2^n`. However, this value exceeds the upper limit of the range defined by the loop (`(1 << n) - 1`), meaning that the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, the relevant states to note for the next iteration are that `i` will be at `2^n`, but the loop will not execute again because it exceeds the range. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing `n` map objects of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is `n - 1`, `dp` is a list of lists initialized with dimensions `(n + 1)` by `(1 << n)` filled with zeroes, `dp[0][0]` is 1, for the loop to execute a next time `i` must be less than `1 << n` which is equal to `2^n`.**
