According to the code, the loop executes for each value of `j` in the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `j` would have been incremented to the last value it can take, which is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `n` after the last iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be `n` (which is out of bounds for the current range).**
