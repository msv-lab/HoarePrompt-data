According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to the previous value of `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must now be less than `n`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `j` is now equal to the previous `j + 1`.**
