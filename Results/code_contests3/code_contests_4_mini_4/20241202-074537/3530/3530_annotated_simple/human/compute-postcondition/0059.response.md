According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`dp` is updated based on its previous value mod `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` includes `j`. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
