The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` is affected by the modulo operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`**
