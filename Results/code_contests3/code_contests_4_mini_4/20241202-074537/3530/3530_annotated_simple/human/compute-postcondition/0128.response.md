According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `mask`. The loop iterates over all possible values of `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` must be less than `2^n`. Given that `dp[i][mask]` is calculated based on the previous state, we need to adjust `mask` to the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is such that it has been processed, and for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be incremented by 1. The next value of `mask` will be `mask + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be increased, and it should be within the valid range.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, modulo `MOD`, for the loop to execute again `mask` must be incremented to the next value, which is `mask + 1`, and `mask` must be less than `2^n`.**
