According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. If `_` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, which means that for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 0. After the loop executes for the first time, `_` will be incremented by 1, so `_` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing a map object of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**.
