According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its maximum value of `n - 1`, which means for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to `n`. Therefore, `j` will be `n` at the start of the next iteration. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD` if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is true. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be equal to `n`.**
