Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask`. It is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise operations with `mask`. If `mask` is less than \(2^n\), `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates from `dp[i - 1]` for valid combinations as determined by the given conditions.**
