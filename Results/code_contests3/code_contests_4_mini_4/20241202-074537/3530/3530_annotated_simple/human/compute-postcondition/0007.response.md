According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop is set to execute `N` times, and since `_` is currently 1, it indicates that we are on the second iteration of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `_` is 1, which means we have completed one iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `_` being 2. 

Since `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and we have not reached the value of `N` yet, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing a map object of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
