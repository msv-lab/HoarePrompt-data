According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` ranges from 1 to `2^n - 1`.**
