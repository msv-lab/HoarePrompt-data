According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` was updated based on the condition involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask`. Since we're looking for the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increase `j` by 1 for the next loop execution. 

Thus, if `j` is currently at its last executed value, which is `n - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, it will be incremented to `j + 1`. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is `j + 1` and must be less than `n`**
