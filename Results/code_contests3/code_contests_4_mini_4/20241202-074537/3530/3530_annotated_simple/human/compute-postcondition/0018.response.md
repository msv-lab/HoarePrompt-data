According to the code, the loop iterates from `1` to `n`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least `1`, which is ensured by the given condition `1 <= N <= 21`. The loop variable `i` will start at `1` in the first iteration. 

Since the variables `N`, `a`, `MOD`, `_`, and `dp` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, we only need to ensure the condition on `n`. 

Thus, the relevant state for the loop to execute is that `n` must be at least `1`, and `i` will be initialized to `1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
