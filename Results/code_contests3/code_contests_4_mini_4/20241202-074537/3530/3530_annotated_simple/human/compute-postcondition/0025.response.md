According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1.

Since the loop can continue as long as `j` is less than `n`, and `n` is at least 1, `j` must now be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, the state needs to reflect that `j` is now 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
