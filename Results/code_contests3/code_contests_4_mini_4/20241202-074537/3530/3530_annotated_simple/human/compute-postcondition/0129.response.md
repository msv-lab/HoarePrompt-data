According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which determines the number of iterations in the loop. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` is a sum calculated based on previous values.

Since you mentioned that `mask` must be incremented to the next value (`mask + 1`) and that `mask` must be less than `2^n`, it is essential to ensure that the current value of `mask` meets these criteria. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `j` will start from 0. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are as follows:

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than `2^n`.**
