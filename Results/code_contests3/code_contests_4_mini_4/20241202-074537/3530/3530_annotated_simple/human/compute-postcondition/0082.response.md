According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time. Given that `mask` is currently less than \(2^n\), the next value of `mask` will be `mask + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, `j` is initialized to 0, and `mask` is valid such that it can increase in the next iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than \(2^n\)**
