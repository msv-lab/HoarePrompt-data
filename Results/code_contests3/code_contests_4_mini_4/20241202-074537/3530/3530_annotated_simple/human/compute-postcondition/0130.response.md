Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than `2^n`. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true).***
