The code snippet `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and appends the resulting map object to the list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, after this operation, `a` will contain a single element which is a map object representing the integers from the input string.

The other variables `N`, `MOD`, and `_` remain unchanged in this operation. However, the input must be provided for the `raw_input` function to execute and affect the state of `a`.

Since the input is not defined, it is assumed that the user will provide a valid input string representing integers.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing a map object of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 0**.
