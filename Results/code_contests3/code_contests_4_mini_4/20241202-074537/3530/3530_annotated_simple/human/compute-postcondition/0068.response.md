Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask`, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Additionally, `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and (1 left shifted by `j`) is non-zero.***
