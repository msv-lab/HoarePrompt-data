According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask`, and `j` is at its current value. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was at a certain value during the last iteration, it will increase to the next integer. In this case, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` contains the final values after processing all combinations of `mask`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `j` will be incremented to `j + 1`.**
