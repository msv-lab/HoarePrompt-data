The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. Since `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, `dp[0][0]` will be set to 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing `n` map objects of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is `n - 1`, `dp` is a list of lists initialized with dimensions `(n + 1)` by `(1 << n)` filled with zeroes, and `dp[0][0]` is 1.
