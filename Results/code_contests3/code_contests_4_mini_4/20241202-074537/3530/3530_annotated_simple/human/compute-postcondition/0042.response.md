The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not given explicitly, but it is modified by this operation. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, with `mask` being 2 and `i` being 1**.
