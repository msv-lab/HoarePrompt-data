The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. The previous state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. However, the specific values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `MOD` are not provided in the initial state. Thus, the output state can only describe the operation that was performed without specific numerical results.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`**
