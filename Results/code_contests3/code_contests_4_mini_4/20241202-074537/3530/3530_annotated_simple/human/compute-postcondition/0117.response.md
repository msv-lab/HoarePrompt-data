The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` was `X + dp[i - 1][0]`. Therefore, after executing this line, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated to `(X + dp[i - 1][0]) % MOD`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `(X + dp[i - 1][0]) % MOD`**
