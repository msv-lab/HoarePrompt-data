According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `mask`. The loop iterates over `mask` from `1` to `1 << n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `n`. 

Since the loop has already executed for the current value of `mask`, for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` needs to be incremented. The next value of `mask` will be `2`, as the loop will increment the value of `mask` after it completes its current iteration. 

Since the range is from `1` to `1 << n`, the loop can execute again as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`. 

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, `mask` is 2, and `j` is equal to `n`.**
