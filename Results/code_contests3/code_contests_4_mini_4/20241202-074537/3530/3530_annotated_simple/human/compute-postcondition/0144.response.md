According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. Additionally, the variable `j` will start at 0 when the loop executes its first iteration.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
