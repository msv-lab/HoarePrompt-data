Postcondition: ***`dp[i][mask]` is the final value after processing all j from 0 to n-1, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The element at `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and (1 shifted left by `j`) is non-zero.***
