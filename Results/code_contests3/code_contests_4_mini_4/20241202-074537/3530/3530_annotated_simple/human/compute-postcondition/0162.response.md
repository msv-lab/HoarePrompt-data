The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of men and women (with the constraint that \(1 \leq n \leq 21\)) and a 2D list `a` of integers where each entry indicates compatibility (0 or 1) between man \(i\) and woman \(j\). The function processes this input to calculate the number of unique perfect matchings between men and women based on their compatibility. It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to make these matchings while ensuring that each man is matched to a compatible woman. The final result is printed, which represents the total number of perfect matchings for all men with women considering the compatibility constraints.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 21) and a 2D list `a` (where a[i][j] is either 0 or 1), calculates the number of perfect matchings based on compatibility, and prints the result. **
