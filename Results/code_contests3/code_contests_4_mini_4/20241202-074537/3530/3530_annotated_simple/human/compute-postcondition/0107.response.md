The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The modulo operation previously applied ensures that the updated value remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, which is always true as long as `n` is a non-negative integer. The value of `j` is set to `n`, which influences the calculation of `mask ^ 1 << j`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`, which is now increased by the value from the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it**.
