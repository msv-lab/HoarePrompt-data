The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask by flipping the j-th bit of `mask`, which is valid since `mask` is less than \(2^n\) and `j` is 0, meaning the j-th bit can be manipulated. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a[i - 1][j]`, and the condition involving `mask`) remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it; `mask` is less than \(2^n\), `mask` is equal to its next value, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1.**
