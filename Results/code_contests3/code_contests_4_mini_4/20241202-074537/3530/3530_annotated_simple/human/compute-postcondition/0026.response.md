The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variables involved are `i`, `mask`, and `j`. The value of `mask` is currently 1, and `j` is 1. The expression `1 << j` evaluates to `2`, so `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `1 ^ 2`, which results in `3`. 

Therefore, the code modifies `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to it. The states of `N`, `n`, and the other variables remain unchanged, but the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` will now include the contribution from the previous state `dp[i - 1][3]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to it.**
