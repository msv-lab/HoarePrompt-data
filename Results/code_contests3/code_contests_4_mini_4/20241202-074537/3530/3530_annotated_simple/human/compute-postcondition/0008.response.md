The code appends a new map object of integers created from the input to the list `a`. Since `raw_input()` accepts a line of input and `map(int, ...)` converts each element of the input into an integer, the list `a` will grow by one map object that contains these integers. The other variables (`N`, `MOD`, and `_`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing a map object of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is 2, and the list `a` is appended with a new map object of integers from the input.**
