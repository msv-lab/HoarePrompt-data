According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop executes for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be one less than `n` since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 each time until it reaches `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n`, which is outside the range of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` would need to be `n`, and `n` must remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by reducing it modulo `MOD`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, and `j` is `n`.**
