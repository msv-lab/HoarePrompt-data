To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

The loop iterates over `j` in the range of `n`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that some conditions were met for `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask` to update `dp[i][mask]`, but we are not provided with specific values or conditions for `n`, `j`, or `mask` beyond what is described.

Since the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`, we know:

1. The loop has iterated at least once, meaning `j` has a current value.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
3. Thus, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

Therefore, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`If a[i - 1][j] is equal to 1 and mask AND 1 << j is true, then dp[i][mask] is updated by taking dp[i][mask] modulo MOD. At the end of the last iteration, j is such that j < n - 1, for the loop to execute one more time, j will be `j + 1` and n must be greater than `j + 1`.**
