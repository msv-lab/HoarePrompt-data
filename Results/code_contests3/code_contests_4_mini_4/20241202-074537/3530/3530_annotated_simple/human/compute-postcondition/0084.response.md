The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Since `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, the expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes the mask that excludes the bit corresponding to `j`. This means we are looking up the value from the previous state `dp[i - 1]` for this modified mask. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `mask`, and `a[i - 1][j]`) do not change in this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than \(2^n\).

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is less than \(2^n\)**.
