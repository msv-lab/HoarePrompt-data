According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is set to `N`. The loop will execute `n` times, where `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, and `mask` is equal to `2^n`, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The value of `mask` should not exceed `2^n - 1` for the loop to execute again, but this condition is not necessary for the first execution of the loop.

At the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 0. The values of `N` and `n` don't need to change since they are already within the specified bounds. 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, it is sufficient that `N` is a positive integer, and `j` should start at 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `j` is 0**
