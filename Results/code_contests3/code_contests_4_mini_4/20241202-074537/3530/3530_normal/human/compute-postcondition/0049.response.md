According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of `mask` from 1 to `2^n - 1` (where `n` is equal to `N`). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` has taken all values from 1 up to `2^n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be incremented to the next value, which is `2^n`.

Since `mask` starts at 1 and goes to `2^n - 1`, it cannot execute again after reaching `2^n - 1`. Therefore, it will not execute a subsequent time for any `N` in the range provided.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `mask` is equal to `2^n`, but for the loop to execute again, `mask` should not exceed `2^n - 1`**
