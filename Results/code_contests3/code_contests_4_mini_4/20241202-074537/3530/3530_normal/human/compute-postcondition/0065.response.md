According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs for `i` starting from 1 up to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the last executed value of `i` was `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is equal to `N`, `i` will be `k + 1`, and it must be less than or equal to `N`. 

If `i` is currently `k`, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be `k + 1`, and we need to ensure that `n` (which is `N`) is greater than or equal to `k + 1`.

Thus, if `i` is currently at its maximum value of `n`, the loop will not execute again. However, if `i` is less than `n`, it will be incremented.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `k`.**
