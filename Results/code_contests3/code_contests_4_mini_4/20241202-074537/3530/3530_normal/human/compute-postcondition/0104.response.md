The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but it will be modified by the modulo operation, which ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds of `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged, and since `dp[i][mask]` is being updated, we reflect that in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 1`; `mask` is 3; `j` must be equal to `n`, which is `N`; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.**
