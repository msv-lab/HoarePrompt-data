Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true for any `j` from 0 to `n-1`, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the values in `dp[i - 1]`. The final state of `dp[i][mask]` will reflect all valid updates performed during the iterations of the loop.**
