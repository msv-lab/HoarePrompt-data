The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `N`, `n`, or `j`, nor does it affect the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 0; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by modulo `MOD`.**
