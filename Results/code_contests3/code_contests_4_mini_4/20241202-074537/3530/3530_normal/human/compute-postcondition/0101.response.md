Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD` applied. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
