Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` and a 2D list `a` of size `N x N`, where each element indicates compatibility (0 or 1) between `N` men and `N` women. It computes the number of valid ways to pair all men with women such that each man is paired with a compatible woman, using dynamic programming and returns this count modulo `1000000007`. The function does not handle any input errors or constraints explicitly beyond the initial assumption that `N` is between 1 and 21. **
