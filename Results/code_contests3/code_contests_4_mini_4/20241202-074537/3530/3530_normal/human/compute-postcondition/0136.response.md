The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with `MOD`.**
