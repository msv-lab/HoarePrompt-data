The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

- The variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` are involved in this operation. 
- The specific values of `i` and `mask` are derived from the initial state, where `i` is equal to `k + 1`, and `mask` is 3.
- The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask, where `1 << j` shifts the number 1 to the left by `j` bits, and then it is XORed with `mask`.

Since the initial state provides that `dp[i][mask]` is being updated based on a prior state `dp[i - 1][...]`, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i][mask]` has changed. However, without the specific values of `dp` or any other context, we can only describe the general impact:

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it.**
