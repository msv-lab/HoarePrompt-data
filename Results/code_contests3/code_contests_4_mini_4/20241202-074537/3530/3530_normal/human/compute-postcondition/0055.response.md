According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain at least 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
