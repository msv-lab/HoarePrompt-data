The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `N`, `n`, or `j`, but it modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` based on its previous state and the constant `MOD`. The exact values depend on the current state of `dp[i][mask]` before the operation, which is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD.**
