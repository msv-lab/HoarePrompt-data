According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`, which is equal to `N`. The loop will iterate over the range of `n`, meaning it will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` will also be at least 1. 

The variable `j` will start at 0 at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should be initialized to 0, and `n` must be equal to or greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
