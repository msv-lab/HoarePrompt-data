The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i`, `mask`, and `j`. 

- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `mask` starts at 1.
- `j` is 2.

The operation performed is a bitwise XOR on `mask` with `1 << j`, which shifts 1 to the left by `j` (which is 2), resulting in `1 << 2` equal to 4. Therefore, `mask ^ (1 << j)` equals `1 ^ 4`, which is 5.

The value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][5]` to it. 

The output state reflects the changes made to `dp[i][mask]` based on the current values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][5]` to `dp[i][mask]`, `j` is 2**.
