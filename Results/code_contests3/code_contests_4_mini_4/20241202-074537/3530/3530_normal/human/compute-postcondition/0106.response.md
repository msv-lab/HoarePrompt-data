According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n + 1`, which is outside the valid range for the loop since `j` must be less than `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be adjusted to `n`, and the loop cannot execute again as `j` cannot be less than `n` anymore.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 1`; `mask` is 3; and `j` is equal to `n`, so the loop cannot execute again.**
