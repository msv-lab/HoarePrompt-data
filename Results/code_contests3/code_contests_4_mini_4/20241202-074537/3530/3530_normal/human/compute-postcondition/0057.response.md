The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value at `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The variable `dp[i][mask]` is affected, while other variables remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i][mask]` was previously updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but the exact value is not known. The state of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `j`) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.**
