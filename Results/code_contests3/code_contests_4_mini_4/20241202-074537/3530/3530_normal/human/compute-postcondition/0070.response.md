The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking it modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not impacted directly by the code snippet itself; however, the code ensures that the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been adjusted accordingly.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the bounds of `MOD`**
