According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to `2`. Since `n` is equal to `N`, where `N` is between 1 and 21, `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, to execute the loop a second time, `j` should be `2`, and we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `2`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
