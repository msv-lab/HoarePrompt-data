The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but this operation ensures that the value is constrained within the range defined by `MOD`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, as this operation only affects `dp[i][mask]`. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`.**
