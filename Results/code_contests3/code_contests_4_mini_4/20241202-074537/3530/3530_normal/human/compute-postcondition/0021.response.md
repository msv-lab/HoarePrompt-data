Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to \(2^N - 1\), for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0, `mask` is 1, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 while `mask` has the j-th bit set (mask & 1 << j is true).***
