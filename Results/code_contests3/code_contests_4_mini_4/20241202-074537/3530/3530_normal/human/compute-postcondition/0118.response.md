Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` starts at 1, `j` is 1, and if the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & 1 << j is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated as `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
