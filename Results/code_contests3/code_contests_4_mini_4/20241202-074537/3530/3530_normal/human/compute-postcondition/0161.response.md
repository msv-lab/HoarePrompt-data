The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it implicitly relies on two constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), and `a`, which is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but it operates on a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0 or 1) representing compatibility between N men and N women. The output details are not specified.**
