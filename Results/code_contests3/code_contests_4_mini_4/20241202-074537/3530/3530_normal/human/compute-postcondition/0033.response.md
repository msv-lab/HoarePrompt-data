Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to \(2^N - 1\); `j` has taken all values from 0 to `n-1`; `mask` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and the bitwise operations with `mask`, resulting in the final value of `dp[i][mask]` being the sum of contributions from all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` entries modulo `MOD`.**
