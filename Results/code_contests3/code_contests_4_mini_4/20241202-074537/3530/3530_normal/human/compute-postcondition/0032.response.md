Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to \(2^N - 1\), and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
