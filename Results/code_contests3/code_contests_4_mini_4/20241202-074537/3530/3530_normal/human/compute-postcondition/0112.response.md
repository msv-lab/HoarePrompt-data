According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `n` is equal to `N`, a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), and since `i` is currently `k + 1`, to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

Thus, if `i` is `k + 1` and `i` must become `k + 2` for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `k + 2` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

1. `i` will be `k + 2`.
2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k + 2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 2`; `mask` is in the range from 1 to `2^n - 1`; `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`; and for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than or equal to `k + 2`.**
