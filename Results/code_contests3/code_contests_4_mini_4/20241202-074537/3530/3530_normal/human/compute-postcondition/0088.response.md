The code snippet updates a dynamic programming table `dp` at the index `[i][mask]` by adding the value from the previous index `[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The operation involves bitwise manipulation where `1 << j` represents a left shift of 1 by `j` bits, and `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask by toggling the `j`-th bit of `mask`.

Given that `n` is equal to `N` and `j` is 1, this operation will alter the state of `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `mask`, and the previous state in the `dp` table. 

Without knowing the specific values of `i`, `mask`, or the content of the `dp` array, we can conclude that the value at `dp[i][mask]` will change based on the previous value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. However, the other variables and the exact new value can't be determined from the provided information.

Therefore, the output state is: the current state of `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**.
