Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
