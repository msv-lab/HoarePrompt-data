The code modifies the value at `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables affected are `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j`. The specific values of `N`, `n`, and `j` are known. 

Since `j` is 2, the operation involves a bitwise XOR with `1 << j`, which is `1 << 2` or `4`. The value of `mask` is also not specified, so it retains its previous state. The output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`.**
