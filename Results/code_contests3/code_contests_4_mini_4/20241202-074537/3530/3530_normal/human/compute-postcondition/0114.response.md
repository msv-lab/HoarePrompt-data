According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is equal to `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` will also be in the same range. The loop executes `n` times, and since `i` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is `k + 2` and for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than or equal to `k + 2`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `j` starts at 1 for the second execution.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` starts at 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than or equal to `k + 2, j is 1**
