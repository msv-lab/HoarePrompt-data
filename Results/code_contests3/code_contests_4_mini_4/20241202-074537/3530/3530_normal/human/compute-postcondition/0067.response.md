According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is equal to `N`, and given that `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. 

The variable `i` is set to `k + 1`, where `k` is less than `N`. This means that `i` will be at least 1, assuming `k` is at least 0, which is within the specified range. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` will start at 0 when the loop begins (the first iteration of `range(n)`).

The statement also specifies that for the loop to execute the first time, `mask` must be equal to 1. Thus, we need to ensure that `mask` is set to 1.

Putting it all together, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` < `N`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
