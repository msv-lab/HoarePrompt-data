According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit determined by `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `0` to `1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`), meaning it can execute as long as `i` is less than `2^n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is equal to `N`, where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21. Thus, `2^n` (or `2^N`) must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. 

After the current iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 1, and we need to ensure that `n` is still equal to `N` and that `2^N` is greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `2^N` is greater than 1**
