Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to \(2^N - 1\); for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0; `mask` is 1; `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 while `mask` has the j-th bit set; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
