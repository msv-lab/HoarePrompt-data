According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, giving `j` a value of 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
