The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` performs a modulo operation on `dp[i][mask]`. This means the value of `dp[i][mask]` is reduced to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. The variables `N`, `n`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `N`, `n`, and `j`, along with the modification to `dp[i][mask]`:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**.
