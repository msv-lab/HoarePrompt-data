The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but the modulo operation will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated while the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD` applied**
