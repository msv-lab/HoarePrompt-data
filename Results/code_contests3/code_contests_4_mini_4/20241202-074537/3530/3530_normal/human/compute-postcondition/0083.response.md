Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` < `N`, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0 for the first execution of the loop, the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is not equal to 0.***
