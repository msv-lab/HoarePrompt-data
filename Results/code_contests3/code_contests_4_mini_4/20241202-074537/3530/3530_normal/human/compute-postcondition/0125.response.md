The expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not specified, but the current value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the range of `0` to `MOD - 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `j` is equal to `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
