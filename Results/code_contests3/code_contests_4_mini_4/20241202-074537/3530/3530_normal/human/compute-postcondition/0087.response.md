According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is equal to `N`, where `1 <= N <= 21`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

So, `j` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be equal to `N` (which remains in the range of 1 to 21).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be equal to `N`**
