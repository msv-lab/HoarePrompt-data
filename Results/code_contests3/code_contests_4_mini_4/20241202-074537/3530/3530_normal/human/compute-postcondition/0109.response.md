Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 1`; `mask` is 3; `j` is equal to `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` & 1 << `j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo operation with `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `dp[i][mask]`.***
