According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will iterate for values of `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is equal to `N`, where `1 <= N <= 21`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

Since `n` is equal to `N`, and `N` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2 (i.e., `N` must be at least 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 2.**
