Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
