The code modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given the initial state, `mask` is 1, and the operation performed involves a bitwise XOR with `1 << j`, where `j` is 1. Therefore, we compute `mask ^ 1 << j`, which is `1 ^ 2`, resulting in `3`. The value of `dp[i - 1][3]` will be added to `dp[i][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to \(2^N - 1\); `j` is 1; `mask` is 1; and `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i][1] + dp[i - 1][3]`.**
