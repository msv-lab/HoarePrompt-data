The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Given that:
- `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 21 \)
- `n` is equal to `N`
- `i` is `k + 1`, where \( k < N \)
- `mask` is 1
- `j` is 0
- The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1
- The value of `mask AND (bitwise) shifted left by j` is not 0

The code indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is being updated based on a previous state from `dp[i - 1][...]`. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask by flipping the j-th bit of `mask`. Since `mask` is 1 and `j` is 0, the expression evaluates to `mask ^ 1`, which results in 0.

Now, we need to consider what happens to `dp[i][mask]`:
- The value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][0]` to it.

The output state will reflect that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated, although we do not have specific values for `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it**.
