According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 2. Additionally, since `n` is equal to `N` and `N` can be at most 21, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**.
