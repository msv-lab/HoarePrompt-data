Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 1`; `mask` is 2; `j` is 0; if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no updates are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
