According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 2`, and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 21. Since `j` is currently at its maximum value of `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, since `j` would have reached `n-1`, to execute the loop again, `j` must become equal to `n`, which is outside the current range. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible.

Therefore, the state can be summarized as:
State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be equal to `n` but since `j` cannot be less than `n`, the loop cannot execute again.**
