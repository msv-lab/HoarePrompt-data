Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` < `N`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the bounds of `MOD`. If the condition is not met, there is no update to `dp[i][mask]`.***
