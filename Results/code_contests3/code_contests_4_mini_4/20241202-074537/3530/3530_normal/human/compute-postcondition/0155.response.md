The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not specified, but the operation ensures that the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will be within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, and no new variables are introduced.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21; `n` must be greater than `j`; `j` is now `j + 1`; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.**
