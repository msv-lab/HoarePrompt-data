According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `mask`, which ranges from 1 to `1 << n` (which is 2 raised to the power of `n`). The variable `mask` is currently 2 at the end of the last iteration, and for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be incremented.

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2, and it will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`, which is 2 raised to the power of `n` (or 2^N).

Since `n` is equal to `N` and `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `1 << n` will be at least 4 when `N` is 2 or higher. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be less than `1 << n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1`, `mask` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `mask` must be less than 2 raised to the power of `n` (which is 2^N)**
