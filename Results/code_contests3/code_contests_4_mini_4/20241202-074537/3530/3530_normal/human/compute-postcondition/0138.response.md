According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `n` is equal to `N`, and `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 3**
