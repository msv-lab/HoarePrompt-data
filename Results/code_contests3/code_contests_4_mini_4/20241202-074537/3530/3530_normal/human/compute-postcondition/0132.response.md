The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is modified by the operation. The states of other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the modification of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
