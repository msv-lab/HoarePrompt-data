The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not provided, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` is being modified to ensure it does not exceed `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`, while `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` is unaffected in this step.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`**
