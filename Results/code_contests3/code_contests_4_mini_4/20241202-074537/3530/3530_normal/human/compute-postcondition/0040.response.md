According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, which means after the increment, `j` must be less than `N`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
