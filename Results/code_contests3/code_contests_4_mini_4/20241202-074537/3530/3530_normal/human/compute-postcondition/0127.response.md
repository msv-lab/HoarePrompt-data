Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` has been potentially updated based on the conditions evaluated for each `j`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative results based on the evaluations of `a[i - 1][j]` and the mask operations throughout all iterations of the loop.**
