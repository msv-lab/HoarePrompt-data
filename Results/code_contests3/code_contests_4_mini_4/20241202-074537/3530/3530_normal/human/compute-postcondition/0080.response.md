Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` < `N`, `mask` is 1, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n-1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions of `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask`, resulting in `dp[i][mask]` being a value that is the sum of relevant previous values in the `dp` array, all taken modulo `MOD`.**
