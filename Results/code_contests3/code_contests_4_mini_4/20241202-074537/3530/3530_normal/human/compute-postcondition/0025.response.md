According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which is equal to `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1.

Therefore, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`, which is equal to `N`. Since `j` is now 1, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` from 0 to \(2^N - 1\); for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1; `mask` is 1; for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1**
