According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit of the range, which is `n`. Since `j` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we do not have the exact value of `j` provided, but we know that it must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Given that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` must also fall within this range.

The loop will execute one more time, so `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was the last value before exiting the loop, it would now be increased to `j + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `j`, and `j` is now `j + 1`.**
