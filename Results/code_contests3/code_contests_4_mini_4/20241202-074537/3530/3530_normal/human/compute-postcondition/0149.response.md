According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 21. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is `m + 1`, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2.**
