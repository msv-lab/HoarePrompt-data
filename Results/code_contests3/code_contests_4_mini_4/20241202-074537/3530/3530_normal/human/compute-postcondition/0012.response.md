The variable `dp` is a 2D array (or list) where the first index is `0` and the second index is `i`. The previous value of `i` is `0`. Therefore, `dp[0][0]` is assigned the value `1`. The state of other variables (`N`, `n`) is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, and `dp[0][0]` is assigned the value 1.**
