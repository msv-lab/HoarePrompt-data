The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value at `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21
- `n` is equal to `N`
- `i` is `k + 2` (where `k` is unknown)
- `mask` is less than `1 << n`
- `j` is 3

Since the values of `k`, `dp`, and the specific values for `mask` and `j` are not specified, we can only describe the change in terms of the relationship between the indices of the `dp` array.

The variable `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `mask ^ 1 << j` represents a bitwise XOR operation that alters `mask` based on the value of `j`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is `k + 2`; `mask` is less than `1 << n`; `j` is 3; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
