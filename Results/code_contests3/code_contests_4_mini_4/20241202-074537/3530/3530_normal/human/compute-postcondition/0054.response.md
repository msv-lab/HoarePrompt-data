Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, and `j` is 0. If the value at the position `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
