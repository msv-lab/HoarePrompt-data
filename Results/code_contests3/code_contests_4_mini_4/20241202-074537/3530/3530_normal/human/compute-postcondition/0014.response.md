`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. The variable `i` is `1`, so the specific assignment is `dp[0][1] = 1`. The values of `N`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, and `dp[0][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, and `dp[0][1]` is set to 1.**
