According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. The expression `1 << n` means `2^n`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2^N`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 2. Additionally, the condition for the loop to execute again must be that `i` (which is now 2) is still less than `2^N`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `2^N`**
