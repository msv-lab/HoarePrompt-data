Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 2`, `mask` is `m + 1` (where `m + 1` is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND operation results in a non-zero value when `mask` is ANDed with `1 << j`***
