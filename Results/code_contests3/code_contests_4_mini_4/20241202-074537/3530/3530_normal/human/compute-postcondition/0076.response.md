According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\). 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `k + 1`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
