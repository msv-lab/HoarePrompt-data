You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and a is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility of N men and N women.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing all integers from the input collected during the iterations; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string representing a positive integer >= the total number of inputs collected.
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is a string representing a positive integer that can be converted correctly to an integer; `i` is `(1 << n) - 1`; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `(1 << n) - 1`.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the final accumulated values calculated by the nested loops based on the conditions checked for all combinations of `mask` and `j`, reflecting all updates made during the iterations, reduced modulo `MOD`.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0s and 1s) that represent compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. It processes these inputs using dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to perfectly match `N` men with `N` women based on their compatibility. The result is printed as the number of perfect matchings modulo 1000000007. If the input is invalid or does not conform to the expected format, the function may not handle these cases, leading to potential errors.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
