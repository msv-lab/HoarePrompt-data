Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to the program state.***
