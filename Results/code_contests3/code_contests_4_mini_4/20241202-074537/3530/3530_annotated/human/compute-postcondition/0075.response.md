Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, and `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the result of the modulo operation. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
