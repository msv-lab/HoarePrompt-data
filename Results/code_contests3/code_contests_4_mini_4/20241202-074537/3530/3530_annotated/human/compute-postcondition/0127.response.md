Initial State: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1 and for it to execute a second time `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Code of the loop:
```
for j in range(n):
    if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
        dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
        dp[i][mask] %= MOD
```

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `j` will be equal to `n` (as the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 1`). The final state of the loop depends on the conditions within the loop. If any `a[i - 1][j]` was equal to 1 and the condition `mask & 1 << j` was true for any `j` in the range, then the `dp[i][mask]` would have been updated based on the values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` will reflect any such updates made during the iterations.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is equal to `n`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated according to the conditions met during the iterations.**
