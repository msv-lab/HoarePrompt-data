Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21; `j` is 1; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it, and afterwards `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
