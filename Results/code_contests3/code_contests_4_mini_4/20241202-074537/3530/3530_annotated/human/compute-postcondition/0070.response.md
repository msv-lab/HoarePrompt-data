Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is now 0, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n`, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
