According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `n` is between 1 and 21, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 2, and `mask` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.**
