The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but we do not have specific values for these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed without knowing the specific values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
