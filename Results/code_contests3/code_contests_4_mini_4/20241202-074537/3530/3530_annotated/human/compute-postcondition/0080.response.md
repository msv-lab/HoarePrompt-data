Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is `n - 1`, and `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` will contain the cumulative result based on the conditions applied for each value of `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, depending on the values in `a[i - 1]` and the bits set in `mask`.**
