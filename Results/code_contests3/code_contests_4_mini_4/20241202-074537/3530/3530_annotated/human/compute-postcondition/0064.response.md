Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions checked for all combinations of `mask` and `j` in the nested loops, reflecting the updates made during the iterations.**
