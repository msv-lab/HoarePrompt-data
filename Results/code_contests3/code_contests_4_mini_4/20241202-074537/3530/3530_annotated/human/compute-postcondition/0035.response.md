According to the code, the loop will execute a number of times equal to the integer value of `n`, which is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21. The variable `j` is initialized to `n - 1`, meaning it starts from one less than the value of `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, the condition to execute one more time requires that `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and it will be `mask + 1` for the next iteration.

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, we need to confirm that `n` is a valid positive integer (between 1 and 21), `j` is set correctly to `0` (which is `n - 1` when `n` is 1), and `mask` is less than `1 << n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states should confirm that `n` is at least 1, and `mask` must be less than `1 << n`, with `j` starting at `0`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time), `mask` must be less than `1 << n**
