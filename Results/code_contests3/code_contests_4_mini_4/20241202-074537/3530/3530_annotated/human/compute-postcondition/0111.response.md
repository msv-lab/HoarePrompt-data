Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative results for all values of `mask` based on the conditions applied to each value of `j`, utilizing the values in `a[i - 1]` and the bits set in `mask`, reduced modulo `MOD`.**
