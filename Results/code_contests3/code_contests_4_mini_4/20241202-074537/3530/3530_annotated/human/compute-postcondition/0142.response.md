Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on the conditions evaluated during the loop iterations. If none of the conditions were met during any iteration, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
