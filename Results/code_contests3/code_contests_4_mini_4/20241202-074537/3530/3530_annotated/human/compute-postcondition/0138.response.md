According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. 

Additionally, since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. The variable `mask` remains unchanged and is still the next integer that is currently less than \(2^n\).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21 greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)).**
