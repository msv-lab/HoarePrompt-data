According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 after this iteration. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21.

The updated state needs to reflect the new value of `j` and indicate that the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, and `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n` for the loop to execute a second time (`j` must be less than `n`).**
