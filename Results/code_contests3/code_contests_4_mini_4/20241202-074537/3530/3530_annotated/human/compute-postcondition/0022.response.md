The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Let's break it down:
- `mask` has the j-th bit set, meaning `mask & 1 << j` is true.
- The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` flips the j-th bit of `mask`. 
- Therefore, `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` retrieves a value from the previous state of `dp` using the modified `mask`.
- The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by this retrieved value.

Since the specific values of `dp`, `i`, and `mask` are not provided, we cannot determine exact numeric outcomes, but we know that the value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it**
