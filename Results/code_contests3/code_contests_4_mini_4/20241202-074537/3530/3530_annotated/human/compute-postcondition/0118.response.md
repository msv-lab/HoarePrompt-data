Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 0, and `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
