Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 0, and `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)). If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with its value modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
