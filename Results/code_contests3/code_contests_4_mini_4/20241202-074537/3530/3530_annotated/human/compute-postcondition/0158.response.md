Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is equal to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the cumulative conditions evaluated for all valid `j` in the range of `n`. If no conditions were met during any iteration, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
