Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is converted to an integer, `j` is 0, `mask` is 2, and `mask` is less than `1 << n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
