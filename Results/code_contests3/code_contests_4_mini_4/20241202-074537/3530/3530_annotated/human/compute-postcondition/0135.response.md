The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. The variable `mask` is manipulated using a bitwise XOR operation with `1 << j`, which represents a bitwise shift of 1 to the left by `j` positions, effectively flipping the bit at position `j` in `mask`. 

Since `N`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` are defined in the initial state but their specific values are not provided, we cannot derive exact values for the affected variables. However, we note that no other variables are affected by this operation besides `dp`.

Thus, the output state reflects the operation and the context of the variables without specifying exact values. The final output state summarizes the operation's effect on `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it.**
