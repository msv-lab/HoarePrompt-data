According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is converted to an integer, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.**
