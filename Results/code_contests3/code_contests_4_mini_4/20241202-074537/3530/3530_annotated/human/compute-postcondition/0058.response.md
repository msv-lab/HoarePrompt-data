Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is converted to an integer, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise ANDed with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no updates are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
