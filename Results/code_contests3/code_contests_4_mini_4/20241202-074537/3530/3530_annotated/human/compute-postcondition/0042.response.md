The operation modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not explicitly given, but it is being updated based on the condition `dp[i][mask] = dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `j`, `mask`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21; `j` is 1; `mask` is less than `1 << n`; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
