The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not provided, but this operation will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. Other variables and states are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, `mask` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.**
