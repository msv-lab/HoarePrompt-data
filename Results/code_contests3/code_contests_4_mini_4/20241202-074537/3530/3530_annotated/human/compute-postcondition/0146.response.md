Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and `mask` has the j-th bit set; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
