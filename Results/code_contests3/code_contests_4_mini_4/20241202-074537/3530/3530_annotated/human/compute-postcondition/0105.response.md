Postcondition: ***`N` and `n` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 21, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no change occurs in `dp[i][mask]`.***
