The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 21. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `a`, which is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1. This 2D list represents the compatibility of N men and N women. The function processes this input to determine the matching compatibility between the men and women based on the provided 2D list. 

The exact output of the function is not detailed in the provided information; however, it can be inferred that the function likely returns a result that reflects the matching compatibility based on the inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0s and 1s) representing compatibility between N men and N women. It processes these inputs to determine matching compatibility.**
