The code appends the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the list `a`. The `raw_input()` function takes input from the user, which is then split into individual string elements, converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`, and finally appended to the list `a`. The values of `N`, `MOD`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of new integers to the list `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing the previous integers plus new integers from input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string representing a positive integer >= k + 1**.
