According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, after the current iteration, `j` will be 2. The loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2**
