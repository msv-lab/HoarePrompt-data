Postcondition: ***`N` and `n` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 21, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation and retains its previous value, ensuring it remains within `MOD`. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
