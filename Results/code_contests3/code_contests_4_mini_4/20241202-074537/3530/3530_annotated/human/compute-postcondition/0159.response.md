Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the final accumulated values calculated by the nested loops based on the conditions checked for all combinations of `mask` and `j`, reflecting all updates made during the iterations, reduced modulo `MOD`.**
