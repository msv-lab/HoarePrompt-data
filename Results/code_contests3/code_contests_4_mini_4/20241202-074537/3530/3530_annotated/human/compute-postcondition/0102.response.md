According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since `N` and `n` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 21, we know that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to have executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 for the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than `n`, which means that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` and `n` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 21, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
