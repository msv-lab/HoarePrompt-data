The code snippet impacts the `dp` array, specifically the element at the index `[i][mask]`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given that `j` is initialized to 1, the expression `1 << j` results in `2` (since `1 << 1` is equivalent to `2`). The mask is XOR'd with `2`, which means that the second least significant bit in the binary representation of `mask` is toggled.

As for the previous values, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`. The specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `dp` are not provided, but the code is manipulating these indices based on the current state of `dp`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the change in `dp[i][mask]` but does not specify exact values due to the lack of information on the previous state of `dp`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`**
