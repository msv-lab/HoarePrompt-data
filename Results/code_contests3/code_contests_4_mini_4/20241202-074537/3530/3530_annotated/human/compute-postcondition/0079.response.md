Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
