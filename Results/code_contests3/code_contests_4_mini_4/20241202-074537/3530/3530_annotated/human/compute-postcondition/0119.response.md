According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `n-1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented to 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, and `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
