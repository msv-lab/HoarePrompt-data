The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the previous values of `dp[i][mask]`, but it ensures that the new value remains within the bounds set by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation and retains its previous value while ensuring it is within `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation and retains its previous value while ensuring it is within `MOD`.**
