According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1, and the loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, and `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
