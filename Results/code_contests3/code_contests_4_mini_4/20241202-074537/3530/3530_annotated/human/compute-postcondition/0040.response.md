According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and `j` will be increased to 1, the loop can execute a second time as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, and `mask` is less than `1 << n` for the loop to execute a second time.**
