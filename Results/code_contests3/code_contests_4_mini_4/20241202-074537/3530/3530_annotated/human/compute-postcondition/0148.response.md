Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
