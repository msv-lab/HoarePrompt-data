Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 2, and `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `dp[i][mask]`.***
