According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its previous value, and the range of `i` is from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21.

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n`, if the loop has executed at least once, `i` would be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be equal to the next integer value after the last executed value of `i`.

Thus, if `i` was equal to `k` during the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `k + 1`, and it must still be within the bounds of `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration and must be less than or equal to `n`.**
