The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value, then applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not affected by the modulo operation, but it ensures that the value remains within the limits defined by `MOD`. Other variables are not directly impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated and reduced modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated and reduced modulo `MOD`**
