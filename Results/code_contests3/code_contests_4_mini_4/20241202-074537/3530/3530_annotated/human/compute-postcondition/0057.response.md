The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` but ensures that it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus `MOD`**
