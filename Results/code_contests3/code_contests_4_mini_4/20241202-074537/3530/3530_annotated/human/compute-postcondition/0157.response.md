Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), `j` is equal to `n - 1`. If any `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j` in the range of `n`, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated according to the conditions in the loop for each valid `j`. If no conditions were met during the loop execution, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
