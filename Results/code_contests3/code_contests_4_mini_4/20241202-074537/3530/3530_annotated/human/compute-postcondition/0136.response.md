The operation modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, but since it's being updated with the modulo operation, it will now hold a value that is the remainder of its previous value divided by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State reflects this change.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
