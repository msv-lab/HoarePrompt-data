The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of the current value of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. Other variables are not affected by this operation; however, the specific previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated, but the exact previous value remains unspecified.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with its value modulo `MOD`**
