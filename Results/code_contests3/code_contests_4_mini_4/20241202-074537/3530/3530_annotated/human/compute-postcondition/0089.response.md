The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` takes the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and calculates its remainder when divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `N`, `n`, or `j`, and does not affect the specific previous values of `dp[i][mask]`. However, it updates `dp[i][mask]` to ensure it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated to its modulo with `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
