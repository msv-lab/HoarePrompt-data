Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n - 1`, and `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed, reflecting the final accumulated values calculated by the nested loops reduced modulo `MOD`.**
