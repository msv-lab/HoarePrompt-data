According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `j = 0` up to `j = n - 1`. The variable `j` is already set to `n - 1`, but since the loop initializes `j` for each iteration to start from 0, we must ensure that `n` is within the specified bounds for the loop to execute correctly. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `n` must also represent a valid positive integer that matches this condition. 

For the loop to execute the first time:
- The variable `j` will start at 0 (not `n - 1` as it is currently set).
- `n` should hold a value that is a positive integer between 1 and 21.

Thus, the state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is now 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n`**
