The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits the input string into components, converts each component to an integer, and then appends the resulting iterable of integers to the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list that can hold previous integers plus new integers from the input, and `MOD` is set to 1000000007. The variable `n` is not directly affected by the code.

Since the exact content of the input is unknown, we can't determine the specific new integers being added to the list `a`. However, we know that `a` will now include the new integers parsed from the input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing previous integers plus new integers from input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a string representing a positive integer >= k + 2.**
