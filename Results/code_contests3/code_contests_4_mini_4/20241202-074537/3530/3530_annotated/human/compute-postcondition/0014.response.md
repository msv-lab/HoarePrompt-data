The statement `dp[0][i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element at index `[0][i]` of the `dp` array. The variables `N`, `n`, and `i` do not change as a result of this operation. The previous value of `i` is 1, thereby referencing `dp[0][1]`. Therefore, after execution, `dp[0][1]` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer that can be converted correctly to an integer, `i` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1**
