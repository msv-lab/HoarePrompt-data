Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and `n` is converted to an integer. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
