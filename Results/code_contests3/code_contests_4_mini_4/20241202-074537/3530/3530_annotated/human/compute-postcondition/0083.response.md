Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is now 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the variable `mask` has the j-th bit set, indicated by `mask & 1 << j` being true.***
