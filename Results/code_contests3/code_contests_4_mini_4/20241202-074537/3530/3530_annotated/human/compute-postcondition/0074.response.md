The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD` after the addition from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation applied, while the previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation applied.**
