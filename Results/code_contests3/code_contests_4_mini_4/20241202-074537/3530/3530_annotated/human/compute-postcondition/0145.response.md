Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true).***
