The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but we know it is being modified. The value of `mask` is 1, and it does not affect the operation of the modulo directly. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`**
