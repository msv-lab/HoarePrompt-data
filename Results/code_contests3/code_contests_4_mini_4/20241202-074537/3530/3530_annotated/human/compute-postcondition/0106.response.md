According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

State: **`N` and `n` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 21, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
