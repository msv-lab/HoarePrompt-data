According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 in the next iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the value of `n` must be at least 3, as `j` will be checking against this value in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
