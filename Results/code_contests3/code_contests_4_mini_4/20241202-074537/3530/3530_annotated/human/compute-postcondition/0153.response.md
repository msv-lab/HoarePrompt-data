According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Assuming the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is `j` and it is less than `n`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be `j + 1`. Hence, it must be ensured that `j + 1` is still less than `n`.

State: **If `j` is less than `n - 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be incremented to `j + 1`, with `n` remaining unchanged.**
