According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the expression `1 << n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a string representing a positive integer that can be converted to an integer, we need to evaluate `1 << n` in terms of its integer value.

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` can take values from 1 to 21. Therefore, `1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`) will vary accordingly, and it must be calculated for the next iteration. If `n` were, for example, 3, then `1 << n` would be 8, meaning `i` can go from 1 up to 7.

To allow for one more iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 2. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`, which effectively means `n` must be such that the value of `1 << n` remains greater than 2. 

Thus, the conditions at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `N` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21.
- `n` must be a string representing a positive integer that can be converted correctly to an integer such that `1 << n` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer that can be converted correctly to an integer, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `1 << n` must be greater than 2.**
