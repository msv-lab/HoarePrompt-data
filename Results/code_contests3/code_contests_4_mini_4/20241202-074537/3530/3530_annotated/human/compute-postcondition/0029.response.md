According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes with `j` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `n` represents a positive integer between 1 and 21, and `j` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
