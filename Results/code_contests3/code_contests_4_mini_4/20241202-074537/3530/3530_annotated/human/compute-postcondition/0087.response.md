According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates through `j` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently 0, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be 1. The value of `n` must still be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
