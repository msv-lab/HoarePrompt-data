According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, stopping when it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`. 

Since `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, we can assert that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is still representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n - 1`.

To summarize:
- The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration would be `n + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to execute once more would be that `n` must still be within the range of 1 to 21 (which it is).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n - 1`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be equal to `n + 1`.**
