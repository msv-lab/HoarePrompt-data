Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21 greater than 2, `j` is 2, and `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)). If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with \(1 << j\) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
