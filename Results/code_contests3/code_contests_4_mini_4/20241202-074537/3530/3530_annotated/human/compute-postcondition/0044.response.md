According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21. 

To execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute again, the value of `n` must still be greater than 2, which means it must represent a positive integer greater than 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is a string representing a positive integer greater than 2; `j` is 2; `mask` is less than `1 << n.**
