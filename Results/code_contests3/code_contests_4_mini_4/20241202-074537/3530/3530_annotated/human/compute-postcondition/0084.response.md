The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i][mask]` (which is updated) and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` (which is being added). The specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, but it's known that `mask` has the j-th bit set and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, indicating that the condition for the update is satisfied. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is increased based on the previous state.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it**
