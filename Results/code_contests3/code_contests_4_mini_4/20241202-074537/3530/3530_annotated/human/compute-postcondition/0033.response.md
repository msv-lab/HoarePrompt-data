Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a string representing a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is equal to `n - 1`. The values of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the conditions checked in each iteration for all values of `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will have accumulated values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` accordingly, and will be taken modulo `MOD`.**
