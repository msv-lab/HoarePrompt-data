The operation modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. Other variables are not affected directly by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21; `mask` is an integer less than \(2^n\); `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.
