According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes `n` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0. Given that `j` is currently `n - 1`, it indicates that the loop has already executed its last iteration. For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` needs to be reset to 0, and `n` must be at least 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `j` is now 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0**
