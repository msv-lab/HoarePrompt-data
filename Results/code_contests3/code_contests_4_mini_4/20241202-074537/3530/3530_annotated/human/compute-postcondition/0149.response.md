According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, `mask` is the next integer (currently less than \(2^n\)), `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
