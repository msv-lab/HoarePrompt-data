The code updates the `dp` array at position `[i][mask]` by adding the value from the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21.
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 21.
- `j` is 1.
- `mask` is in the range from 1 to `1 << n`.

The value `mask ^ (1 << j)` represents flipping the `j`-th bit of `mask`. The previous state of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` is added to `dp[i][mask]`. 

Since we do not have the specific values for `i`, `mask`, or `dp` array states, we cannot determine specific numerical values. However, we can note the change to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`**.
