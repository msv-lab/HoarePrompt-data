The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0s and 1s) that represent compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. It processes these inputs using dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to perfectly match `N` men with `N` women based on their compatibility. The result is printed as the number of perfect matchings modulo 1000000007. If the input is invalid or does not conform to the expected format, the function may not handle these cases, leading to potential errors.
