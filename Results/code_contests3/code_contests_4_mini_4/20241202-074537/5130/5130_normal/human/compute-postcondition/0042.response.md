In this code, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `j` holds the value of `p[2]`, which is not defined in the initial state. However, we know that `comps` is an array or list that is indexed by `j`. The value of `col` is also not defined in the initial state but is stated to be the increased value of `n`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `col` could be at least `n + 1` (if we assume it is simply incremented by 1). The effect of the code is that the value of `col` will be placed into the `comps` array at the index `j`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is the increased value of `n`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is the increased value of `n`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col.**
