`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `n` and `comps[1]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is 1.  
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is 1**
