In the provided code, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is equal to the increased value of `n`, and `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, `i`, `col`, and `comps[j]`. 

Since `col` is the increased value of `n`, we can represent it as `n + 1`. The assignment updates the `comps` array at index `j` with this new value. 

The output does not specify the exact value of `j` or the contents of the `comps` array before the assignment, but we conclude that `comps[j]` is now set to `col`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is `n + 1`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is `n + 1`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.**
