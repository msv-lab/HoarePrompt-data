The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is unknown, but since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 2, the loop is likely executing, indicating `col` is being updated. Therefore, the output state reflects that `col` has increased by 1 while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1**
