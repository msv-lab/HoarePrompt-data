The statement `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` in the `comps` list. The previous state indicates that `comps[p[j]]` is still 0, and `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`. Therefore, the value of `comps[j]` will now hold the value of `col`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is now `p[j]`; `comps[p[j]]` is still 0; `comps[j]` is now `col`.**
