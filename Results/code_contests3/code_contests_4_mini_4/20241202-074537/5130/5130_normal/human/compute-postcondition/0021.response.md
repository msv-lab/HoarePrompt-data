According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. Since `i` is currently 0 and the loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n`, it can execute one more time if `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

For the loop to execute once more, `n` must still be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
