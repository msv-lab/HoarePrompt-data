`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, after execution, `j` will also be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is its increased value, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is its increased value, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2.**
