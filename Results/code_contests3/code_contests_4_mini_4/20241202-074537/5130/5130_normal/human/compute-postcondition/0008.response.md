The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Given that `col` is 1 and `comps[i]` was previously 0, now `comps[i]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list where `comps[i]` is now 1, and `col` is 1.
