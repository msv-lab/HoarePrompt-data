Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; `comps[i]` is now 1; `col` is 1; `j` is now the final value determined by following the indices from `p` starting with `p[0]` until a previously visited index is reached; `comps[j]` is now `col`, which is 1.**
