`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `col` is not specified, but it has been increased by 1. The value of `i` is 1, so `comps[1]` will be set to the new value of `col`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and there are no other variables affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
