`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list where `comps[i]` is now 1, `col` is 1, and `j` is 0.
