The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is previously assigned as `p[1]`, and it is mentioned that `comps[p[1]]` equals 0. Therefore, `comps[j]` (which is `comps[p[1]]`) will now hold the value of `col`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is now `p[1]`; `comps[p[1]]` is now `col`.**
