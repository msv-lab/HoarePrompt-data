`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is increased by 1 before this assignment, so `col` now has its new value. The previous value of `i` is 2, and since `comps` is being indexed by `i`, the element at index 2 of `comps` will be updated. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is its increased value, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is its increased value, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col.**
