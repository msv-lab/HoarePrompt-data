Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `j` is the last index reached by following the indices in `p` until a non-zero value is found in `comps`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and all indices followed by `j` in `p` have non-zero values in `comps` until a non-zero value is encountered.***
