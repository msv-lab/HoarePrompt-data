Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; if `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps[i]` is updated to 1, `col` is set to 1, `j` is assigned the final value determined by following the indices from `p` starting with `p[0]` until a previously visited index is reached, and `comps[j]` is updated to `col`, which is 1.***
