The code `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` of the list `comps`. Since `comps[j]` was previously `col`, the assignment effectively confirms that `comps[j]` now holds the value of `col`. The values of `n`, `i`, `comps[1]`, `j`, and `comps[p[j]]` remain unchanged or unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is now `p[j]`; `comps[p[j]]` is still 0; `comps[j]` is `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is now `p[j]`; `comps[p[j]]` is still 0; `comps[j]` is `col`.**
