According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. The loop will continue executing as long as the value of `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, which implies that `comps[p[j]]` must not be zero (since `col = n + 1` and `n` is a positive integer). For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. Therefore, we can conclude that `comps[p[j]]` must be adjusted to be 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is `n + 1`; and for the loop to execute one more time `comps[p[j]]` must be 0**
