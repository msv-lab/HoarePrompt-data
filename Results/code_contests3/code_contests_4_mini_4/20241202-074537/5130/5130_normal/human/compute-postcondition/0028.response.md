According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `comps[1]` assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is now `p[1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` must still be 0.

Since `j` is now equal to `p[1]`, we need to ensure that `comps[p[1]]` is still 0. This means we need to adjust either `comps` or `p` to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` remains 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is now `p[1]`; `comps[p[1]]` is now `col` and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must still be 0.**
