The value of `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`, but without knowing the specific value of `p[j]`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `j`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `col`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is `n + 1`; `j` is updated to `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is `n + 1`; `j` is updated to `p[j]**
