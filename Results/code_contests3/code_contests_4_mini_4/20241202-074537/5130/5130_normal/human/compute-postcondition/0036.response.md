According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
