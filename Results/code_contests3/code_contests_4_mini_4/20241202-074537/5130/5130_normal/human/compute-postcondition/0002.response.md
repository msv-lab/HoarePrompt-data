The variable `b` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes an input line of space-separated values, converting each value to an integer. The previous state of `b` is a list of `n` binary integers (0s and 1s). The new state of `b` will reflect the input provided as a list of integers. Since the exact input isn't specified, we note that `b` will now hold a list of integers based on user input, which may or may not consist of binary values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of `n` integers where each element is decreased by 1; `b` is now a list of integers based on user input.**
