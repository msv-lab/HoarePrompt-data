The value of `col` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `col` is 0. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of integers, `comps` is a list of `n` zeros, `col` is 1, and the value of `comps[i]` is equal to 0.
