To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition: `while comps[p[j]] == 0:`. 

The loop will continue to execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. In the current state, we know that `comps[j]` is now 1, and `j` has been updated to `p[j]`. Therefore, we need to consider the value of `p[j]` and the corresponding value in the `comps` array.

1. Since `comps[j]` is now 1, we can infer that `comps[p[j]]` must also be checked. 
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must be 0, which means that `p[j]` must point to an index in `comps` where the value is still 0.
3. Since `j` was updated to `p[j]`, we need to ensure that `p[j]` points to an index where `comps` is still 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `p[j]` points to an index where `comps[p[j]]` remains 0.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `p` is a list of `n` integers; `b` is a list of integers; `comps[i]` is now 1; `col` is 1; `j` is now `p[0]`; `comps[j]` is now 1; for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must be 0.**
