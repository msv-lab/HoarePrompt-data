The function reads an integer `n` and two lists: `p`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b`, which contains binary integers (0s and 1s). It determines the number of distinct connected components in the permutation `p`, returning 0 if there is only one component, or the total number of components plus 1 if the sum of elements in `b` is 0. The function does not explicitly accept parameters but processes inputs from standard input. It assumes valid input as per the stated constraints.
