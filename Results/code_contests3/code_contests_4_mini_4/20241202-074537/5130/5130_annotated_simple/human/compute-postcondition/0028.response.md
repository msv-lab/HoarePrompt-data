According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, but there is no information about the current state of `comps[p[j]]`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state such that `comps[p[j]]` is still equal to 0. 

Since `comps[j]` was assigned the value of `col`, we do not have information about what `col` is, but we need to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` remains 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col` and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be 0**
