According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2.

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 2 in the next iteration). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
