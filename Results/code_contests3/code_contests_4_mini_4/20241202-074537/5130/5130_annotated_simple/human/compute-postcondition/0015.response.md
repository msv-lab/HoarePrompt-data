The statement `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` of the array `comps`. Since `j` was previously assigned the value of `p[j]`, and it is stated that `comps[j]` is currently 0 and `col` is 0, the previous value of `comps[j]` does not change due to this assignment. The values of `n`, `i`, and `col` remain unaffected, and `comps` at index `j` will still be 0 after the assignment. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is 0; `col` is 0; and `comps[j]` remains 0 after assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is 0; `col` is 0; and `comps[j]` remains 0 after assignment.**
