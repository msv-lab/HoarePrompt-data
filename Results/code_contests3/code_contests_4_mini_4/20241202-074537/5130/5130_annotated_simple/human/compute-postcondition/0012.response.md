In the given code, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is previously assigned the value of `p[0]`, which is unknown but reflects a valid index based on the context. The value of `col` is currently 0. Therefore, the assignment will update the value at index `j` of the `comps` array to 0.

The other variables `n`, `i`, and `col` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`; `comps[j]` is 0; `col` is 0.**
