`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this assignment, but we know that `comps[j]` now holds the value of `col`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is `col`; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is `col`; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
