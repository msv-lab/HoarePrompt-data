According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. For the loop to execute, `i` needs to be initialized. The loop will start with `i` equal to 0 for the first iteration. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once.

Thus, the relevant states are:
- `n` is a positive integer (which is already given),
- `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
