`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous values of `comps[j]` and `col` are not provided, but `j` has been assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is now `col`, and `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is now `col`; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`**.
