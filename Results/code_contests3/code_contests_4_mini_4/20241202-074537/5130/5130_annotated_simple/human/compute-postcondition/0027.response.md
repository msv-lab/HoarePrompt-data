The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the specific previous value of `j` is not provided, but it is updated to `p[j]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
