The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The new value of `j` is determined by the current value of `p[j]`, but the exact value of `p[j]` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is `col`; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `comps[j]` is `col`; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]**.
