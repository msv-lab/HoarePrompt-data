Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 and `i` is 2. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col` for all values of `j` encountered in the loop until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0, with `j` being the last value assigned from `p[j]` before exiting the loop, and `col` has been incremented for each iteration of the loop.***
