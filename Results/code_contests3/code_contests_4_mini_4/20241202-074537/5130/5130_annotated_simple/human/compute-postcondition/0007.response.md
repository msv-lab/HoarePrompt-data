The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown since it is not defined in the initial state. The values of `n`, `i`, and the element at index `i` of `comps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `comps` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `comps` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1.**
