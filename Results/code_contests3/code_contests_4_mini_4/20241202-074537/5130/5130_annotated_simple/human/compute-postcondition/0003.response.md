The code creates a list `comps` of size `n`, initializing all its elements to 0. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The previous values of `p` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers derived from the input permutation with each element decreased by 1; `b` is a map object of integers derived from input; `comps` is a list of size `n` initialized with zeros.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers derived from the input permutation with each element decreased by 1; `b` is a map object of integers derived from input; `comps` is a list of size `n` initialized with zeros.**
