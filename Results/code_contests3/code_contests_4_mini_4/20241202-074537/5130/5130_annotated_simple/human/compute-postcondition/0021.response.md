According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
