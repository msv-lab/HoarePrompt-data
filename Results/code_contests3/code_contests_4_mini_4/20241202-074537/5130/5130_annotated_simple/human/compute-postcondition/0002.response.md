The variable `b` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means `b` will be a map object that converts each element from the input string (split by spaces) into an integer. The size of `b` will be equal to `n`, as the input list is expected to have `n` elements. The previous values of `b` are not affected since it is being newly assigned. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers derived from the input permutation with each element decreased by 1; `b` is a map object of integers derived from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers derived from the input permutation with each element decreased by 1; `b` is a map object of integers derived from input.**
