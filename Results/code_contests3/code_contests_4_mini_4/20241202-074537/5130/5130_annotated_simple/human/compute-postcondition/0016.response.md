According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[j]` is 0, which indicates that the condition for the loop to continue is satisfied. However, since `comps[j]` remains 0 after assignment, we need to ensure that the value of `p[j]` points to an index where `comps` is still 0.

To guarantee that the loop can execute one more time, we must ensure that `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0. Thus, we need to ensure the state of `comps` at the index `p[j]` continues to meet this condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`; `col` is 0; and for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` remains 0**
