Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `j` is the last value assigned from `p` such that `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `comps[x]` is `col` for all values `x` that were reached through the indices of `p` starting from the initial value of `j`.***
