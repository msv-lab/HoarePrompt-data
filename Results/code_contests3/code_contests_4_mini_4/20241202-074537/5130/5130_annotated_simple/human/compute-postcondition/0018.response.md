The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is currently 0. As a result, `comps[j]` will now be 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `col`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is updated to the value of `p[j]`; `col` is 0; `comps[j]` is 0**
