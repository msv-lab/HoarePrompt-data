The function `func` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. Here, `n` is a positive integer that defines the length of both `p` and `b`, which is such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, meaning it includes every integer from 1 to n exactly once. The parameter `b` is a list of integers containing only 0s and 1s, and its length is equal to n. 

Based on the provided output, the function processes the inputs and returns a result based on specific conditions or calculations, but the exact return value is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, we can summarize the following:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p`, which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list `b`, which contains only 0s and 1s with a length equal to n.**
