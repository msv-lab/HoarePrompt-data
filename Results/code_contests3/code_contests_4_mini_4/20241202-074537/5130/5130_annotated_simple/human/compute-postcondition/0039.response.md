`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2. Therefore, after execution, `j` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `col`, and `comps[2]`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`; `j` is 2**
