`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The values of `n`, `comps[0]`, and `col` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `comps[0]` is `col`; `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `comps[0]` is `col`; `col` is increased by 1.**
