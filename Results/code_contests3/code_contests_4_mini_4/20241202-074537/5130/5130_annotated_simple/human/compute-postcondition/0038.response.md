`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is increased by 1, but since we do not have the specific value of `col` before the assignment, we cannot determine its exact effect on `comps[i]`. However, `i` is 2, so `comps[2]` will be assigned the new value of `col`. The other variables are not affected, so the output state will reflect the assignment and the increment of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
