The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a valid permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary list `b` of length `n`. It identifies the number of distinct components in the permutation and returns 0 if there is only one component, or the number of distinct components if there are multiple. Additionally, if the sum of the binary list `b` is 0, it adds 1 to the result. Therefore, the function returns the number of distinct components minus one if there are multiple components and the sum of `b` is zero.
