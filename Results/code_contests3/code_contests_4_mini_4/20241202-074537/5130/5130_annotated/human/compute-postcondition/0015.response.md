`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is currently 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected as they are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, `col` is 0, and `comps[j]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, `col` is 0, and `comps[j]` is 0.**
