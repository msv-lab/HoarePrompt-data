`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 1, `j` will also be 1 after execution. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[1]` is 2, `j` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[1]` is 2, `j` is 1**
