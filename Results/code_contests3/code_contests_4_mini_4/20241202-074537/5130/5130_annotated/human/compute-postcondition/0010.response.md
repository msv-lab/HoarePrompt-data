According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Right before the loop, `comps[0]` is equal to the incremented value of `col`, but we do not have information on the current state of `p[j]`. 

Since `j` is 0, we can assume that `p[j]` refers to `p[0]`. For the loop to execute the first time, it is necessary that `comps[p[0]]` must equal 0. 

Therefore, if `comps[p[0]]` is not 0 right now, we need to adjust the state to ensure `comps[p[0]]` is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[0]]` must be equal to 0**
