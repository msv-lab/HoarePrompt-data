Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps` contains the value 2 at all indices reached by following the chain defined by `p` starting from the initial index 1, and `j` is the last index reached by following `p` until `comps[j]` was no longer 0.***
