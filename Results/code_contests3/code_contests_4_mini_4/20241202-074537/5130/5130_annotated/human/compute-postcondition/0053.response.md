The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. Here, `n` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200,000. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a valid permutation of length `n`, where each integer is between 1 and `n`. The parameter `b` is a list of integers of length `n`, consisting of zeros and ones. After executing the function body, the function returns an integer as a result based on the inputs. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a valid permutation list `p`, and a binary list `b`, and return an integer based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a valid permutation list p of length n, and a binary list b of length n, returning an integer based on the inputs.**
