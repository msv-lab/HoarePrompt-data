According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Right before the loop, `j` is 1, so we need to ensure that `p[j]` points to an index in the `comps` array where `comps[p[1]]` is 0. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), we must also ensure that `p[1]` is within the bounds of `comps`, which should be at least `n` in size. Since there are no constraints given about the value of `p[j]` or its relation to `n`, we cannot determine the exact state of `comps[p[j]]` without additional information about the array `p`. 

However, to ensure that the loop executes, we can state that `comps[p[j]]` should be 0. If `comps` has not been initialized, we may also consider that `p[1]` is a valid index.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[1]` is 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time then comps[p[j]] must be equal to 0**
