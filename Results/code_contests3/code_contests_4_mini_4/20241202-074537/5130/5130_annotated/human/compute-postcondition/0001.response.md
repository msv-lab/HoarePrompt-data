The variable `p` is assigned a list comprehension that processes the input from `raw_input()`. Each value `v` from the input is converted to an integer, decreased by 1, and stored in the list `p`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, and `p` is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, so the values of `p` will be integers from 0 to `n-1` after the conversion. The list `b` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers of length `n` consisting of zeros and ones.**
