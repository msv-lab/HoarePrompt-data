The variable `b` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will take input from the user, split it into separate strings, convert each string into an integer, and create an iterable map object. The previous values of `n` and `p` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a mapped iterable of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a mapped iterable of integers based on user input.**
