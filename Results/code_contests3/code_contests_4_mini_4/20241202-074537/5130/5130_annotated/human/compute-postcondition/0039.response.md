`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `n`, `col`, and `comps[2]` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
