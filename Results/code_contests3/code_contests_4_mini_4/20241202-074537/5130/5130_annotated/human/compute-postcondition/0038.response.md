`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not known. The value of `i` is 2, so `comps[2]` is updated to the new value of `col`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
