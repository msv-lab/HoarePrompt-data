`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0 and `col` has been increased by 1, so `comps[0]` will now hold the value of `col`. Since we do not have the specific value of `col`, we can only state that `comps[0]` is now equal to the incremented value of `col`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to the incremented value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to the incremented value of `col`**
