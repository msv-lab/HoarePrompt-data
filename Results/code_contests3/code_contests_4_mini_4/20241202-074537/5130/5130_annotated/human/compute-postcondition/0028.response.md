According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute again as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `comps[j]` is assigned the value 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]` must still be equal to 0. 

Since `j` is equal to `p[j]`, we need to ensure that `comps[j]` (which is `comps[p[j]]`) remains 0 for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `comps[p[j]]` is 0, while keeping the other states unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[1]` is 2, `j` is equal to `p[j]`, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
