According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be less than `n`, which will still be true as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**.
