The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is currently 0. The other variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `col` remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing this line, the state of the program will reflect that `comps[j]` now holds the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, `col` is 0, and `comps[j]` is 0**.
