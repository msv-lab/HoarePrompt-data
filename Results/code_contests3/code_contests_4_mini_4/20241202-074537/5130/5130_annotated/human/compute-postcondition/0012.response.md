`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is equal to `p[0]`, and `comps[j]` is currently 0. After execution, `comps[j]` will now be equal to `col`, while the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is `p[0]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is `p[0]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`**.
