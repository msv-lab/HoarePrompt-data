The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown. The other variables are not affected, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `i` is 2, we confirm that the loop can execute a second time. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1.**
