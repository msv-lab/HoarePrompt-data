`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` is increased by 1, so its value is now 2. Since `i` is 1, `comps[1]` receives the value of `col`, which is now 2. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, and `comps[1]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, and `comps[1]` is 2**
