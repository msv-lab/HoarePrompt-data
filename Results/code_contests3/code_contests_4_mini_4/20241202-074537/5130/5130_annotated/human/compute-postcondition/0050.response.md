Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `i` is 2. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps[j]` has been assigned the final value of `col` for each index visited by `j`, `j` is equal to the last value of `p[j]` where `comps[p[j]]` was still 0, and `col` has been increased by the number of iterations executed in the loop.***
