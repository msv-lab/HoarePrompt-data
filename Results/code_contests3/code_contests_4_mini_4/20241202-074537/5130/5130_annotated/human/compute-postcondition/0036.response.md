According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` compared to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, which will still hold true since `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
