According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 0. The other variables `p`, `b`, `comps`, and `col` do not affect whether the loop can execute or how it behaves within the loop, as they are not directly related to the loop control variable.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to initialize `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
