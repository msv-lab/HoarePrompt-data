`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to the incremented value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to the incremented value of `col`**
