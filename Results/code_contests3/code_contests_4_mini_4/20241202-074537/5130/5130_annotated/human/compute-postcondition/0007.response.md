The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, the value of `comps[i]` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, the value of `comps[i]` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1.**
