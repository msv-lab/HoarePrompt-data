The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is not specified. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, and `col` is increased by 1**
