The variable `col` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a mapped iterable of integers based on user input; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros; `col` is 0.
