You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Everybody knows of [spaghetti sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_sort). You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself, but as you survey your pantry you realize you're out of spaghetti! The only type of pasta you have is ravioli, but you are not going to let this stop you...

You come up with the following algorithm. For each number in the array ai, build a stack of ai ravioli. The image shows the stack for ai = 4.

<image>

Arrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array. Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.

At first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn't always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.

Given an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the size of the array.

The second line of input contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the elements of the array.

Output

Output "YES" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and "NO" if it can not.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

3
3 1 2


Output

NO

Note

In the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the array, followed by n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) that represent the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = input()
    flag = True
    nums = map(int, raw_input().split())
    while flag and nums:
        for i in xrange(len(nums) - 1):
            if abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2:
                flag = False
                break
        
        nums.remove(max(nums))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is False if any two consecutive integers in `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more; otherwise, `flag` is True; `nums` is empty after all maximum values have been removed.
    print['NO', 'YES'][flag]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the array, followed by `n` space-separated integers. It checks if any two consecutive integers in the list have an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair exists, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function continuously removes the maximum value from the list until it is empty or the condition is violated. However, there is a missing check for the case when `n` is 0, which is not handled as the input constraints indicate that `n` will always be between 1 and 10. Therefore, the function assumes valid input without error handling for invalid cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
