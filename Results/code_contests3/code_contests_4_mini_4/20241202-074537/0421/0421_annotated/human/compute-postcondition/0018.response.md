The `nums.remove(max(nums))` operation will remove the maximum integer from the list `nums`. The previous state of `nums` is not specified, but it contains at least one integer since `n` is a valid input string that generates integers. The value of `flag` remains unaffected by this operation, and `i` is also unchanged as the operation does not involve indexing or altering `i`.

After executing the code, the output state reflects the removal of the maximum value from the `nums` list while maintaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False if any absolute difference of consecutive integers is greater than or equal to 2, else `flag` is True, and `i` is the last index checked (which is at most `len(nums) - 2`), and the maximum integer has been removed from `nums`.**
