Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is set to False; `nums` is not empty; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1` and `i` is incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop.***
