According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute again if both conditions are satisfied: `flag` must be True, and `nums` must not be empty.

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False if any absolute difference of consecutive integers is greater than or equal to 2, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be adjusted to True. 

Additionally, since the maximum integer has been removed from `nums`, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty (which it is assumed to be at this moment) for the loop to run again. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `flag` must be True (indicating that all absolute differences of consecutive integers are less than 2).
2. `nums` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, for the loop to execute again `flag` is True and `nums` must not be empty**.
