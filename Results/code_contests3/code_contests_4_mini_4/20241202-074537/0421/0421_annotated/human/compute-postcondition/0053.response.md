The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters since it takes input directly from standard input. It reads an integer `n` that represents the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` that represent the elements of the array. 

Based on the output description, the function processes the input values but does not specify what return value or output is generated from this input. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and n space-separated integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) from standard input, but the specific output or return value is not defined.**
