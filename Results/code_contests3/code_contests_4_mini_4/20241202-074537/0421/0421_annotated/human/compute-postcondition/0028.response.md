Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is set to False; `nums` is not empty; if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop. There is no else part in the code.***
