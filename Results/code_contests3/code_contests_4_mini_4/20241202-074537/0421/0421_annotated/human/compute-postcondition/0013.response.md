According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which means the maximum value for `i` should be `len(nums) - 2` for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 2, and the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 3.**
