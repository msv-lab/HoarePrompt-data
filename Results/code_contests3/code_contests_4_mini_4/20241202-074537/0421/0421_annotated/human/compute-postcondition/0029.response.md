According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the current element in `nums`, and since `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would need to be increased by 1 for the next iteration. Consequently, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(nums) - 1` must hold true, meaning `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is set to False; `nums` is not empty; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1` and `i` is incremented by 1.**
