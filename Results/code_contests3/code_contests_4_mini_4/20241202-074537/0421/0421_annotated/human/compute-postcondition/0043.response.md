The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1; `flag` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
