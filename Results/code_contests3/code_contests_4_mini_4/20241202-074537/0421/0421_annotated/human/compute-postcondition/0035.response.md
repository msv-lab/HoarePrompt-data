To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to assess the conditions specified in the `while` statement: `flag and nums`. 

1. The condition `flag` must be `True` for the loop to continue. Since `flag` is either `True` or `False` at the end of the last iteration, if it is currently `False`, it needs to be adjusted to `True` for the loop to execute again.

2. The condition `nums` must be non-empty (i.e., it must contain at least one element) for the loop to run. The statement indicates that `nums` has the maximum value removed, but we don't know the size of `nums` or its contents after that removal. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty and contains at least one element.

Given this analysis, if `flag` is `False`, it must be adjusted to `True`, and if `nums` is empty, it must be adjusted to contain at least one integer.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; for the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` must not be empty.**
