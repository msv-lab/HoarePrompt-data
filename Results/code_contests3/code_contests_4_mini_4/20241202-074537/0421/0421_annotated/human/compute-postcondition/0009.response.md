According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `len(nums)` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again if `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 1**
