Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, where `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop.***
