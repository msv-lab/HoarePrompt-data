The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, where `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
