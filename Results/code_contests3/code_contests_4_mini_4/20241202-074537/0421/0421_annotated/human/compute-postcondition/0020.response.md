According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. The loop will iterate as long as `len(nums) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Since the initial state mentions that `nums` must not be empty, this condition is already satisfied. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

Furthermore, the loop will execute again only if `flag` is True. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need `flag` to be True.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
