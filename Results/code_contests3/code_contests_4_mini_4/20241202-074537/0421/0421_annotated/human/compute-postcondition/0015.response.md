The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 3; `flag` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop.
