Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, and `nums` is not empty. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `i` is incremented to `i + 1` and `flag` remains False while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
