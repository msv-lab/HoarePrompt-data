According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the `nums` list, which contains at least one integer. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at a value less than `len(nums) - 1` because the loop is designed to stop before reaching the last index. 

Given that `flag` is False and the condition to increment `i` is based on the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, it indicates that the loop can still execute if `i` is within the bounds. If `i` was just incremented to `i + 1` and the loop is supposed to execute again, we expect `i` to have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to its next value, which would be `i + 1`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` does not reach `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, where `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`.**
