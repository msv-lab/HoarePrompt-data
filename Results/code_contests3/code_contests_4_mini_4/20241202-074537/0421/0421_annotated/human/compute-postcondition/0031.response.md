The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is set to False; `nums` is not empty; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1` and `i` is incremented by 1; `flag` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop.
