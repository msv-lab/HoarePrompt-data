According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `nums` list and the current index `i`. The loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still within the bounds of the list, and since `nums` is not empty, it has at least one element. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will become `i + 1`, which means `i` will be equal to its current value plus one. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i + 1` is still less than the length of `nums`, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, for the loop to execute one more time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`.**
