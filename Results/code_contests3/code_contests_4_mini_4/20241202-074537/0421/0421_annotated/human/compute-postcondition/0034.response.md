The `max(nums)` function finds the maximum value in the list `nums`, and then `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes that maximum value from the list. This operation modifies the `nums` list, but does not affect the other variables, `n` and `flag`. The output state will reflect the change in `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is either True or False depending on whether all consecutive elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2; `nums` has the maximum value removed.**
