The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid input string that generates at least one integer in `nums`; `flag` is set to False; `nums` is not empty; `i` is now `k + 1`; `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
