The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of the array, followed by `n` space-separated integers. It checks if any two consecutive integers in the list have an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair exists, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function continuously removes the maximum value from the list until it is empty or the condition is violated. However, there is a missing check for the case when `n` is 0, which is not handled as the input constraints indicate that `n` will always be between 1 and 10. Therefore, the function assumes valid input without error handling for invalid cases.
