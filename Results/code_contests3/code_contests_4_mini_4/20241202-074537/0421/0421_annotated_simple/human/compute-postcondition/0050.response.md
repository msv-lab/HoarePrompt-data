The `max(nums)` function identifies the maximum value in the list `nums`, and the `remove` method removes the first occurrence of this maximum value from the list. The values of `n` and `flag` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the removal of the maximum element from `nums`, while the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is False if any adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more, otherwise `flag` remains True; `nums` is the list after removing the maximum value.**
