To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop statement: `while flag and nums:`.

1. The loop can execute if both `flag` is `True` and `nums` is a non-empty array.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `flag` is currently `False` if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `flag` needs to be changed to `True`, indicating that all absolute differences between consecutive elements in `nums` must be less than 2.
3. Additionally, `nums` must remain non-empty.

Thus, to allow for one more execution of the loop, we need to adjust `flag` to `True`, assuming the current conditions allow us to do so, and ensure that `nums` continues to be non-empty.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is True, and `nums` is non-empty**
