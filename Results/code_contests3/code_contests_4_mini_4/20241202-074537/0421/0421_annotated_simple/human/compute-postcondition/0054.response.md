Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers from input. It checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is less than 2. If it finds such a difference, it continues removing the maximum element from the list until it is empty or finds an invalid difference. The function prints 'YES' if all differences are valid and 'NO' if it finds an invalid difference. However, it does not handle cases where the input may not be a valid integer or where `n` is outside the specified bounds (1 to 10).**
