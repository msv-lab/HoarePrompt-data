The function `func` accepts no parameters explicitly, as it is designed to read input directly within the function. The input consists of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` (where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the elements of the array. After processing this input, the function outputs a result based on the provided integers.

Since the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information, we will summarize the input structure. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read an integer `n` and an array of integers `ai` from input, where `n` defines the size of the array and each `ai` is an integer within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n representing the size of an array and n space-separated integers as elements of the array, all taken from input.**
