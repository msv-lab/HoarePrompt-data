According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2, meaning `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Thus, `i` will become 2.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is False, `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
