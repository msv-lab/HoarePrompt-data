The `remove` method is called on the list `nums`, which modifies `nums` by removing the first occurrence of the maximum value in the list. This will change the contents of `nums`, and since `nums` has at least 2 elements, it will still contain at least 1 element after the execution of this line. The variable `flag` is not affected by this operation, and `i` will need to be recalculated based on the new length of `nums` after the maximum value is removed.

After executing `nums.remove(max(nums))`, the new length of `nums` will be `len(nums) - 1`, and thus `i` will be updated to `len(nums) - 1 - 2`, which simplifies to `len(nums) - 3`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated contents of `nums`, the unchanged status of `flag`, and the updated value of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is either True or False depending on the values in `nums`, `nums` is an array with one element removed (the maximum value), `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 3` if the loop completes without breaking.**
