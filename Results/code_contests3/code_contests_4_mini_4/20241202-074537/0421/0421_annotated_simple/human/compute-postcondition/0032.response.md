Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is False, `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
