Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is set to False, and `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
