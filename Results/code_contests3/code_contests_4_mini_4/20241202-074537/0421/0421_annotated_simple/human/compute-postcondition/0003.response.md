According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, but we need to ensure that `nums` contains elements. Since `nums` is a map object created from an input string, it is necessary to ensure that the input string is not empty, as an empty string would lead to an empty `nums`. Therefore, the input string must contain at least one element for `nums` to be non-empty.

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array and must not be empty for nums to be non-empty, `flag` is True**
