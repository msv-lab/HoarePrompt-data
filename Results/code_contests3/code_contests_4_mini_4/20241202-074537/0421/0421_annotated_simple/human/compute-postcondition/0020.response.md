According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len(nums) - 1`. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 1` is greater than 0. Since `i` is initialized to `len(nums) - 3`, we need to ensure that `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1 for the loop to execute, which means `len(nums)` must be at least 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 2 elements before the first iteration. Additionally, `i` should be adjusted to the initial value of the loop, which is `0` at the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is True, `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
