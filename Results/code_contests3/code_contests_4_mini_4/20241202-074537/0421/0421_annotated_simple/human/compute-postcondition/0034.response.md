The `max(nums)` function identifies the maximum value in the `nums` array, and `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes the first occurrence of that maximum value from the array. The removal of the element will affect the `nums` array, but the other variables `n` and `flag` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is at least 2, otherwise `flag` is True, and `nums` is the array with the maximum element removed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements in `nums` is at least 2, otherwise `flag` is True, and `nums` is the array with the maximum element removed.**
