Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is either True or False depending on the values in `nums`, `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements if the loop executes, and `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking. If the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in `nums` is less than 2 for all pairs, `flag` remains True; otherwise, it is set to False.**
