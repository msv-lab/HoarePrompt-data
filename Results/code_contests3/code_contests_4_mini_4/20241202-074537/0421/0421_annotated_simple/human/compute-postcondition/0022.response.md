The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is False, `nums` is an array with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
