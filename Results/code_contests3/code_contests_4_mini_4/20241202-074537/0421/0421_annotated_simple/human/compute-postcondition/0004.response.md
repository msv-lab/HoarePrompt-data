According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `nums` is at least 2, since it iterates from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. For `nums` to be non-empty, the input string `n` must not be empty and should represent a valid number. Therefore, `n` must be a valid non-empty string that can be converted to a non-negative integer, and `nums` should contain at least 2 elements. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute the first time. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing a valid number, `flag` is True, nums is an array with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
