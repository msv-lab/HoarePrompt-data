The program provided does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement, and thus does not meet the requirements.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

2. **Logic for Sliding Ravioli**: The algorithm is supposed to check for the condition where two stacks of ravioli differ in height by two or more, which affects the ability to sort the array. However, the program checks for this condition only in a single iteration before removing any elements from `nums`. It does not properly account for the effect of the sliding ravioli after a stack is removed, which could lead to incorrect outcomes.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop that checks for differences between consecutive elements (`for i in xrange(len(nums) - 1)`) will not account for changes in the list `nums` after removing elements. Once an element is removed, the indices and values change, and the next iteration should reflect that.

4. **Early Termination**: The loop continues while `flag` is `True`, which means if it ever finds a pair of stacks that differ by 2 or more, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. However, the algorithm does not fully simulate the removal of stacks and the subsequent sliding of ravioli, which is crucial for correctly determining if the array can be sorted.

5. **Output Logic**: The output logic uses `print['NO', 'YES'][flag]`, which is incorrect due to the use of brackets instead of parentheses. It should be `print(['NO', 'YES'][flag])`.

Due to these issues, the program fails to correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the described procedure.

Correctness: **False**
