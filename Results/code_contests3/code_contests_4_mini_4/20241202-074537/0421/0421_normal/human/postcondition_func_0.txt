The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). It checks if any adjacent pair of numbers in the list has an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair exists, it returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES'. The function continues checking until the list is empty, removing the maximum value in each iteration. However, the result may not accurately reflect all pairs due to the removal of maximum values and may not handle cases where there are fewer than two elements properly.
