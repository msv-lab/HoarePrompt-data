According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is True, which means that the condition regarding adjacent elements is satisfied. However, since `nums` is not empty, it indicates that there are still elements to process.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `flag` remains True and that `nums` continues to have elements. Since the maximum value has already been removed from `nums`, we need to ensure that the remaining elements still satisfy the condition of `flag`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `flag` remains True for the next iteration. The state does not require any specific changes related to `nums` since it is already not empty, but the internal condition for `flag` must still hold.

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, and for the loop to execute again `flag` must remain True with the condition on adjacent elements satisfied**
