The code uses the `print` function to output either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`. Since `flag` is defined as False if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, and True otherwise, the output will depend on its current value. 

Given that `flag` is either True or False, the output will be 'YES' if `flag` is True and 'NO' if `flag` is False. Other variables (`n` and `nums`) do not affect the output of this specific line.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array; `flag` is either True or False; `nums` is empty; output is 'NO' if flag is False and 'YES' if flag is True.**
