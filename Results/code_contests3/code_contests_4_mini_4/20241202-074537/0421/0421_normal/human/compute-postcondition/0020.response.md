According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` array. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, which means that `len(nums)` must be at least 1. Given that `nums` must not be empty, this condition is satisfied.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the first iteration index. 

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` starts at 0, and since `nums` is not empty, we can indicate that its length is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
