According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, so it will not need adjustment. However, `nums` is an iterable from input, and for the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element (i.e., it should not be empty). Therefore, `nums` must be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty**
