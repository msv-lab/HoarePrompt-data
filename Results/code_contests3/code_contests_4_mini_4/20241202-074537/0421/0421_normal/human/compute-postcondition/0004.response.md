According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` array. The loop will execute if `nums` is not empty, which means its length must be at least 2 to ensure that `len(nums) - 1` is non-negative, allowing the loop to iterate at least once. Additionally, the variable `i` needs to be initialized for the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
