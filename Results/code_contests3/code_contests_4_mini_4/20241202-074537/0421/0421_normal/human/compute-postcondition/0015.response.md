The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
