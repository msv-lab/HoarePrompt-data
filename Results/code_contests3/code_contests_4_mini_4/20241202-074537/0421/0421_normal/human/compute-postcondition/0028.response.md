Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, the internal loop continues executing.***
