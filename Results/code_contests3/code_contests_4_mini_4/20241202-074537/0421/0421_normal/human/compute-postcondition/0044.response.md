Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop breaks. If the condition is not met, the loop continues execution.***
