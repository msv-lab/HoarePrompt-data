The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and `i` has been incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
