The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, which is already its initial state. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. Since the loop is set to execute a second time with `i` being `len(nums) - 1`, it indicates that the loop will continue but the value of `flag` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` in the next iteration.**
