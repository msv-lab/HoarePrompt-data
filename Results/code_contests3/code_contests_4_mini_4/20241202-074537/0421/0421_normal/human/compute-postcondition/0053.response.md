The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters, as it reads input directly from the standard input. The input consists of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_i` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) which represent the elements of the array. After processing this input, the function produces an output based on the specified logic (not detailed here). 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` indicating the size of an array, followed by `n` integers, and it returns a result based on the processing of these input values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by n space-separated integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
