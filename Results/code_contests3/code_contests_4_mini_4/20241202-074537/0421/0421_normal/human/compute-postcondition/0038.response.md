The value of `flag` is changed from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `len(nums)`, `i`, and the absolute difference condition) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the adjacent elements in `nums` at indices `i` and `i + 1` is greater than or equal to 2.
