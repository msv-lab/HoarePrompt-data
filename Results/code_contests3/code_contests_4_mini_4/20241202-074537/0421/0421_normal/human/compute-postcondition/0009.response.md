According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that it is less than `len(nums) - 1`, and `nums` has at least 2 elements. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, it must be true that `i + 1` is still less than or equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

Thus, if `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, the loop can execute for the last time since `i + 1` will equal `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1` and `i` is `len(nums) - 2`.**
