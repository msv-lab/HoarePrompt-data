The `remove` method is called on the `nums` list, which removes the first occurrence of the maximum value in the list. The state of the variable `nums` will change accordingly as one element is removed from it. The other variables `n`, `flag`, and `i` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is either True or False depending on whether all consecutive elements in `nums` have an absolute difference less than 2, `nums` has one element removed (the maximum value), `i` is `len(nums) - 1` if the loop executed to completion.**
