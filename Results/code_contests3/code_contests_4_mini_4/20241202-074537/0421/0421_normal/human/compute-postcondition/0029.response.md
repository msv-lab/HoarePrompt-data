According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` array and the current value of `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. 

Furthermore, the loop condition checks if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is less than 2 to continue. Since the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which means that `len(nums)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to run a second time. 

State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**
