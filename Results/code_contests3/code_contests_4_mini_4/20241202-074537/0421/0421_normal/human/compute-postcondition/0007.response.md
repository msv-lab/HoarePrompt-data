The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
