Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
