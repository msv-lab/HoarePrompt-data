The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` in the next iteration, and we break out of the most internal loop.
