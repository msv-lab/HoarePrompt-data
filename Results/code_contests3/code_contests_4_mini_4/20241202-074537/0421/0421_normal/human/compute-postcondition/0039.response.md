The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the adjacent elements in `nums` at indices `i` and `i + 1` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
