The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal block of code we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
