Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is set to False, and `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements. If the absolute difference between the adjacent elements in `nums` at indices `i` and `i + 1` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
