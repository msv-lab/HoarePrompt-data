The variable `nums` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string representing space-separated numbers and `map(int, ...)` converts those strings into integers. The value of `n` does not affect the output state, and `flag` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array; `flag` is True; `nums` is an iterable of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array; `flag` is True; `nums` is an iterable of integers from input.**
