The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, but it is already `False` in the initial state, so there is no change. The other variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
