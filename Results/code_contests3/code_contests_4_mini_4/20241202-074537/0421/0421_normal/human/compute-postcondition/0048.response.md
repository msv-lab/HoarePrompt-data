Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
