Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. This would cause a runtime error if the program were to be executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Mapping Issue**: The line `n = map(int, raw_input().split())` is incorrect because it attempts to map the input into a variable `n` which is later treated as an integer. The map returns an iterable which is not directly converted to an integer. In Python 3, you would need to convert it to a list first.

3. **Substring Reversal Logic**: The program only checks if there exists any pair of adjacent characters where the first is greater than the second (i.e., `c[i] > c[i + 1]`). While this is a necessary condition to find a place to reverse a substring, it does not guarantee that reversing the substring will always yield a lexicographically smaller string. The program fails to validate if the substring reversal actually produces a smaller string in some cases.

4. **Output Indices**: The program outputs two indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, which only represent a substring of length 2 (the two adjacent characters). However, the problem description allows for any substring to be reversed, which could be longer than 2 characters. Thus, the program does not explore all possible substrings that could lead to a lexicographically smaller string.

5. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not consider cases where the string is already sorted or contains repeated characters that do not allow for a smaller lexicographic outcome upon any reversal.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.
