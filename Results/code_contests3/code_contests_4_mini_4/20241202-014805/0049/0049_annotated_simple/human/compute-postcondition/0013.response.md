According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, after incrementing `i` by 1, it will be 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3**
