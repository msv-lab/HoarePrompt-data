According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is at least 1, which means `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 before the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is initialized to 0 before the first iteration.

State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0**
