The value of `n` is reassigned to the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means `n` will now hold a map object that contains the integers parsed from the input string. The previous value of `n` (which was an integer in the range 2 to 300000) is no longer relevant as it is being replaced. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a map object containing integers from input; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
