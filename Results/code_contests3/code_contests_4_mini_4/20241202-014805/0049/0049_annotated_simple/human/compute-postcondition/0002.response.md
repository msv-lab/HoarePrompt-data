The variable `c` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input()`, which captures a string input from the user. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `c` is an input string from raw_input.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters; `c` is an input string from raw_input.**
