`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `n` and `flag` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, and `pos` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2**
