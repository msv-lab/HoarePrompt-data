Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input. If `flag` is True, `pos` is the last index `i` where `c[i]` was greater than `c[i + 1]`, and 'YES' is printed along with `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, it indicates that there does not exist any `i` such that `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, `pos` is undefined, and 'NO' is printed.***
