The function `func` accepts a parameter `n` which is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\) and a parameter `s` which is a string of length \(n\) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the prompt; however, based on the parameters, we can infer that it processes the string `s` in relation to its length `n`. 

Without specific output cases provided, I will summarize the functionality based on the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
