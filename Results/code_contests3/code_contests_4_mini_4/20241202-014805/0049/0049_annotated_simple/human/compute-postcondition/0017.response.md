Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is `n-2` if `n` is greater than 1 (or does not execute if `n` is 1), `flag` is True if there exists any `i` such that `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, otherwise `flag` is False, `pos` is the last index `i` where `c[i]` was greater than `c[i + 1]`, or is undefined if `flag` is False.**
