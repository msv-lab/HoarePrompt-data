`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `n` and `flag` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is 1, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is 1, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is 1**
