Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists an index `i` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based indices of `i + 1` and `i + 2`. If no such index exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, as it assumes `n` is always valid based on the provided constraints.**
