According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the first element of the map object, which is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to increment by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n - 1`, which means `n` must be greater than 2 (since `i` will be 1). 

State: **`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
