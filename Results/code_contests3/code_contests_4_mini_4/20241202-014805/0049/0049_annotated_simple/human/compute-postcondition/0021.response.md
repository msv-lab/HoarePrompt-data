Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of the map object containing integers from input, `i` is `n-2` if `n` is greater than 1 (or is not executed if `n` is 1), `flag` is False, indicating that there does not exist any `i` such that `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and `pos` is undefined since `flag` is False.***
