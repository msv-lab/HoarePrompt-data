Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for adjacent characters in the string where the first is greater than the second (i.e., `c[i] > c[i + 1]`). This means that it may miss scenarios where a substring can be reversed to create a lexicographically smaller string that is not adjacent.

Consider the case where the string is "abcde". In this case, there are no adjacent characters where the first is greater than the second, thus the program would incorrectly output "NO". However, if we reverse the substring "cde" (from indices 3 to 5), we would get "abedc", which is lexicographically smaller than "abcde". 

Thus, the program fails to correctly identify when it is possible to reverse a substring that results in a lexicographically smaller string. This shows that the program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
