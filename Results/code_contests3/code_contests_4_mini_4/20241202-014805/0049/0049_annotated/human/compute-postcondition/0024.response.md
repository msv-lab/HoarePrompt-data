The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. Here, `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints. However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided output information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The return value depends on the internal logic of the function, which is not specified.**
