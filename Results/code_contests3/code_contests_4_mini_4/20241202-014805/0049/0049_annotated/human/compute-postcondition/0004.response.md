According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range starts at 0 and goes up to `n-1`. Since `n` is the first element of the map object of integers, it needs to be confirmed that it is indeed greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
