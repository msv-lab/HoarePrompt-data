According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 (because `i` will be 1 and `n - 1` must be at least 1). 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1**.
