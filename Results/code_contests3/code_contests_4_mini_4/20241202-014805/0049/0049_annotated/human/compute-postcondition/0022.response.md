The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `n`, `flag`, and `pos` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `flag` is False, and `pos` remains undefined, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `flag` is False, `pos` remains undefined, and the output is 'NO'**.
