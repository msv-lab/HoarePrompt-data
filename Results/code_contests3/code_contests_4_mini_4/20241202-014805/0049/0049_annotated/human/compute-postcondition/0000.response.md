The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `n`. This means that `n` will now contain a map object that converts the input strings (from `raw_input().split()`) into integers. The previous state of `n` was an integer, but after this assignment, `n` will no longer hold a single integer but rather a map object that can produce integers. The string `s` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a map object of integers, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
