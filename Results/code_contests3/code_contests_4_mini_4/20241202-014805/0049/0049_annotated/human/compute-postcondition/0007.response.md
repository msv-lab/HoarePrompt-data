`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the value of `c[i]` is greater than the value of `c[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is 0.  
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, the value of `c[i]` is greater than the value of `c[i + 1]`, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is 0**
