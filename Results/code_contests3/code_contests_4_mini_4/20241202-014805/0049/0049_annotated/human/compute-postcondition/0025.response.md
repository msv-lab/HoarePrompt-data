Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists any index `i` such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based positions of these characters (pos + 1 and pos + 2). If no such index exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the output. **
