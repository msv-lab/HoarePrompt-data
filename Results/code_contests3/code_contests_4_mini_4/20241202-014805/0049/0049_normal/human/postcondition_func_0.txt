The function reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one character in `c` that is greater than the following character. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based positions of the two characters; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but outputs results directly.
