The variable `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 0, `flag` is True, `pos` is 0, and the value of `c[i]` is greater than the value of `c[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 0, `flag` is True, `pos` is 0, and the value of `c[i]` is greater than the value of `c[i + 1]**
