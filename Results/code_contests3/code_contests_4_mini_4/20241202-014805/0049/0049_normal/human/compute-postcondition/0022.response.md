The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `flag`, and `pos`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `flag` is False, `pos` is undefined, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `flag` is False, `pos` is undefined, and 'NO' is printed.**
