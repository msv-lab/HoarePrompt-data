`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `flag`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1**
