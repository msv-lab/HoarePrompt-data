The code `c = raw_input()` assigns the value received from the input to the variable `c`. The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by this line of code. The value of `c` will be whatever string is entered by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `c` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `c` is an input string**
