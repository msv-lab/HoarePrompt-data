`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2**
