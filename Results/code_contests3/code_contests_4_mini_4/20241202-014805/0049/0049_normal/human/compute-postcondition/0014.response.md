The value of `flag` is set to `True`. The previous value of `flag` was `False`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state reflects the change in the value of `flag`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 2, `flag` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 2, `flag` is True**
