The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and produces a specific output based on the conditions defined in the function body. However, the exact output logic has not been provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` (of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The specific return value is determined by the logic within the function.**
