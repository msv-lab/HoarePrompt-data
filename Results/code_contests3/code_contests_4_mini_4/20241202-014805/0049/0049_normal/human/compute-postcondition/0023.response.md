Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000. If `flag` is True, indicating that at least one character in `c` is greater than its next character, then `pos` is defined as the last index where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, and the output is 'YES' along with the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, indicating no such character exists, `pos` is undefined and 'NO' is printed.***
