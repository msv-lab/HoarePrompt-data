The values of `t` and `x` are assigned by mapping the input values to floats. The initial values of `T` and `X` are integers within the range of 1 to 100. After the input operation, `t` and `x` will hold the float values of the integers `T` and `X`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float representing `T`; `x` is a float representing `X`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float representing `T`; `x` is a float representing `X`.**
