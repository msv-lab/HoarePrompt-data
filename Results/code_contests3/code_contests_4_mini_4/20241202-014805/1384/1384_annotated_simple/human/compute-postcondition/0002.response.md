The function `func` accepts two parameters: `T` and `X`. Both `T` and `X` are integers with the constraints that 1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100. The function does not return a specific output based on the described parameters, as the output has not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integer parameters, `T` and `X`, within the specified ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters T and X, both of which are integers within the range of 1 to 100.**
