Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. According to the problem, while studying for T hours in World B, Taro experiences time passing at a rate X times faster than in World A. Therefore, the correct formula to determine how many hours pass in World A while Taro studies in World B should be:

\[ \text{Hours in World A} = \frac{T}{X} \]

However, the program incorrectly reads the input values as floats and uses the division operation `t / x` without properly converting `T` and `X` back to integers or using the correct logic. 

The input parsing is done correctly, but the logic for calculating the hours that pass in World A is not correctly implemented. The expected output should represent the time that passes in World A, which is defined by the formula \( \frac{T}{X} \) - given that T and X are integers, the output must be formatted to meet the precision requirements specified (absolute or relative error of at most \( 10^{-3} \)).

Thus, the program does not accurately follow the requirements of the problem description, resulting in a false correctness assessment.
