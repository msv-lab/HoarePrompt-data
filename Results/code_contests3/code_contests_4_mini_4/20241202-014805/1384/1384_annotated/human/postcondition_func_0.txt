The function accepts no parameters and reads two floating-point numbers from input, `t` and `x`, which are expected to be within the range of 1 to 100. It then prints the result of the division `t / x`. However, it does not handle the case where `x` is zero, which would lead to a division by zero error, nor does it validate that the inputs are within the specified range or of the correct type.
