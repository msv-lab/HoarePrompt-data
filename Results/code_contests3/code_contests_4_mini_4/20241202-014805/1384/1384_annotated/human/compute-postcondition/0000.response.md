The code `t, x = map(float, input().split())` takes two space-separated input values and converts them into floats. Since `T` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `X` is also an integer between 1 and 100, the resulting values of `t` and `x` will be float representations of those integers. The previous values of `T` and `X` are not directly affected since they are not modified, but `t` and `x` will now hold the float equivalents of the input values.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100; `t` is a float representation of T; `x` is a float representation of X.**
