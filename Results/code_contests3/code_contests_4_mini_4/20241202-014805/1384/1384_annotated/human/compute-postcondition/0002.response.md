The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, and `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100. However, since `func` does not take any parameters, we cannot determine the relationship of inputs to the output based on the provided constraints. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot ascertain what the function returns.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the output is not specified.**
