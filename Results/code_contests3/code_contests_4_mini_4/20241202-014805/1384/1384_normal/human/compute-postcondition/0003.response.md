Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, T and X, from user input, both expected to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It then calculates and prints the result of T divided by X. However, the function does not handle division by zero, which could occur if X is mistakenly input as zero, despite the initial expectations. Therefore, users should ensure that X is not zero to avoid an error during execution. **
