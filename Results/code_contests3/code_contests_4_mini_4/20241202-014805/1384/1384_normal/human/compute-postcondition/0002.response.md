The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without parameters. However, it is implied that it operates on two integer variables, `T` and `X`, which are constrained to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Since there are no specific output descriptions provided in the output section, we cannot determine the return value or any specific cases based on the provided information.
