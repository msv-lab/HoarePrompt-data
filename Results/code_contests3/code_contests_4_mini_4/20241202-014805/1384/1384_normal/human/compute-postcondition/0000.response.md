The values of `t` and `x` are assigned the values from `input()`, which are converted to floats. However, since `T` and `X` are both integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), after being converted to floats, `t` and `x` will be floating-point representations of those integers. The previous integer values of `T` and `X` do not change, as they are not directly modified. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `X` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a float between 1.0 and 100.0, `x` is a float between 1.0 and 100.0.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `X` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a float between 1.0 and 100.0, `x` is a float between 1.0 and 100.0**
