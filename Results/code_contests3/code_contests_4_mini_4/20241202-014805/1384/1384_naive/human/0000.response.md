Correctness: **False**.

The program has an issue with the input handling. The problem statement specifies that input values \( T \) and \( X \) should be integers, but the program converts them to floats using `map(float, input().split())`. This could lead to incorrect behavior if non-integer values are provided or if the inputs are not handled correctly during rounding when calculating the time passed in World A.

For example, if we input `8 3`, the program gives the expected output of `2.6666666667`. However, if we input `99 1`, the program produces `99.0`, which is not the same format as specified (it should be 99.0000000000). 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 0, which would result in a division by zero error. 

Thus, the program does not correctly adhere to the problem description for all potential inputs.
