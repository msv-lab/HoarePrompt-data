Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B using the formula `t / x`, where `t` is the time spent studying in World B and `x` is the time dilation factor. 

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input values for T and X, which are correctly mapped to floating-point numbers.
2. **Calculation**: The formula used `t / x` is accurate according to the problem description:
   - If Taro studies for T hours in World B, then in World A, the time that passes is indeed T / X.
3. **Constraints**: The constraints (1 ≤ T ≤ 100, 1 ≤ X ≤ 100) are respected, and the output format (floating point precision) is also correctly handled by the program.

The program has been tested against the provided examples, and it produces the expected results without any logical flaws or missing edge cases. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs within the defined constraints.
