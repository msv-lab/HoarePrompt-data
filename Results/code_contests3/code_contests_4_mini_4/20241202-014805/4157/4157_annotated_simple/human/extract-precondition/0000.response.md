Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of trolleybuses; a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6) representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses; d is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6) representing the distance from the depot to the final station; each of the next n lines contains ti and vi, where ti is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) representing the departure time of the i-th trolleybus, and vi is a positive integer (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6) representing the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus, with the constraint that the sequence of departure times is strictly increasing (0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn).**
