Functionality: ** The function processes input data related to multiple trolleybuses, including their departure times, maximum speeds, and the distance from the depot to the final station. It calculates the maximum time taken for all trolleybuses to reach the final station based on their acceleration and speed. The function prints the maximum time for each trolleybus as it processes the input sequentially. It does not accept parameters directly in its signature, instead reading input values from standard input. **
