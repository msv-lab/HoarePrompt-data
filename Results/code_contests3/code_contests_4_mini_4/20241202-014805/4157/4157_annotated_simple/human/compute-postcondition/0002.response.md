According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), the loop can execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, the following states should be noted:
- `n` is a positive integer (already given),
- `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
