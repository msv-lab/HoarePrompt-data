Output State: **`t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`; `n` must be greater than `k + 1`; `i` is `k + 1`; `ti` and `v` are assigned the values from `map(float, raw_input().split())`; `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d > v * v / (2 * a)` else `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.**
