The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value, but we do not have the specific values of `t1`, `ti`, or the previous value of `t`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` is printed with its most recent value, which is the result of the maximum calculation.

Output State: **`t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`**
