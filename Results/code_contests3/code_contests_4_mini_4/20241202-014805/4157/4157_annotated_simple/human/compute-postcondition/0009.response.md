To determine the output state, we must first analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

- The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on a conditional expression that uses the variables `d`, `v`, and `a`.
- The expression checks whether `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. 
- If this condition is true, `t1` is calculated using the formula `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
- If the condition is false, `t1` is calculated using the formula `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since `d`, `v`, and `a` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numeric output for `t1`. However, we know that `t1` will be calculated based on the conditional expression using the existing values of `d`, `v`, and `a`.

The output state will reflect that `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. 

Output State: **`t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`**
