To determine the output state, we need to analyze the assignment of `t` in the provided code snippet. The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum of two values: `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`.

1. **Current Variables**:
   - `t`: the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value.
   - `t1`: calculated based on the provided formula.
   - `ti`: assigned from the input.
   - Previous value of `t` is also needed for the calculation.

2. **Calculation**:
   - Since `t` is updated to `max(t1 + ti, t)`, it will take the greater of the two values.
   - The specific values of `t1`, `ti`, and the previous value of `t` are necessary to determine the new value of `t`.

However, as the specific values for these variables are not provided in the initial state description, we can only describe their relationship.

Output State: **`t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value; `t1` is calculated as per the given formula; `ti` is assigned from input, and the previous value of `t` is retained.**
