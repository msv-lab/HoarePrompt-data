The line of code `ti, v = map(float, raw_input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into separate strings, and converts those strings into floats, assigning them to the variables `ti` and `v`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the variables that have been defined and the new assignments made.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input**
