According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value, which is not specified but will be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. The loop counter `i` in `xrange(n)` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.

Assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` would be `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, and `i` is `k + 1`**
