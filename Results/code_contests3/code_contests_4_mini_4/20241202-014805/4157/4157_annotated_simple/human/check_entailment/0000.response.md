Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement for several reasons:

1. **Catch-up Logic**: The program does not account for the scenario where one trolleybus may catch up with another. According to the problem description, if a trolleybus catches up with another, they will travel together, and the arrival time must be updated accordingly. The program simply computes the time for each trolleybus independently without considering this catch-up behavior.

2. **Time Calculation**: The calculation of `t1` in the program does not fully conform to the physics described in the problem. While it attempts to calculate the time to reach the final station based on maximum speed and acceleration, it does not handle the case where the trolleybus may reach its maximum speed before needing to decelerate or when it may not reach the maximum speed due to distance constraints.

3. **Output Format**: The output should be printed with a precision that allows for an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-4}\). The program does not specify the formatting of the output, which might lead to precision issues.

4. **Input Handling**: The use of `raw_input()` and `xrange()` indicates that this code is written for Python 2, which may not be compatible with Python 3. While this does not directly affect the logic, it is a technical issue that could lead to runtime errors in a Python 3 environment.

5. **Initialization of `t`**: The variable `t` is intended to track the maximum time of arrival among the trolleybuses, but it is not properly updated to reflect the behavior of the trolleybuses catching up with one another, which is critical for the correct output.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the catch-up logic and the physics of trolleybus movement as outlined in the problem description, leading to potentially incorrect arrival times for the trolleybuses.
