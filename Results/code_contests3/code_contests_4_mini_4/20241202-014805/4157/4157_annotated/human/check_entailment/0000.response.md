Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Calculation of Arrival Time**: The computation of `t1`, which is supposed to represent the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station, does not correctly account for the situation where trolleybuses cannot overtake each other. The formula used does not incorporate the logic needed to handle the case where one trolleybus catches up to another, causing them to travel together.

2. **Handling of Catch-Up Situations**: The program does not check if the current trolleybus catches up with the previous one. If a trolleybus catches up, it should start traveling together with the previous trolleybus at the speed of the slower trolleybus until they both reach the destination. The current logic fails to implement this crucial aspect of the problem.

3. **Output Timing**: The program outputs the maximum time `t` for each trolleybus, which does not reflect the individual arrival times of each trolleybus. Instead, each trolleybus's arrival time should be computed based on its departure time and the time taken to reach the destination, while considering the catch-up scenario.

4. **Variable Initialization and Updates**: The variable `t` is intended to keep track of the latest time at which a trolleybus arrives, but it does not accurately represent when each trolleybus arrives, especially in the context of them potentially traveling together.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description for every potential case, particularly in scenarios with multiple trolleybuses where catch-up occurs. Therefore, the implementation is incorrect.
