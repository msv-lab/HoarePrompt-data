The function reads a positive integer `n` and two additional positive integers `a` and `d` from input. It then iterates `n` times, reading pairs of non-negative integer `ti` (departure time) and positive integer `vi` (maximum speed) for each iteration. For each trolleybus, it computes a time `t1` based on the equations involving `a`, `d`, and `v`, and updates the maximum time `t` encountered during the iterations. After processing all trolleybuses, it prints the maximum time `t` for each trolleybus but does not return any value.
