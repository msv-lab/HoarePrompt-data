The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, it utilizes the constraints provided for the variables `n`, `a`, `d`, and the sequences of `ti` and `vi`. 

The function is intended to operate under the following conditions:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses.
- `a` is a positive integer representing a specific parameter related to the trolleybuses.
- `d` is a positive integer representing another parameter related to the trolleybuses.
- For each trolleybus, `ti` is a non-negative integer representing the time it leaves the depot, and `vi` is a positive integer representing its maximum speed. The values of `ti` are strictly increasing.

The output of the function is not specified in detail but is implied to be based on the computations involving the trolleybuses' departure times and speeds. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates with predefined constraints for `n`, `a`, `d`, and sequences of `ti` and `vi`. It processes this information and returns a result based on the computations related to the trolleybuses.**
