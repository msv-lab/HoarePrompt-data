To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the calculations based on the initial state of the variables.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2
- `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6)
- `d` is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6)
- `t` is max(t1 + ti, 0.0)
- `i` is 2
- `ti` is an input float
- `v` is an input float

The code snippet performs a conditional assignment to `t1`:
```
t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
```

1. The condition checks if `d > v * v / (2 * a)`. Since `d`, `a`, and `v` are provided as inputs, we will evaluate the two possible scenarios based on this condition.
2. If the condition is true, `t1` is assigned the value `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
3. If the condition is false, `t1` is assigned the value `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Without specific values for `v`, `a`, and `d`, we cannot derive a concrete numeric value for `t1`, but we can express the state as dependent on the input values.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculation of `t1` based on the conditions evaluated with the initial state.

Output State: **`t1` is calculated based on the condition (d > v * v / (2 * a)); if true, `t1` is v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v; if false, `t1` is math.sqrt(2 * d / a)**
