The code simply prints the current value of `t`. The value of `t` is determined by the calculation involving `t1` and `ti`, but since the specific values or previous calculations of `t` are not provided, we can only state that `t` is printed as is. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value, and we print the current value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value, and we print the current value of `t`.**
