To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code and its effects on the variables involved based on the initial state.

1. The variable `t1` has been calculated based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. Depending on the condition, `t1` can take two possible values.
2. The variable `ti` has an existing value (not specified in the initial state).
3. The variable `t` also has an existing value (not specified in the initial state).

The code snippet `t = max(t1 + ti, t)` will update the value of `t` based on the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.

Since we do not have the specific values for `ti` and `t`, we cannot compute an exact value for `t`. However, we know that `t` will be updated.

The final output state will reflect that `t` has been updated to be the maximum of the two computed values, while `t1`, `ti`, and the previous value of `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1` is calculated based on the condition; `t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value.**
