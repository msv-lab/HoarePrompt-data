n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and for each trolleybus i, ti is a non-negative integer representing the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and vi is a positive integer representing the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6).
