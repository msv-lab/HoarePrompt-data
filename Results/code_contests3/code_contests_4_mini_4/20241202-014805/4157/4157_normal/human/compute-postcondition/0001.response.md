The code takes input values for `n`, `a`, and `d` from the user and assigns them to the corresponding variables. Other variables remain unchanged, and the value of `t` is still 0.0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, `d` is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station, and `t` is 0.0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, `d` is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station, `t` is 0.0**.
