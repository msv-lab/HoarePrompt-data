The function accepts three positive integers: `n` (the number of trolleybuses), `a` (the maximum acceleration), and `d` (the distance to the final station), followed by `n` pairs of non-negative integers `ti` (departure times) and positive integers `vi` (maximum speeds) for each trolleybus. It calculates the time required for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on its departure time and speed, considering the acceleration, and prints the maximum time taken by any trolleybus to reach the station. If the distance can be covered with the given speed and acceleration, it computes the appropriate time; otherwise, it uses a different formula. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it outputs the maximum time for each trolleybus sequentially.
