n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and for each trolleybus, ti is a non-negative integer representing the time it leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and vi is a positive integer representing its maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6) such that the times are strictly increasing (0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn).
