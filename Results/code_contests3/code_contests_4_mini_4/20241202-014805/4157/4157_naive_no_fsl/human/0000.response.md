Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where trolleybuses catch up to each other. The logic only calculates the time for each trolleybus to reach the final station individually, without considering that they must travel together if one catches up to another.

For example, in the first sample case provided, the second trolleybus (which leaves at t=5 with a maximum speed of 11) will catch up to the first trolleybus (which leaves at t=0 with a maximum speed of 10) at a distance of approximately 510.5 meters. According to the problem description, both trolleybuses would then continue at the speed of 10 meters per second until they reach the final station. However, the program does not account for this interaction and instead calculates the arrival times independently.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to account for the possibility of trolleybuses catching up to each other and traveling together, which directly contradicts the problem description.
