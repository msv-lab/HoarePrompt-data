The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, as it is defined without any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates with inputs `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

Given that `n` and `m` are positive integers constrained by \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\), and `a` and `b` are integers constrained by \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\), the function processes these inputs to produce an output. 

Unfortunately, the specific output behavior of the function is not described in the provided information. Therefore, I will summarize the parameters based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function implicitly accepts parameters n (a positive integer), m (a positive integer), a (an integer), and b (an integer). The function's return value is not explicitly defined in the provided information.**
