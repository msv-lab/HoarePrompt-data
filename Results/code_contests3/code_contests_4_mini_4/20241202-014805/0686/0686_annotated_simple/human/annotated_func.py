#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function implicitly accepts four parameters: two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two integers `a` and `b`, but the function body is empty and does not perform any operations or return any values. Therefore, the function does not have any defined functionality or return value.
