#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and does not perform any operations or return any output, despite the annotations suggesting it operates with parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, it effectively does nothing.
