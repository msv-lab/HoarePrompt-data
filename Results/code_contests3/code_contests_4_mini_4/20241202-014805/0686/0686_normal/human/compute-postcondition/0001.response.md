The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided constraints, we infer that it operates with four variables: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers constrained such that \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12} \).
- `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that \( 1 \leq a, b \leq 100 \).

Since the output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information, we cannot ascertain what the function returns based on its input parameters. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is primarily focused on accepting the parameters with the given constraints, but without information on the return value or output behavior.

Functionality: **The function operates with parameters n and m as positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and a and b as integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), but does not return any specified output.**
