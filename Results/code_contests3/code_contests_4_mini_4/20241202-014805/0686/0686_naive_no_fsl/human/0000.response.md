Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not exist (it is represented by `{}`), thus it cannot satisfy the requirements outlined in the problem description. Since there is no implementation of logic to calculate the minimal cost of building or demolishing commentary boxes, we can infer that the program will not produce the correct output for any input case. For example, if we take the input `9 7 3 8`, the correct output would be `15` as explained in the examples. However, the absence of any code means it cannot handle this case or any other case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
