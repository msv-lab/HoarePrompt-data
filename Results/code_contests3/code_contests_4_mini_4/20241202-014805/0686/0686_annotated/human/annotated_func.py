#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not perform any operations or return any value, as the body of the function is empty. Therefore, it effectively does nothing regardless of the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b` which are mentioned in the annotations.
