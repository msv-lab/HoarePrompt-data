Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (assuming the code is intended for Python 3). It should use `input()`.

2. **Extraction Logic**: The logic used to extract letters relies on incrementing the index `k` by 3 (`k = k + 3`) and starting from the second character (`k = 1`). This means the program only considers letters at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., which is incorrect because it will skip letters that are not in these specific positions. For example, given the input `{a, b, c}`, the program will only capture the letter `a` and ignore `b` and `c`.

3. **Handling Empty Set**: The program does not properly handle the edge case where the input is an empty set `{}`. In this case, the program would not add any letters to `Arreglo`, but it does not account for this scenario explicitly, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

4. **Output**: The program counts the unique characters in `Arreglo` and prints the count, but since `Arreglo` may not contain all the letters due to the extraction logic, the count of distinct letters printed does not represent the actual distinct letters in the input string.

Given these points, the program cannot guarantee the correct count of distinct letters as required by the problem statement. Thus, the program fails to fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
