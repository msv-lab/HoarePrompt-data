In the given code snippet, `k` is assigned the value of `k + 3`. The previous value of `k` is 1. Thus, after the execution, `k` will be updated to 4. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with letters separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with letters separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena`; `k` is 4.**
