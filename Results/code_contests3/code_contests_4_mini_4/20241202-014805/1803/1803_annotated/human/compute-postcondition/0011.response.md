The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the previous value of `k` is not specified, we only know that it will increase by 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the loop condition `len(Cadena) > k + 3` will determine if the loop continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is updated by adding the element `Cadena[k]`, `k` is increased by 3, and the loop will execute again if `len(Cadena) > k + 3`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated by adding the element `Cadena[k]`, `k` is increased by 3, and the loop will execute again if `len(Cadena) > k + 3.**
