According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the length of `Cadena`. The loop will continue executing as long as both conditions are true: `len(Cadena) > k` and `len(Cadena) > 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is increased by 3. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the updated value of `k` satisfies the condition `len(Cadena) > k`.

Assuming `len(Cadena)` is currently greater than 2 (as that condition is already met), we can express the relationship needed for the loop to run again. Specifically, we need to ensure that after adding 3 to `k`, it remains less than `len(Cadena)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k + 3`.

State: **`Arreglo` is updated by adding the elements of `Cadena` indexed by `k`, `k` is increased by 3 and for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena) > k + 3`**
