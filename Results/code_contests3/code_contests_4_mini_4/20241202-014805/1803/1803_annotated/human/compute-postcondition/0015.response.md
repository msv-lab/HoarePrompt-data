The function `func` accepts no parameters and processes a string input, which is expected to be a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas and spaces. It extracts every third character from the input string starting from the second character (index 1) and constructs a list called `Arreglo` containing these characters. After this extraction, the function calculates the number of unique characters in `Arreglo` by converting it to a set and then getting its length. Finally, it prints this length.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If the input string has a length of 2 or less (i.e., only contains the curly brackets), `Arreglo` remains empty.
2. The function does not check for the validity of the input format (e.g., ensuring it starts with '{' and ends with '}' or contains valid characters).
3. The function does not handle any exceptions that might arise from the input being malformed or from using `raw_input()` in environments where it might not be defined.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input representing a set of lowercase letters enclosed in curly brackets, extracts unique letters from every third position starting from the second character, and prints the count of these unique letters. If the input is invalid or too short, it may produce unexpected results. **
