In this scenario, the code snippet `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` is executed. 

1. `Cadena` is a string that represents a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with letters separated by a comma and a space. For the loop to execute the first time, `Cadena` must be longer than 2 characters, meaning it must contain at least one letter, and the enclosing characters (curly brackets) contribute to the length as well.
   
2. The variable `k` is initialized to 1, which means that the code is attempting to access the second character in the string `Cadena`.

3. The list `Arreglo` is initially empty.

4. The code `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` appends the character at index `k` (which is 1) of `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`.

5. After execution, `Arreglo` will contain one element, which is the second character from `Cadena`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `Cadena` but it must be longer than 2 characters, we can specify the output state based on the information provided.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with letters separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` contains the character at index 1 of `Cadena`; `k` is 1.**
