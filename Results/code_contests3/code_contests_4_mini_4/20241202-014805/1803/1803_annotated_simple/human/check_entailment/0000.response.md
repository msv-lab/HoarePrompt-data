Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program is using `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

2. **Indexing Logic**: The logic used to extract letters from the input string is flawed:
    - The program initializes `k` to 1 and then increments it by 3 in each iteration of the loop. This means it is only capturing letters at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., effectively missing any letters that are not located at these specific indices. This will result in missing letters that are present in the input but not at those calculated positions.

3. **Handling of Empty Sets**: While the program does handle the case of an empty set (`{}`) correctly by not adding any letters to `Arreglo`, the way `Arreglo` is filled is still incorrect as explained above.

4. **Output**: The program correctly counts distinct letters using `set(Arreglo)` and prints the length, but since `Arreglo` does not contain all letters, the output will not be accurate.

A specific example where it fails:
For the input `{a, b, c}`, the program would result in `Arreglo` containing only `['a']`, leading to an incorrect output of 1 instead of the correct output of 3.

Thus, due to the incorrect extraction of letters and improper input handling, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
