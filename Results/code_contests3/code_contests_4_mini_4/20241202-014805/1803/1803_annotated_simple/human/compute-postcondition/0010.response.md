The code appends the value of `Cadena[k]` to the list `Arreglo`. Since `k` is 7, and assuming `Cadena` has enough elements (as stated that `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7), we can access `Cadena[7]`. The new state of `Arreglo` will now include this additional element.

The previous value of `Arreglo` is `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4]]`, and after appending `Cadena[7]`, the new value will be `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4], Cadena[7]]`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4], Cadena[7]]`, `k` is 7, and for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7.**
