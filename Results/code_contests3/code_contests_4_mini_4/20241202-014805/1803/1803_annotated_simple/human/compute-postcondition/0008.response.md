`k` is assigned the value `k + 3`. The previous value of `k` is 4, so after execution, `k` becomes 7. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4]]`, `k` is 7.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4]]`, `k` is 7**
