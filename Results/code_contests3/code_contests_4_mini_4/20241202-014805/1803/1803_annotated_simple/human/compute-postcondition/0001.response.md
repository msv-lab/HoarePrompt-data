The variable `Arreglo` is initialized as an empty list, which means that it will hold no elements initially. The value of `Cadena` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is an input string representing a set of small English letters formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", `Arreglo` is an empty list.
