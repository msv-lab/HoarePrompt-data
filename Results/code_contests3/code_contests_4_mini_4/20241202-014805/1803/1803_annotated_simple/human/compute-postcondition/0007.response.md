The code `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` appends the element `Cadena[k]` to the list `Arreglo`. Given the initial state, `Arreglo` is currently `[Cadena[1]]`, and `k` is 4. The state of `Cadena` is not explicitly provided, but since the loop condition mentions that `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4, we can assume `Cadena` has at least 5 elements.

Thus, `Cadena[k]` refers to `Cadena[4]`. After executing the code, `Arreglo` will now contain the original element `Cadena[1]` plus the new element `Cadena[4]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4]]`, with `k` still being 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4]]`, `k` is 4.**
