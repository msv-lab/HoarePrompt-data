To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one time, we need to analyze the conditions: `len(Cadena) > k` and `len(Cadena) > 2`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `Cadena` is an input string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}"
- `Arreglo` is an empty list
- `k` is 1

1. The first condition `len(Cadena) > k` translates to `len(Cadena) > 1`, because `k` is 1. This means that the length of `Cadena` must be greater than 1.
2. The second condition `len(Cadena) > 2` means that `Cadena` must have more than 2 characters.

For the loop to execute at least once, both conditions must hold true simultaneously. If the string `Cadena` contains only 2 characters or fewer, at least one of the conditions will fail.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the length of `Cadena` so that it is greater than 2.

State: **`Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 2**
