The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `k` is 7, after execution, `k` becomes 10. The states of the other variables, including `Arreglo`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4], Cadena[7]]`, `k` is 10, and for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now `[Cadena[1], Cadena[4], Cadena[7]]`, `k` is 10, and for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7.**
