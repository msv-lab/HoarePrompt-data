The function accepts a string input formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", where each letter is a small English letter separated by a comma and a space. It extracts every third letter starting from the second character (index 1), accumulates these letters into a list, and then prints the count of unique letters found in that list. If the input does not meet the expected format or is invalid, it may not function correctly, as there is no error handling for such cases.
