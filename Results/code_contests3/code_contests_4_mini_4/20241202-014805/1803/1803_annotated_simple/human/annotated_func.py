#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string representing a set of small English letters formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space, and the string starts with an opening curly bracket and ends with a closing curly bracket. The length of the string does not exceed 1000 characters.
def func():
    Cadena = raw_input()
    Arreglo = []
    k = 1
    while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
        Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
        
        k = k + 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `Cadena`, `Arreglo` contains the elements at indices 1, 4, 7, ..., up to the maximum valid index of `Cadena` based on the condition that `len(Cadena) > k` and `len(Cadena) > 2`.
    print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string input formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", where each letter is a small English letter separated by a comma and a space. It extracts every third letter starting from the second character (index 1), accumulates these letters into a list, and then prints the count of unique letters found in that list. If the input does not meet the expected format or is invalid, it may not function correctly, as there is no error handling for such cases.
