The value of `k` is updated by adding 3 to its current value. The previous value of `k` is not specified, but it will increase by 3. The other variables, `Arreglo` and `len(Cadena)`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7, and `k` is now `k + 3`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7, `k` is now `k + 3**.
