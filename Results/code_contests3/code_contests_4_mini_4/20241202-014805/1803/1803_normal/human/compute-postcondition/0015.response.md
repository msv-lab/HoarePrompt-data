The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, separated by commas and spaces. The function extracts every third letter from the string starting from the second letter (index 1) and stores these letters in a list called `Arreglo`. After processing the input, it calculates the number of unique letters in `Arreglo` by converting it to a set and then obtaining its length. Finally, it prints this length.

However, the function does not handle cases where the input string is malformed (e.g., not starting with '{' or ending with '}') or when there are fewer than two letters, which may cause it to behave unexpectedly. Additionally, the function does not return a value; it only prints the count of unique letters.

Functionality: ** The function reads a string input formatted as a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, extracts every third letter starting from the second one, counts the number of unique letters from that extraction, and prints the count. It does not handle malformed input or return any values. **
