The variable `Cadena` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes an input string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the assignment of the input string to `Cadena`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, where letters are separated by a comma followed by a space.**
