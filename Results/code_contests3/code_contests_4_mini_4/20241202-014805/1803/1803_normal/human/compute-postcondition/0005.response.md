The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` is initially 1, the new value of `k` becomes 1 + 3 = 4. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters, `Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters, `Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 4**
