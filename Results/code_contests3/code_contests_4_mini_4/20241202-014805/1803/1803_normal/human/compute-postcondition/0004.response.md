`Arreglo` is assigned the value of `Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]`. Since `k` is 1, this means that the second character of `Cadena` (index 1) is appended to `Arreglo`. The previous value of `Arreglo` is an empty list, so after execution, `Arreglo` will contain one element, which is `Cadena[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string representing a set of small English letters, `Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 1**
