In this case, `Arreglo` is being updated by appending the element `Cadena[k]` to it. The initial state indicates that `Arreglo` contains the element `Cadena[1]`, and since `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4, the loop can continue executing. The previous value of `Arreglo` is known (it contains `Cadena[1]`), but we do not know the specific value of `Cadena[k]` since `k` is not defined in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `Arreglo` as it is updated to include the new element but does not specify the exact contents of `Cadena` or the new value of `Arreglo` since we don't know `k` or `Cadena[k]`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, which is unknown; `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.**
