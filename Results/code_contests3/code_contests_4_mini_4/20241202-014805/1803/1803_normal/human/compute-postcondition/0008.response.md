`k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but it will now be `k + 3`. The states of `Arreglo` and `Cadena` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, which is unknown; `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4; `k` is now `k + 3`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, which is unknown; `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4; `k` is now `k + 3`.**
