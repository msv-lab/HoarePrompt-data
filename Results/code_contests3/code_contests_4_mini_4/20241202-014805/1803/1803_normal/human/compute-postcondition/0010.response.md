The code appends the element `Cadena[k]` to the list `Arreglo`. The value of `k` has been updated to `k + 3`, and since `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7, `k` must be a valid index within the bounds of `Cadena`. Therefore, the new value of `Arreglo` will contain the previously existing elements along with the element `Cadena[k]`. 

The states of the other variables are not altered. Consequently, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7, `k` is now `k + 3`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, `len(Cadena)` is greater than 7, `k` is now `k + 3**
