You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given a string S of length N consisting of `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`. Answer the following Q queries:

* Query i (1 \leq i \leq Q): You will be given integers l_i and r_i (1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N). Consider the substring of S starting at index l_i and ending at index r_i (both inclusive). In this string, how many times does `AC` occurs as a substring?

Constraints

* 2 \leq N \leq 10^5
* 1 \leq Q \leq 10^5
* S is a string of length N.
* Each character in S is `A`, `C`, `G` or `T`.
* 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N Q
S
l_1 r_1
:
l_Q r_Q


Output

Print Q lines. The i-th line should contain the answer to the i-th query.

Example

Input

8 3
ACACTACG
3 7
2 3
1 8


Output

2
0
3
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where 2 <= N <= 100000. Q is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries, with 1 <= Q <= 100000. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.
def func():
    N, Q = map(int, raw_input().split())
    S = raw_input()
    P = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(N):
        if i == 0:
            P[0] = 0
            continue
        
        if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC':
            P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            P[i] = P[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a non-negative integer, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` where `P[N]` is the count of 'AC' occurrences in string `S`, and `P[0]` is 0.
    for _ in range(Q):
        l, r = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a non-negative integer; `P` is a list of length `N + 1`; `l` and `r` are two integers assigned from input during each iteration; the printed output is the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` for each pair of `l` and `r` provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `S` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and a non-negative integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It counts occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` and for each query defined by indices `(l, r)`, it returns the total number of 'AC' occurrences in the substring `S[l-1:r-1]` (using 0-based indexing). The output for each query is printed sequentially.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
