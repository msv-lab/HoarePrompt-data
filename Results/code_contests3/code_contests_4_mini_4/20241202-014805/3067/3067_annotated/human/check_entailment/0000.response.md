To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the program and how it aligns with the requirements set forth in the description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program takes a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
2. It is required to answer `Q` queries, each defined by two indices `l_i` and `r_i`, which specify a substring of `S`.
3. For each query, the program must count how many times the substring 'AC' appears in the specified substring `S[l_i:r_i]`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads `N` and `Q` correctly and reads the string `S`.

2. **Counting 'AC' Occurrences**:
   - A list `P` is initialized to store cumulative counts of occurrences of 'AC'.
   - The program correctly populates the list `P` such that `P[i]` contains the count of 'AC' occurrences from the start of the string up to the index `i`.

3. **Answering Queries**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the number of occurrences of 'AC' in the specified substring using the cumulative count array `P`:
     - It computes the count as `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`.
   - This logic is correct because it effectively counts the occurrences of 'AC' in the range specified by `l` and `r`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles substrings correctly since it uses 0-based indexing after converting the 1-based indices given in the queries.
- It takes into account that the substring must be non-empty and that `l_i` is always less than `r_i`, ensuring valid ranges.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as required by the problem description. It efficiently counts occurrences of the substring 'AC' using a cumulative count array, and correctly addresses multiple queries.

Thus, the correctness of the program can be stated as:

Correctness: **True** 

The program fulfills all the requirements of the problem description, handling string inputs, counting occurrences accurately, and providing the correct output for each query.
