The variable `S` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned the first integer from the input, `Q` is assigned the second integer from the input, `S` is assigned a string from user input.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the first integer from the input, `Q` is assigned the second integer from the input, `S` is assigned a string from user input.**
