According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must still be at least 1. 

State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be at least 2**
