The code prints the result of the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. The values of `l` and `r` are provided from input, and they determine the indices used to access elements in the list `P`. The length of `P` is `N + 1`, which means it has valid indices from `0` to `N`.

Assuming `l` and `r` are within the valid range, the expression calculates the difference between the elements at indices `r - 1` and `l - 1` in the list `P`. The output state includes the values of `P[r - 1]`, `P[l - 1]`, and the result of the operation.

Output State: **`P[r - 1]` is the element at index `r - 1` of list `P`, `P[l - 1]` is the element at index `l - 1` of list `P`, and the printed result is `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`.**
