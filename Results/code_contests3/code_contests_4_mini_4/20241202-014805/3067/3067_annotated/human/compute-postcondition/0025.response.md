`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is 2, so `P[2]` will take the value of `P[1]`. The state of `P[1]` is not specified in the initial state, but `P` itself is assumed to be an array or a list where `P[0]` is already defined as 0 if `i` were to equal 0. However, since `i` is not equal to 0 in this case, we do not assign 0 to `P[0]`. The output state will reflect that `P[2]` will now hold the value of `P[1]`, leaving other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]**
