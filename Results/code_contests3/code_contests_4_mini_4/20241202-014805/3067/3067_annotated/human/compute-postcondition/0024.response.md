The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, we need to look at the current value of `P[1]` to determine the new value of `P[2]`. Since `N` is at least 1, `P[1]` is expected to have been initialized already but its exact value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this possibility.

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 2; `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1`**.
