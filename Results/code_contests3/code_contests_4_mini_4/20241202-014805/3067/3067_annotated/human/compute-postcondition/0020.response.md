According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**.
