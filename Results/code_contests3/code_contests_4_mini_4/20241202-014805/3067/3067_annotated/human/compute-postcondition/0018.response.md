`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, this means `P[1]` is set to the value of `P[0]`. The value of `P[0]` is not specified explicitly in the initial state, but it is implied that `P[0]` is set to 0 when `i` equals 0, which does not affect the current assignment since `i` is 1. Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[1]` is now equal to `P[0]`. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0]**
