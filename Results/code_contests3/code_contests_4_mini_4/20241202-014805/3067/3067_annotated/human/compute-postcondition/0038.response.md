The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `Q`. `S` is a string consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', with a length `N` that satisfies the constraint 2 <= N <= 100000. `Q` is a non-negative integer representing the number of queries, constrained by 1 <= Q <= 100000. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, where 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. The function processes these queries to return results based on the specified ranges in `S`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of specific characters and a non-negative integer Q representing the number of queries, and it processes the queries defined by the ranges (l_i, r_i) to return results based on the string S.**
