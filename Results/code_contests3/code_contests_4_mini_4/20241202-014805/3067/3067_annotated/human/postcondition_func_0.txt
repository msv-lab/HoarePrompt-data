The function accepts a string `S` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and a non-negative integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It counts occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` and for each query defined by indices `(l, r)`, it returns the total number of 'AC' occurrences in the substring `S[l-1:r-1]` (using 0-based indexing). The output for each query is printed sequentially.
