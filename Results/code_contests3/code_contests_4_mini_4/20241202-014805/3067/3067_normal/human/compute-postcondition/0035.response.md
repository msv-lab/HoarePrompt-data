The values of `l` and `r` are assigned based on the input received through `raw_input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variables `N`, `P`, and `Q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `l` and `r`, obtained from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
