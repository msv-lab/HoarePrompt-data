According to the code, the loop iterates `Q` times. Each iteration of the loop does not directly modify the variables `N`, `P`, `l`, or `r`, so their values remain the same for the next iteration. The loop will execute one more time as long as the iteration variable `_` does not exceed `Q - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `P` is a list of length `N + 1`, and `l` and `r` are assigned integer values from input. Since the loop runs for `Q` iterations, it will execute one more time when `_` reaches the value of the next iteration, which is `1` more than the current iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer, `P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `l` and `r` are assigned integer values from input; for the loop to execute a second time, `_` must be less than `Q`.**
