The variable `S` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer representing the length of the string; `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries; `S` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string; `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries; `S` is an input string.**
