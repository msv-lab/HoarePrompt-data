The list `P` is initialized with zeros, and its length is `N + 1`. This means `P` will hold `N + 1` elements, all initialized to `0`. The values of `N`, `Q`, and `S` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer representing the length of the string; `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries; `S` is an input string; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with zeros.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string; `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries; `S` is an input string; `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with zeros.**
