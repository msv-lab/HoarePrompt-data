The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be calculated based on the value of `P[1]`. The previous value of `P[1]` is unknown, but `P[2]` will be `P[1] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `P[0]` is 0, and `P[2]` is `P[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` is an integer greater than 0, `P[0]` is 0, `P[2]` is `P[1] + 1**
