`P[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state mentions that `N` is an integer greater than 0 and `i` is 1, but neither `N` nor `i` is affected by this assignment. Since `P` is being assigned a value at index `0`, it implies that `P` is an array or list that can hold values. Thus, the output state reflects the change in `P` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0**
