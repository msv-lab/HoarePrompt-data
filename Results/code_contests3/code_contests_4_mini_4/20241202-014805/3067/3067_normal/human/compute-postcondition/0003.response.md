According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute `N` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = N - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than 0.

Before the loop starts, `P` is initialized with zeros, which does not affect the execution of the loop, but it is important to note that `P` will be used within the body of the loop. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute for the first time, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `N` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at 0, which is the initial value of `i` in the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with zeros**
