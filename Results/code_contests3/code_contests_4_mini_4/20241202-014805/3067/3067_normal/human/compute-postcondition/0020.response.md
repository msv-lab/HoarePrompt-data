According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
