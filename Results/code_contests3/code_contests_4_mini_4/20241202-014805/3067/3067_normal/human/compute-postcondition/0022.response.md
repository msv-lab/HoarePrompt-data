The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
