`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Since `P` is a list of length `N + 1` initialized with zeros, the value of `P[i - 1]` is 0 (as it is initialized with zeros). Therefore, after execution, `P[i]` will also be 0. The values of `N`, `i`, and `P` are not affected in any other way. The output state is: `N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `P[i]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[i]` is 0**
