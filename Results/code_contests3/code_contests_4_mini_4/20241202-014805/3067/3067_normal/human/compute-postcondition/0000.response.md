The variables `N` and `Q` are assigned the values obtained from the `raw_input()` function, which accepts a string input and splits it into two parts. These parts are then converted to integers. The string `S` and the queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries**.
