The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string consisting only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', with a length `N` such that 2 <= N <= 100000. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `Q`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= Q <= 100000. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` where 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N. 

The function processes these queries and returns results based on the specified range of indices in the string `S`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `S` of specified length and a number of queries `Q`, and to return results for each query based on the characters in the string within the specified index ranges.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer Q representing the number of queries, returning results for each query that specifies a range in the string S.**
