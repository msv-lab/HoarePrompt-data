The code assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be assigned the value of `P[1]`. The initial state indicates that `N` is greater than 0 and does not affect the value of `P[i]` directly. Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[2]` is set to the value of `P[1]`, while `P[0]` remains 0 and the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`P[0]` is 0, `P[2]` is set to the value of `P[1]`**
