The function `func` accepts a string `S` containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q`, which represents the number of queries. It processes the string to count the occurrences of the substring 'AC' and generates a prefix sum array `P` to track the cumulative count of 'AC' substrings. For each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, it calculates and prints the number of 'AC' substrings that exist within the range from index `l` to `r` (inclusive of `l` and exclusive of `r`).

The function does not handle cases where `l` is equal to `r` explicitly, but since the constraints ensure that `l < r`, this edge case is inherently managed. However, there is no check for invalid input values of `l` and `r` beyond the assumption they will always satisfy the constraints. The function assumes the input will always be valid according to the specified ranges.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` and processes `Q` queries to return the number of 'AC' substrings in the specified ranges. **
