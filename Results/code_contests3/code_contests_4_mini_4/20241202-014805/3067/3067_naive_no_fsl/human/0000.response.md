Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the substring indexing correctly according to the problem description. The issue arises with the way the program calculates the occurrences of the substring "AC" in the queries. 

### Issues:
1. The program uses 0-based indexing for the string `S` but the queries are given in 1-based indexing. This leads to potential off-by-one errors in the way the program accesses the string. 
2. The logic for counting occurrences of "AC" relies on `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which assumes that the substring defined by `(l, r)` is inclusive of both `l` and `r`. However, since `l` and `r` are 1-based and the program is working with 0-based indices, this will lead to an incorrect count when `l` is greater than 1.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
N = 5, Q = 1
S = "ACGTA"
l_1 = 1, r_1 = 5
```
According to the problem description, the substring from index 1 to 5 is "ACGTA". The occurrences of "AC" in this substring are 1 (the substring "AC" at the start). However, due to the off-by-one error, the program would incorrectly calculate the occurrences by using:
```
P[4] - P[0] 
```
which may lead to an incorrect count if the occurrences of "AC" involve the boundaries.

Thus, the program does not correctly satisfy the problem requirements for all potential cases.
