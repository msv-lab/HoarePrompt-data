Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. For each query defined by the indices `l` and `r`, it calculates and prints the count of 'AC' substrings in the substring `S[l-1:r-1]`. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly for each query. It also assumes valid input as per the specified constraints. **
