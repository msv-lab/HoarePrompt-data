The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the initial state does not provide any information about being inside a loop, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0, and we are in the current iteration of a loop where `continue` was executed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0, and we are in the current iteration of a loop where `continue` was executed.**
