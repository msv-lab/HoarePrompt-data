The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `P[1]` will be set to the value of `P[0]`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 0**
