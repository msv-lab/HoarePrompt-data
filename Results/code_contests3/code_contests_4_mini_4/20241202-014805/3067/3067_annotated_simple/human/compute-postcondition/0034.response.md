According to the code, the loop will execute for each iteration of `Q`. At the end of the last iteration, we have calculated `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which is a specific operation related to the counts of 'AC' substrings. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that the loop variable (which is an underscore `_` indicating it is unused) will iterate until `Q` is reached.

Since we do not know the total number of iterations `Q`, we can assume that it is greater than the current iteration count. For the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must still be greater than the current iteration count.

If we assume this is the first iteration of the loop, then at the end of this iteration, the next iteration will occur, and the count will need to reflect that. 

Therefore, the next state would be as follows:

State: **`P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is calculated, for the loop to execute a second time `Q` must be greater than 1**
