According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. Since `N` is a positive integer, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
