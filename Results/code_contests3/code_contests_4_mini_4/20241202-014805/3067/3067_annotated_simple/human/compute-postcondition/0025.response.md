`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]`. However, `P[1]` has not been defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine its value; hence, we cannot assign a specific value to `P[2]`. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, and `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]` (undefined)**
