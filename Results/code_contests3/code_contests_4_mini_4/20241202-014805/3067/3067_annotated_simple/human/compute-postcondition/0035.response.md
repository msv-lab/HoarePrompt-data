The values of `l` and `r` are assigned the integers obtained from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous calculation `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` remains unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute a second time, which is `Q > 1`, is also not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values for `l` and `r` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are assigned integer values from input, `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is calculated, and `Q` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
