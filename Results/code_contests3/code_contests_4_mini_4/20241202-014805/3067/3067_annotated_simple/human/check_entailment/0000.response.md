To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program step by step in relation to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
1. We have a string `S` of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
2. We need to respond to `Q` queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, indicating the range of indices in the string.
3. For each query, we need to count how many times the substring "AC" occurs in the substring `S[l_i-1:r_i]` (note that the indices are inclusive and 1-based).

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the values of `N` and `Q`.
   - It reads the string `S`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a list `P` of size `N + 1` to keep a cumulative count of occurrences of the substring "AC".
   - The loop iterates through the string `S`, checking each pair of characters to see if it matches "AC".
   - If it finds "AC" at the current position, it increments the count in `P[i]` based on the previous count `P[i - 1]`.
   - This logic is correct, as it builds a cumulative count of "AC" substrings up to each index.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program retrieves the indices `l` and `r` and computes the number of "AC" occurrences in the substring from `l` to `r`.
   - The calculation `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` gives the correct count of "AC" substrings in the specified range. This is based on the fact that `P[r - 1]` counts occurrences up to `r-1` and `P[l - 1]` counts occurrences up to `l-2`, thus subtracting them gives the count in the range `[l-1, r-2]`, which corresponds to the substring `S[l-1:r]`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. It effectively counts the occurrences of "AC" in the specified ranges defined by the queries and adheres to the constraints given.

Correctness: **True**
