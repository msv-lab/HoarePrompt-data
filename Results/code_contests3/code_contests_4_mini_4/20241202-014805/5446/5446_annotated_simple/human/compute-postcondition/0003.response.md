The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\) and `b` is an integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). 

The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot describe the return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, where a and b are integers each in the range of 1 to 100. The return value is unspecified.**
