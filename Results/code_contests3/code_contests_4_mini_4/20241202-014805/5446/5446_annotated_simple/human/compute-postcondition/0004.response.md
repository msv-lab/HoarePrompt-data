Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `b`, and `c` from user input, where `n` is in the range of 2 to `a + b` (with `a` in the range of 1 to 100 and `b` in the range of 1 to 100). It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, multiplies this ratio by the fraction of `min(b, c)` to `n`, and prints the ceiling of the result as an integer. The function does not return any value. **
