To determine the output state, we must analyze the provided Python code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables.

1. The provided code snippet uses the `min`, `max`, and `ceil` functions, with `b`, `c`, `n`, and `x` being involved in the calculation.
2. The value of `x` is already assigned as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.
3. The `min(b, c)` will yield the smaller of `b` and `c`.
4. The expression `min(b, c) / float(n)` calculates the fraction of the smaller value divided by `n`.
5. This fraction is then multiplied by `x`, which leads to `min(b, c) / float(n) * x`.
6. Finally, the entire expression is passed to `ceil()`, which rounds up to the nearest integer, and the result is cast to an integer with `int()`.

Based on this, we can summarize the outcomes:
- The output will be the integer value of `ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)`, where `x` is defined as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.

However, without specific values for `b`, `c`, and `n`, we cannot calculate a concrete numeric result. Thus, we will describe the output state in terms of the involved variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= `a` + `b`; `a` is an integer such that 1 <= `a` <= 100; `b` is an integer such that 1 <= `b` <= 100; `x` is assigned the value max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)); the output is int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)).**
