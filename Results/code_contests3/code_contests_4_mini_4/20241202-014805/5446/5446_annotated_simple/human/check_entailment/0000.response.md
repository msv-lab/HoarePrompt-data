The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Variables**: The function is set to read three integers from input, but it incorrectly assigns them to `n`, `b`, and `c`. According to the problem description, `n` refers to the number of plates, `a` refers to the number of pieces of the first cake, and `b` refers to the number of pieces of the second cake. The program incorrectly assigns `b` and `c` without properly defining them according to the problem statement.

2. **Logic for x Calculation**: The logic used to compute `x` is flawed. The expression `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not correspond to the requirement of distributing pieces among the plates. Instead, it calculates a ratio between the maximum and minimum pieces of cake, which does not help in determining the maximum possible number of pieces `x` that can be placed on each plate.

3. **Distribution Logic**: The program does not implement a strategy to ensure that each plate has at least one piece of cake and that no plate contains pieces from both cakes. It also does not consider how to maximize the minimum number of pieces on the plates according to the constraints given in the problem description.

4. **Output Calculation**: The final output using `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` does not align with the requirements of the problem. The use of `ceil` and the mathematical operations do not correctly reflect the maximum possible `x` that can be distributed under the given constraints.

In summary, the program fails to correctly read input values, does not implement the necessary logic to compute the maximum possible `x`, and does not take into account the distribution rules specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
