To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic step by step.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Each piece of each cake must be put on some plate.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate may contain pieces from both cakes.
4. We need to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate has at least \( x \) pieces of cake.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, b, c) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]  # Reads n (number of plates), a (pieces of first cake), b (pieces of second cake)
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))  # This calculation seems incorrect in the context
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))  # This outputs a derived result based on the previous line
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. The program uses `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` to determine a value \( x \), which doesn't correspond to the requirement of maximizing the minimum number of pieces per plate. Instead, it seems to calculate a ratio rather than the maximum number of pieces that can be evenly distributed, violating the problem's requirement.
  
2. The program does not handle the scenario where \( n \) exceeds \( a + b \). For valid distribution, \( n \) should be less than or equal to the total number of pieces \( (a + b) \).

3. The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not applicable in Python 3. This would lead to a runtime error if run in a Python 3 environment.

4. The calculation of `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))` does not logically align with how to compute the maximum possible \( x \). It does not guarantee that each plate will have at least \( x \) pieces, as required.

### Example Case for Incorrectness:
- **Input:** `2 1 1` (2 plates, 1 piece of each cake)
  - Expected Output: `1` (Each plate can get 1 piece.)
  - The program would execute the logic incorrectly and likely provide a different output due to flawed calculations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description as it cannot correctly compute the maximum possible number \( x \) for every potential input case. 

Correctness: **False**.
