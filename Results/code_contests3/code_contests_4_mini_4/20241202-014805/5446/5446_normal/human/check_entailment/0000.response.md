To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum possible number `x` such that Ivan can distribute pieces from two cakes (with `a` and `b` pieces respectively) across `n` plates while adhering to the following conditions:
1. Each piece must be placed on a plate.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece.
3. No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program is as follows:
```python
from math import ceil

(n, b, c) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

1. **Input Handling**: It reads three integers `n`, `b`, and `c` from input. Note that the variable names in the code do not match the problem statement (`a` is referred to as `b` and `b` as `c`), but we assume `b` corresponds to the first cake and `c` to the second.

2. **Calculation**:
   - It calculates `x` as the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`.
   - It attempts to compute the maximum pieces per plate by scaling the minimum count (`min(b, c)`) down by `n` and multiplying it by `x`, followed by taking the ceiling of the result.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n` is greater than the total number of pieces (`a + b`), it is impossible to distribute pieces on all plates, which the code does not handle.
- If either `b` or `c` is 0 (invalid since input constraints state `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100`), the code should ideally return an error, but this case is out of the stated constraints.
- The calculation of `x` does not ensure that the distribution respects the requirement of having at least one piece on each plate.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state:
- The function computes a scaled ratio of `max(b, c)` to `min(b, c)`, which is true.
- It mentions that the function lacks error handling for invalid inputs, which is also valid.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description as it does not ensure the correct distribution of pieces among `n` plates in every case. Specifically, the calculation of `x` does not guarantee that the plates will have at least one piece of cake while fulfilling the conditions outlined in the problem statement. 

For example, if `n` is 5 and `b` is 2 and `c` is 3, the code will compute a value that does not represent the maximum pieces per plate accurately as it does not distribute the pieces correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
