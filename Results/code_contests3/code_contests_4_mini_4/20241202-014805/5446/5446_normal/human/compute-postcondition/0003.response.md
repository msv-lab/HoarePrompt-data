The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates based on the constraints provided for the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, where `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100). 

Since there are no specific return conditions provided in the output, we cannot specify any cases for returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the given constraints on the integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function operates with the parameters n, a, and b where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).**
