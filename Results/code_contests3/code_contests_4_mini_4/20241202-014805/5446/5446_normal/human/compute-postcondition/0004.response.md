The function `func` accepts three integers `n`, `b`, and `c` as input. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then scales this ratio by the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n`. Finally, it prints the ceiling of this value. However, there are some points to note: 

1. The function does not explicitly return any value; it only prints the result.
2. The expected range for `n` is from 2 to `a + b`, but `a` is not provided as a parameter in the function call, which may lead to confusion regarding the input constraints.
3. The function does not handle cases where `b` or `c` might be zero or negative, which could lead to incorrect calculations or runtime errors.

Overall, the functionality of the function is to read three integers from input, compute a scaled ratio based on the maximum and minimum of two of those integers, and print the result. It does not return a value and lacks error handling for potential input issues.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `b`, and `c`, computes a scaled ratio of the maximum to minimum of `b` and `c`, and prints the ceiling of the result. It does not return any value and lacks error handling for invalid inputs. **
