The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `a`, and `b` are defined elsewhere, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100), and `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100). 

Since the function doesn't return any specific output in the provided context, we cannot describe the return values. Therefore, based on the information given, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates based on the constraints that n is an integer (2 <= n <= a + b) where a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes. No specific return value is described.**
