To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `b` is a positive integer that represents the number of pieces of the second cake, constrained between 1 and 100.
2. The variable `c` is assigned the value of the third integer input.

The code executes the following operation:
```
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
```

- The `max(b, c)` function returns the maximum value between `b` and `c`.
- The `min(b, c)` function returns the minimum value between `b` and `c`.
- The division then takes place, where the result of `max(b, c)` is divided by the floating-point conversion of `min(b, c)`.

Since `b` is within the range of 1 to 100 and `c` is an input integer, both `b` and `c` can take on various values, but they won't affect the assignment of `x` in terms of variable states.

The output will reflect that `x` is assigned the calculated value based on `b` and `c`, while the states of `n` and other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= `a + b`; `b` is a positive integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100); `c` is assigned the value of the third integer input; `x` is assigned max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)).**
