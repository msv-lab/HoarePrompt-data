The function processes user input to obtain three integers: `n`, `b`, and `c`. It computes the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then calculates the ceiling of the product of the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n` multiplied by this ratio. The result is printed as an integer. However, the function lacks direct return values and does not handle cases where `n` is greater than the sum of `a` and `b`, or where `b` and `c` are both zero, which could lead to division issues.
