Correctness: **False**.

The provided program has issues in the way it calculates the Pythagorean triples based on the input `n`. Specifically, for even values of `n`, the calculation for `m` and `k` is incorrect due to integer division in Python 2, which the program appears to be written in. 

For instance, if we take `n = 6` as an example:
- The expected output is `8 10`, which corresponds to the triple `(6, 8, 10)`.
- The program calculates `m` and `k` as follows:
  - `m = n * n / 4 - 1` which evaluates to `6 * 6 / 4 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`
  - `k = n * n / 4 + 1` which evaluates to `6 * 6 / 4 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`

While this works correctly for `n = 6`, the logic for odd `n` is flawed. For `n = 3`, the program calculates:
- `m = (3 * 3 - 1) / 2 = (9 - 1) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4`
- `k = (3 * 3 + 1) / 2 = (9 + 1) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`

This works, but for `n = 1`, the program returns `-1`, which is correct. However, for `n = 5`, which is another odd number, the program would return:
- `m = (5 * 5 - 1) / 2 = 12`
- `k = (5 * 5 + 1) / 2 = 13`

While this output is correct, the program does not handle the case for `n = 2`. According to the description, `n` can be any integer from 1 to 109, and the program should ideally return a Pythagorean triple or `-1` for any non-suitable value. 

Additionally, the use of `print` with parentheses in the tuple `(print(...), ...)` is incorrect because it tries to create a tuple with the print output which is not the intended behavior.

Therefore, the program does not consistently provide valid outputs for all cases defined by the problem description. 

Thus, the final assessment is that the program is incorrect due to its potential inability to handle all inputs correctly, specifically the logic for even `n` and malformed output for the print statements.

Correctness: **False**.
