To evaluate the given code snippet, we first need to analyze the expressions within the print statement.

1. The variable `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2. This means `n` can take on values like 3, 5, 7, etc.
2. The expressions in the print statement involve calculations using `n`:
   - The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2`. This can be simplified as:
     - `n * n` is the square of `n`.
     - Subtracting 1 gives us one less than the square of `n`.
     - Dividing this result by 2 gives us half of that value.
   - The second expression is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. This can be simplified as:
     - `n * n` is again the square of `n`.
     - Adding 1 gives us one more than the square of `n`.
     - Dividing this result by 2 gives us half of that value.

Given that `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, both expressions will yield specific numeric results based on the value of `n`.

For example:
- If `n = 3`, then:
  - First expression: `(3 * 3 - 1) / 2 = (9 - 1) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4`
  - Second expression: `(3 * 3 + 1) / 2 = (9 + 1) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5`
  
- If `n = 5`, then:
  - First expression: `(5 * 5 - 1) / 2 = (25 - 1) / 2 = 24 / 2 = 12`
  - Second expression: `(5 * 5 + 1) / 2 = (25 + 1) / 2 = 26 / 2 = 13`

Since `n` can take on multiple values, the output will depend on the specific odd integer greater than 2 chosen for `n`. However, we should express the output state in terms of `n` without specifying a singular value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2; the outputs are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`**.
