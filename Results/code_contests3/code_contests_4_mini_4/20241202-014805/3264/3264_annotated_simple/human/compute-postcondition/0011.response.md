Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` via user input (with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints `-1`. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints the values `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`. The function does not return any value, and it relies on print statements for output instead.**
