Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, there is a syntax error in the print statement. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, the outputs are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, the outputs are `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`.***
