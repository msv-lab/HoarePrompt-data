The code snippet attempts to print `- 1`, but there is a syntax error in the print statement. Since it does not affect any variables and no valid output can be generated, the output state reflects that the statement could not be executed properly. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is less than or equal to 2; syntax error in print statement**
