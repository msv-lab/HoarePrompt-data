The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input as a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state will reflect that `n` is now set to the input integer provided by the user. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer as input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer as input**
