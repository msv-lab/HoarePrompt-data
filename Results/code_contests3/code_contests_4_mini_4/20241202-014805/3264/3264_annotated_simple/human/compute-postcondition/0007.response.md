The code consists of a `print` statement that outputs two calculations based on the value of `n`. 

First, we calculate `n * n / 4 - 1`. Given that `n` is an even positive integer greater than 2, `n * n` is also even, and dividing it by 4 results in another integer. Subtracting 1 from this value yields an integer.

Next, we calculate `n * n / 4 + 1`. Similarly, this also results in an integer, as we are adding 1 to the earlier calculated integer.

Since the output is from a `print` statement, it does not affect the values of `n` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the results of both calculations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and even; output is (n * n / 4 - 1), (n * n / 4 + 1)**
