You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Katya studies in a fifth grade. Recently her class studied right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. It appeared, that there are triples of positive integers such that you can construct a right triangle with segments of lengths corresponding to triple. Such triples are called Pythagorean triples.

For example, triples (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13) and (6, 8, 10) are Pythagorean triples.

Here Katya wondered if she can specify the length of some side of right triangle and find any Pythagorean triple corresponding to such length? Note that the side which length is specified can be a cathetus as well as hypotenuse.

Katya had no problems with completing this task. Will you do the same?

Input

The only line of the input contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109) — the length of some side of a right triangle.

Output

Print two integers m and k (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1018), such that n, m and k form a Pythagorean triple, in the only line.

In case if there is no any Pythagorean triple containing integer n, print  - 1 in the only line. If there are many answers, print any of them.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(raw_input())
    if (n <= 2) :
        print - 1
    else :
        if (n & 1) :
            print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2
        else :
            print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 2. If `n` is odd, the outputs are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, the outputs are `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, there is a syntax error in the print statement. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, the outputs are `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, the outputs are `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
