Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Input Values:** The program outputs `-1` for any input value `n` that is less than or equal to 2, which is correct. However, the program fails to account for the edge case where `n = 1`. The problem description specifies that if there is no Pythagorean triple containing integer `n`, the output should be `-1`. While `n = 1` correctly should return `-1`, the implementation does not address the cases for `n = 2`, which also cannot form a Pythagorean triple.

2. **Output Types:** The program uses integer division (`/`) in Python 2, which might lead to float outputs in other contexts. The problem states that the output should consist of two integers. The use of `print(n * n - 1) / 2` will not ensure that the output is in integer form due to the division operator precedence.

3. **Pythagorean Triple Calculation:** The formulas used for calculating the values of `m` and `k` when `n` is odd or even are not guaranteed to produce valid integers within the specified bounds of `1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18`. For example, the calculations for even `n` involve divisions that could lead to non-integer values, and thus fail the requirement of producing integers.

4. **Generalization:** The problem description states that there should be outputs for any positive integer `n` that can form a Pythagorean triple. The current implementation incorrectly assumes specific formulas based on whether `n` is odd or even, but it does not cover all cases appropriately, particularly concerning the ranges and types of outputs.

Overall, the implementation does not comply with the problem requirements as it can produce incorrect outputs or types, and it restricts valid inputs incorrectly. Thus, it does not meet the criteria set by the problem description.
