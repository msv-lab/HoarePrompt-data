The given Python program aims to determine whether a given integer \( n \) can form a Pythagorean triple by calculating two other integers \( m \) and \( k \) based on the value of \( n \). 

Now, let's analyze the code and the problem description:

1. The program first checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it prints `-1`. This is consistent with the problem description, as there are no valid Pythagorean triples involving lengths less than or equal to 2.

2. If \( n \) is greater than 2:
   - If \( n \) is odd, it calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - If \( n \) is even, it calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)

The output hints indicate that the program behaves as expected for odd and even \( n \), producing valid values for \( m \) and \( k \) to form a Pythagorean triple.

However, there are potential edge cases that need to be considered:
- For odd \( n \), the calculations for \( m \) and \( k \) must yield positive integers. Given that \( n \) is odd and \( n > 2 \), both derived values will be positive. Therefore, this part is handled correctly.
- For even \( n \), we need to ensure that \( \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \) and \( \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \) are both positive integers. This will always be true for \( n \geq 4 \). However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where \( n = 2 \) (it outputs `-1`), which is still valid since \( n = 2 \) cannot form a Pythagorean triple.

Now, we must check if the output hints agree with the code:
- The output hints correctly summarize the functionality of the program, breaking down how it calculates \( m \) and \( k \) based on whether \( n \) is odd or even.
- The hints also align with the examples provided in the problem description.

After reviewing the code's logic and the output hints, it appears that the code correctly implements the intended functionality for all specified inputs according to the problem description.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly identifies whether a given integer \( n \) can be part of a Pythagorean triple and calculates the corresponding \( m \) and \( k \) values based on the parity of \( n \). Edge cases are handled appropriately, and the output hints confirm that the implementation aligns with the problem requirements.
