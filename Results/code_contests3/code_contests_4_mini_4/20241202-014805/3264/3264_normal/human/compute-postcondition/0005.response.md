To calculate the output, we first evaluate the expressions based on the initial state. 

1. The expression `n * n - 1` calculates the square of `n` and subtracts 1.
2. The expression `(n * n + 1)` calculates the square of `n` and adds 1.
3. Both results are divided by 2.

Given that `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, we can express the results as follows:
- Let `n` be an odd integer, e.g., 3, 5, 7, etc.
- The value of `n * n` will always be odd since the square of an odd number is odd.
- Therefore, `n * n - 1` will be even, and dividing it by 2 will yield an integer.
- Similarly, `n * n + 1` will be even, and dividing it by 2 will also yield an integer.

Thus, the computed values will be integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, and `n` is an odd integer; results are (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2.**
