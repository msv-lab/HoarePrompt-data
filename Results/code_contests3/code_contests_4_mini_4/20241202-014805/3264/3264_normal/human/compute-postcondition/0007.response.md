The code calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

Given that `n` is a positive even integer larger than 2, we can find the values of these expressions. The first expression will yield a value that is one less than a quarter of `n` squared, and the second expression will yield a value that is one more than that same quarter.

The calculations for the two expressions will not change the value of `n`, but they produce two output values based on the computation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, and `n` is an even integer; outputs are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
