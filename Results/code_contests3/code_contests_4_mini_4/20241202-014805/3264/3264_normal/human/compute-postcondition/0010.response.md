The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate with a positive integer `n` that is implicitly defined within the function, constrained by the condition that it falls within the range of 1 to 10^9. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot detail what it returns. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently unclear without additional information on its return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with a positive integer n within the range of 1 to 10^9, but the return value is unspecified.**
