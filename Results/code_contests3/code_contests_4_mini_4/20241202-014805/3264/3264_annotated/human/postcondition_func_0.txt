The function accepts a positive integer input `n` from the user. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it calculates and prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it calculates and prints two different values: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. There is no explicit return value from the function, as it only prints output to the console.
