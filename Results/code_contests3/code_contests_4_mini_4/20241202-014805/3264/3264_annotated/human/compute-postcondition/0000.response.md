The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, its value will now be set to the input provided. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input**
