The code calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`, which is a positive even integer greater than 2. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

Let's denote `m = n * n / 4`. Since `n` is an even integer, `m` will also be an integer. Therefore, the two expressions can be simplified as follows:

1. The first expression results in `m - 1`.
2. The second expression results in `m + 1`.

The values of `m - 1` and `m + 1` are calculated based on the input value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and an even integer; the output values are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
