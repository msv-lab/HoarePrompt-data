Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Output Format**: The problem description states that the function should print two integers \( m \) and \( k \) that form a Pythagorean triple with the given integer \( n \). However, the program uses integer division (the `/` operator) instead of the floor division (`//`) in Python 2, which can lead to unexpected results. This can cause incorrect outputs when \( n \) is even.

2. **Handling of \( n = 1 \)**: The program correctly prints -1 when \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. However, the problem description states that \( n \) can be any positive integer, and for \( n = 1 \), it should output -1. The program does this, which is correct, but it should explicitly handle the case of \( n = 1 \) in a way that keeps consistency with the problem description.

3. **Range and Validity of Outputs**: The outputs for odd \( n \) are calculated as:
   - \( m = (n^2 - 1) / 2 \)
   - \( k = (n^2 + 1) / 2 \)
   The outputs for even \( n \) are calculated as:
   - \( m = n^2 / 4 - 1 \)
   - \( k = n^2 / 4 + 1 \)

   This can lead to cases where the outputs are not valid positive integers or not satisfying the condition for forming a Pythagorean triple, particularly if \( n \) is odd. For example, if \( n = 3 \), the computation yields:
   - \( m = (3^2 - 1) / 2 = 4 \)
   - \( k = (3^2 + 1) / 2 = 5 \)
   which is correct; however, if you consider larger odd numbers, it does not guarantee that \( m \) and \( k \) will produce a valid Pythagorean triple.

4. **Generalization**: The program does not guarantee that it will output a Pythagorean triple for any valid input \( n \) as long as \( n > 2 \). For instance, while it may work for many odd and even integers, there is no systematic proof or check that the computed \( m \) and \( k \) will always lead to a valid right triangle.

In conclusion, while the program attempts to address the problem, it contains flaws in output generation and does not ensure valid Pythagorean triples for all inputs, leading to the conclusion that it does not fully meet the problem description.
