Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains logical errors in its implementation of the conditions for generating Pythagorean triples.

1. For odd `n`, the program attempts to calculate `m` and `k` using the formulas:
   - `m = (n * n - 1) / 2`
   - `k = (n * n + 1) / 2`
   However, the division by 2 is performed using `/`, which in Python 2 produces a float result instead of an integer. This can lead to incorrect outputs, particularly when `n` is odd.

2. For even `n`, the program calculates `m` and `k` as:
   - `m = (n * n / 4 - 1)`
   - `k = (n * n / 4 + 1)`
   Similar to the above, the division here could also yield a float, leading to potential issues with integer results.

3. The program fails to handle cases where `n` is a Pythagorean triple side correctly. Specifically, there are values of `n` (like `1`, `2`, `4`, etc.) that are not part of any Pythagorean triple, which should return `-1`, but the logic in the program does not cover these cases correctly.

For example:
- If `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` as expected.
- If `n = 2`, the program does not output `-1`, but rather it incorrectly attempts to produce a result.

Therefore, due to these issues, the program does not guarantee correct outputs for all valid inputs, which leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
