Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the first line (which is supposed to be the integer `n` representing the length of the text) using `raw_input()`, but it does not utilize this value in any part of the computation. The problem description states that the first line contains an integer, but this integer is ignored, meaning the program does not adhere to the input format specified.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the case of empty input properly. Although the problem description states that `n` is at least 1, if there were any deviation in input (like a missing second line), the program would not function correctly. Additionally, there is no explicit validation to check whether the length of the string matches the provided integer `n`.

3. **Output Specification**: While the program correctly calculates the maximum volume of capital letters, it lacks proper validation of input data and does not handle edge cases such as when no words are provided, or if the words are formatted incorrectly.

Therefore, due to the aforementioned reasons, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly in all potential cases.
