According to the code, the loop iterates over `i`, which is the second word in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be an iterable. Given that `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` will correctly reference the second word in `l`.

However, since the loop is iterating over `i`, it is essential to note that `i` must be of a type that can be iterated over (like a string, list, etc.). If `i` is indeed a string (since it is a word), the loop will execute over the characters of that string.

The states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (does not need adjustment for the loop execution).
- `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0 (does not need adjustment for the loop execution).
- `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words (does not need adjustment for the loop execution).
- `i` is the second word in `l`, which must be a string for the loop to iterate over its characters.
- `s` is 0 (does not need adjustment for the loop execution).

Thus, the only necessary states to confirm for the loop to execute are that `i` is a string derived from the second word in a list of at least 2 words.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in `l` (which must be a string), `s` is 0**
