The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in `l`, which is a string and contains at least 1 character, `s` is now 1, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
