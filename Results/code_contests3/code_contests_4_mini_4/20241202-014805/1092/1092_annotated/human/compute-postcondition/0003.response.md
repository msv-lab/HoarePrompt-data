According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must contain at least one word. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive) and does not directly impact the loop execution, we only need to focus on `l`. The variable `i` will take the value of the first word in the list during the first iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list `l` must be non-empty (i.e., it should contain at least one word), and `i` will be the first element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in `l`**
