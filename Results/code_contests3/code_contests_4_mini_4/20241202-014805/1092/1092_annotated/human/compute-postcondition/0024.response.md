The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially determined by whether `j` is an uppercase character, its previous value could be either 0 or 1. After this line of code executes, `s` will be either 1 (if it was initially 0) or 2 (if it was initially 1). The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `s` based on its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in `l`, `s` is either 1 or 2.**
