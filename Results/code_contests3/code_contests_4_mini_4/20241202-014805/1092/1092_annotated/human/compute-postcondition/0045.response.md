After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `m` will contain the maximum count of uppercase characters found across all the words in the list `l`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified during the loop. The list `l` will still contain the same words as initially provided. If the list is empty, `m` will remain 0 since the loop will not execute.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase characters in any word in `l`, `l` is a list of words.**
