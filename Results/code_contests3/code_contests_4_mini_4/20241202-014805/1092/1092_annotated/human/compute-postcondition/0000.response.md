The code `raw_input()` reads a line of input from the user, but it does not affect the previous state of any variables. The variable `n` remains unchanged and continues to hold an integer value between 1 and 200 (inclusive). The string of single-space separated words is also not assigned to any variable in this snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change in the existing variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), and the string of single-space separated words is not assigned to any variable.**
