`m` is assigned the value of the maximum between `s` and `m`. The value of `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, and `m` is initially the maximum of `s` and 0. Thus, after execution, `m` will hold the greater value between the counts of uppercase characters in `i` and the previous value of `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200; `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words; `i` is the second word in `l`, which is a string; `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.**
