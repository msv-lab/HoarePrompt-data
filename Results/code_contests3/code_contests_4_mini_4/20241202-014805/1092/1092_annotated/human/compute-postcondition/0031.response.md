According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has at least 3 words, the loop can execute again for the third word. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 words, and `i` should become the third word in the list.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200; `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in `l`, which is a string; `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.**
