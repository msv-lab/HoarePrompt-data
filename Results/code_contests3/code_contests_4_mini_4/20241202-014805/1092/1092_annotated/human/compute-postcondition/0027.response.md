The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially determined by whether `j` was an uppercase character (1 if it was, otherwise 0), the new value of `s` will be either 2 (if `j` was uppercase) or 1 (if `j` was lowercase). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in `l`, and `s` is either 2 or 1.
