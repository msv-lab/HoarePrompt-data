According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. The loop can execute again as long as there are more characters in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, which contains at least 3 words, and `i` is a string containing at least 1 character.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to note the following:
- The loop iterates over each character in `i`, so we need to track the current position in the string `i`.
- If `j` is the current character of `i`, and if it is the last character, then the loop cannot execute again.
- If `i` has more characters, the next character will be processed.

Letâ€™s denote the length of `i` as `len(i)`. Given that `i` contains at least 1 character, if the loop has executed for the current character `j`, the next character will be at position `1` (if `i` had 2 characters), `2` (if `i` had 3 characters), and so on.

To summarize, if `i` has `len(i)` characters, then `j` will take the next character in the next iteration, which will be at index `j+1` where `j` is the index of the character currently processed.

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `j` is now the next character in the string `i`, and for the loop to execute at least one more time, `i` must have at least `len(i) - 1` characters remaining.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in `l`, which is a string and contains at least 1 character, for the loop to execute a fourth time `i` must contain at least 4 characters.**
