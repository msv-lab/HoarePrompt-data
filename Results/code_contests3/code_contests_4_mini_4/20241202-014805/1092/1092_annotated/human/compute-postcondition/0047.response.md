The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), and a string that consists of single-space separated words made up of small and capital Latin letters. After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on them. However, the specific output is not provided in the task description. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a string of words, and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` between 1 and 200 (inclusive) and a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
