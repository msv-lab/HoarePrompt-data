The variable `s` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value after the increment. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in `l`, and `s` is incremented by 1.
