The variable `l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string of space-separated words, splits it into a list of words, and assigns that list to `l`. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `l`, which is a list of words derived from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of words obtained from the input string.**
