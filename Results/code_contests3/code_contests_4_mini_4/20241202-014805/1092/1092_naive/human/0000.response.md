Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the volume of the text according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine the maximum volume of all words is flawed. The maximum variable `m` is updated incorrectly. The line `m = max(s, m)` should instead compare `m` with the count of capital letters for each word being processed, not just the last one counted. 

For example, if the input is:
```
10
A B C D E
```
The expected output should be `1` since each word has a volume of `1`. However, due to the incorrect logic, the program would return `1` as it processes each word correctly, but it does not account for any words that could have a greater volume if they were present.

Additionally, if there are words with multiple capital letters, the program would not yield the correct maximum across multiple words.

Thus, the program is not guaranteed to handle cases correctly where words have varying capital letter counts.
