`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` (the total count of uppercase letters in the third word `i`) and `m` (the maximum number of uppercase letters previously stored). The previous values of `s` and `m` determine the new value of `m`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is either `s` or the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in `i`.
