Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list and is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `j` is the second character of `i`. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
