The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the previous value of `s`, which was the count of uppercase letters in the word `i`, is now reset to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is 0**
