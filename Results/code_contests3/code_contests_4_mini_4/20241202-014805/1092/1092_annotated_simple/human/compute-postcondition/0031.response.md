According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 3 words, the loop will execute one more time for the third word in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be updated to the third word in the list, and `l` must have at least 3 words. 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
