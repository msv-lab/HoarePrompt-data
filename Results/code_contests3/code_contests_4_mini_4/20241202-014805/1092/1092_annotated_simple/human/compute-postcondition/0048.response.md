The function `func` accepts an implicit integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string of single-space separated words with a total length of `n` characters. It reads a line of input but does not utilize the value of `n` directly in the function's logic. Instead, it processes a second line of input, which is split into individual words. The function counts the number of uppercase letters in each word and tracks the maximum count found across all words. Finally, it prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any of the words. 

However, the function does not return any value, as it only prints the result. There are no checks for the length of the input string versus `n`, and it does not handle any potential errors in input format. Thus, while it is expected to handle words of total length `n`, it does not enforce this constraint.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of single-space separated words, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any of the words. It does not return any value and does not enforce the input length constraint based on `n`. **
