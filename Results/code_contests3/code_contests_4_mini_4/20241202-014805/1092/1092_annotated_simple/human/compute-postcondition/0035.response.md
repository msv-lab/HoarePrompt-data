The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially 0, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list (which is a non-empty string), `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase letter.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list (which is a non-empty string), `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase letter.**
