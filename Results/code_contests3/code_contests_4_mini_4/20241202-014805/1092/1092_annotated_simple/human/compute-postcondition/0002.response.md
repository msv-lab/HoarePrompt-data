`m` is assigned the value `0`, and this assignment does not affect the previous values of `n` or `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words from the input, `m` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words from the input, `m` is 0**
