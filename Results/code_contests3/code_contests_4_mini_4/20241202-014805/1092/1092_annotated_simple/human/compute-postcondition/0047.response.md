The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters since it's defined without any. However, it operates on two implicit inputs: an integer `n` which is constrained to be between 1 and 200, and a string of single-space separated words. This string consists only of small and capital Latin letters and has a total length of `n` characters. 

As for the output, while the specific behavior is not defined in the provided information, the function's purpose likely involves processing the string of words based on the length `n`. 

Given these details, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string of single-space separated words of total length n. It processes the string based on the value of n.**
