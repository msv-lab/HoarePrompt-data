The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. This directly affects the value of `s`, but it does not change the values of the other variables. The previous value of `s` is not relevant as it is being reset to `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is the maximum of 0 and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is now 0**.
