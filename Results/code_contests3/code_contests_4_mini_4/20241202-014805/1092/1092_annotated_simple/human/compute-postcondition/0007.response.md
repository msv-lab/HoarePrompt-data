The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Consequently, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, and `j` is a character from the word `i` that is uppercase.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 1, and `j` is a character from the word `i` that is uppercase.**
