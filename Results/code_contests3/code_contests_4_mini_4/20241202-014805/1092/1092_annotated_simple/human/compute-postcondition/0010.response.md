The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `s` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `j` was the next character in the word `i` and an uppercase character. After execution, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is either 1 or 2**
