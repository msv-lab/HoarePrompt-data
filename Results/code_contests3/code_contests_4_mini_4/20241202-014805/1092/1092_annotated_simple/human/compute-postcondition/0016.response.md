The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. Given that `m` is initially 0, the value of `m` will be updated to the value of `s` if `s` is greater than 0. The current value of `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the word `i**.
