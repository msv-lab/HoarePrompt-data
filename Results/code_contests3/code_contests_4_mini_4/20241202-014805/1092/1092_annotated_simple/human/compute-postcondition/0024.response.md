The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the first character `j` of `i` is an uppercase letter or not. After execution, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list and is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `s` is either 1 or 2**.
