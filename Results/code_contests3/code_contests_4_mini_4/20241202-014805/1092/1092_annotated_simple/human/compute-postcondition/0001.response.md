The variable `l` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which reads a string of single-space separated words from input and splits it into a list of words. The variable `n` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `l` is a list of words from the input**
