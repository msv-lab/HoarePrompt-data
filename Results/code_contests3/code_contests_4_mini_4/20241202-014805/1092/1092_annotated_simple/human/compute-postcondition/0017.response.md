According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If the list has more words after the current word, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and the list contains at least 1 word. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be updated to the next word in the list `l`, and since `l` has at least 1 word, it should have at least 2 words in total for the loop to continue. 

Thus, to execute one more time, `i` must be the second word in the list, and the list must contain at least 2 words.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in the word `i`**
