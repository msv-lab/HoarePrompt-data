The value of `s` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0**
