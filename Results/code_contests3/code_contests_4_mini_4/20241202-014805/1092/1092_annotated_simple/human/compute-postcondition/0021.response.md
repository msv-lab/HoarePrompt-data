The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list and is a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
