Correctness: **False**

The program fails in the following potential case:

If the input text consists of multiple words with varying volumes, it may not correctly identify the word with the maximum volume. For instance, consider the input:

```
25
HeLLo WoRLD tHiS iS a TeSt
```

The expected output should be `3`, as the word "WoRLD" has 3 capital letters, which is the maximum among all words. However, the program incorrectly computes the maximum volume by resetting `s` for every word, which leads to the wrong maximum being stored in `m`.

The program logic does not ensure that it correctly identifies the maximum volume across all words because it initializes `s` for each word, rather than keeping track of the maximum correctly. As a result, it does not adhere to the problem description in all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
