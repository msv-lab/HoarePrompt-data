The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `s` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list and has at least 2 characters, `s` is 2, and `j` is the second character of `i`.**
