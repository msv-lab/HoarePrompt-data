According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is the first character of that word. For the loop to execute again, `j` must take on the next character in the string `i`.

Since `i` is the first word in the list, the length of `i` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. If `i` has more characters, the next character will be assigned to `j`. Therefore, after this iteration, `j` will be the second character of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and `s` is 1 if `j`, the second character of `i`, is an uppercase letter. If `j` is not uppercase, the value of `s` remains 0.**
