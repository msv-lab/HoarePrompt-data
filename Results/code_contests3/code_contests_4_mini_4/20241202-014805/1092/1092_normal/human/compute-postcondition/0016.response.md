The value of `m` is assigned the maximum of `s` and `m`. Since `m` is initially 0 and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the word `i`, the new value of `m` will be either `s` (if it is greater than 0) or will remain 0 if `s` is also 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the word `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the word `i`.**
