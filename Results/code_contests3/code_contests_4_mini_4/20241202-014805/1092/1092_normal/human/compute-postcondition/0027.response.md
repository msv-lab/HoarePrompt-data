The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is unknown since `m` can either be `s` or 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list and has at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character of `i`, and `s` is increased by 1.
