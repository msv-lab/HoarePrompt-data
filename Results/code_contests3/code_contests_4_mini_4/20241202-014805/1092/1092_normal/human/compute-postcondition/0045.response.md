To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we analyze the loop structure and the given initial state.

The loop iterates over each word in the list `l`. For each word `i`, it counts the number of uppercase letters (stored in `s`), and then updates `m` to be the maximum value between `s` and the previous value of `m`.

After all iterations are complete, the following conditions hold:

1. `n` remains unchanged, still between 1 and 200.
2. `m` will be the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any of the words in the list `l`.
3. `l` retains its original list of words.
4. The variable `i` will not have a value after the loop since it only exists within the loop's scope.
5. The variable `s` will not have a value after the loop since it is reinitialized to 0 in each iteration.

Given this understanding, we can conclude the final state of the variables:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters in any word of `l`, `l` is a list of words, `i` is not defined, `s` is not defined.**
