In the given code snippet, `s` is assigned the value of 0. The previous value of `s` is not specified, but since it's being reset to 0, it indicates that any previous count of uppercase letters in the word `i` is discarded. The other variables `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this reset and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 0**
