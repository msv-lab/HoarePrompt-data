According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the characters in `i`. Since `i` is the second word in the list and has at least 2 characters, it has at least 2 iterations possible.

At the end of the last iteration, we have the state where `i` is the second word in the list of words, and its second character `j` was processed. Since `j` is one of the characters of `i`, if `i` has at least 2 characters, the loop will execute again for the next character. 

If `j` is the first character of `i`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` should be the second character of `i` in the next iteration. Therefore, if `i` has at least 3 characters, we can expect that the loop will execute again for the next character in `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list and has at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character of `i`**
