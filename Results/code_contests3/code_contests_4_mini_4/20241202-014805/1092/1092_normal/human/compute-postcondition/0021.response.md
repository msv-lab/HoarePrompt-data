The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is initially 0, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
