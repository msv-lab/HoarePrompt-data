According to the code, the for loop iterates over the variable `i`, which is defined as the third word in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `i` must contain at least one character, as it is being iterated over. Given the state before the loop starts, `i` is already the third word in `l`, and since `l` is stated to have at least 3 words, `i` will exist and should contain at least one character.

The variable `j`, which is the last character of `i`, is also stated to depend on `i`. If `i` has at least one character, `j` will be defined. 

Thus, the conditions for the loop to execute are met with the existing states. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is 0, `j` is the last character of `i` (assuming `i` has at least one character)**.
