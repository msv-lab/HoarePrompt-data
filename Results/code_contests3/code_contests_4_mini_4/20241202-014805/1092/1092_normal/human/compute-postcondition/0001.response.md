`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which reads a string of single-space separated words and splits it into a list of words. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, after execution, `l` contains the list of words derived from the input string. The output state indicates the unchanged value of `n` and the new list `l`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of words from the input string**
