The value of `m` is assigned the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`. The previous value of `m` is unknown (as it is defined as the maximum of `s` and `m`), while `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`. The values of the other variables `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200; `m` is updated to the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`; `j` is the last character of `i`.
