The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is 1, `j` is the last character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
