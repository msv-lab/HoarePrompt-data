The value of `s` is assigned 0, which directly affects the variable `s`. The other variables, `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged since they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is 0, and `j` is the last character of `i` if it has at least one character.
