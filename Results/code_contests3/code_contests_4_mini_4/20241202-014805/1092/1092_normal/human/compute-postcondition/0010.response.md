The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` could be either 0 or 1 depending on whether the second character `j` of the first word `i` is uppercase or not. Therefore, after execution, `s` could be 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200; `m` is 0; `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word; `i` is the first word in the list; `s` is either 1 or 2.**
