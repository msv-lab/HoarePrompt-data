The variable `m` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged as it is an integer between 1 and 200, and `l` remains as a list of words from the input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of words from the input string; `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of words from the input string; `m` is 0**
