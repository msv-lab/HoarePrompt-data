To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the details.

**Problem description:** The program is expected to output a single integer based on a non-negative integer input `a` (0 ≤ a ≤ 15) which is used as an index to access a predefined list.

**Provided Program:**
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program takes an integer input `a`, which should be between 0 and 15.
2. It uses this integer to index into a predefined list of integers.
3. The list is defined as `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which contains 16 elements.

### Edge Cases:
- If the input `a` is less than 0 or greater than 15, the program will raise an `IndexError` since Python will attempt to access an index that does not exist in the list.
- The program does not handle invalid inputs (i.e., inputs outside the specified range) and does not include any exception handling.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints indicate that the function prints an element from the list based on the user input and specifies the range of valid input values (0 to 15). It correctly identifies that if the input is outside this range, an `IndexError` will occur, which is consistent with the behavior of the program.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not fulfill the requirement to handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle inputs that are out of the defined range (0 to 15), which will lead to an error instead of a valid output or an error message.
- Therefore, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (particularly regarding input validation), we conclude that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will raise an `IndexError` if the input is less than 0 or greater than 15, which is not handled, thus making it incorrect.
