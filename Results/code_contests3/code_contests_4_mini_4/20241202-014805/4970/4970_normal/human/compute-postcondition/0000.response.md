To determine the output state, we note that the code snippet contains a print statement which prints an element from a list based on an integer input. The input is taken from `raw_input()`, which will accept a string and then convert it to an integer using `int()`. The integer input corresponds to an index of the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

The variable `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq 15\), indicating that the input provided will determine which element of the list is printed:

- If the input is `0`, it will print `15`.
- If the input is `1`, it will print `14`.
- If the input is `2`, it will print `12`.
- If the input is `3`, it will print `13`.
- If the input is `4`, it will print `8`.
- If the input is `5`, it will print `9`.
- If the input is `6`, it will print `10`.
- If the input is `7`, it will print `11`.
- If the input is `8`, it will print `0`.
- If the input is `9`, it will print `1`.
- If the input is `10`, it will print `2`.
- If the input is `11`, it will print `3`.
- If the input is `12`, it will print `4`.
- If the input is `13`, it will print `5`.
- If the input is `14`, it will print `6`.
- If the input is `15`, it will print `7`.

Since the specific value of `a` (the input integer) was not provided, we can assume it can take any value from `0` to `15`. The output is based on the index of the list accessed by this input.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15; printed value is based on the index from the list.**
