The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work within the constraints that a is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15. However, since there are no parameters provided to the function, we cannot specify a return value related to the parameter `a` directly based on the function's signature. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is not clearly defined without additional context about how `a` is utilized or determined within the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its functionality cannot be determined without additional context regarding the use of a non-negative integer 'a'.**
