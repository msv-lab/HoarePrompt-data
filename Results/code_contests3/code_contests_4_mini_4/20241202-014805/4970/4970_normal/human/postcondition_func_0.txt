The function accepts no parameters and prints an element from a predefined list based on user input. The input should be a non-negative integer between 0 and 15 inclusive, which is used as an index to access the list. If the input is outside this range, it will raise an `IndexError`. The function does not handle any exceptions or invalid inputs.
