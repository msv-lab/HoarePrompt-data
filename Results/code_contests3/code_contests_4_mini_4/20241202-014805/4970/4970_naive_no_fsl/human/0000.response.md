Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to output a specific integer based on the input integer `a`, which ranges from 0 to 15. However, the mapping of inputs to outputs is done using a hard-coded list, and it seems to only handle the values from 0 to 15. 

The list provided in the program is:
```python
[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

This list has exactly 16 elements, which corresponds to indices from 0 to 15. However, the program uses `int(raw_input())` to read the input, which can lead to different issues such as:

1. The use of `raw_input()` is incorrect in Python 3; it should be `input()`.
2. If the input is out of the defined range (for instance, if `a` is not within 0 to 15), the program will raise an `IndexError` because it doesn't handle out-of-bound indices.

For instance, if the input is `16`, the program will crash with an error. This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not account for out-of-range inputs, specifically if the input `a` is greater than 15.
