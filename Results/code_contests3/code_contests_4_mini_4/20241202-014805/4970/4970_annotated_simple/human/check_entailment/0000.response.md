Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func()` uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is not defined in Python 3 (it should use `input()` instead). This means the program would raise an error if run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Output Requirements**: The problem description states that the output should be a single integer based on the input integer `a`. However, the program prints a list element directly, which may not correspond to the expected output format.

3. **Output Mapping**: The mapping of input `a` to the output integer is not clear from the problem description. The list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` does not correspond to the output shown in the example (where input `3` yields output `13`). Upon examining the list more closely, `a = 3` leads to an output of `13`, which is correct, but the function does not handle all cases appropriately given that the mapping is hardcoded.

4. **Generalization**: While it might seem to work for the provided example, the program lacks checks or validations for whether the input is truly within the specified bounds of `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`. 

Given these points, the program is not robust and does not satisfactorily address the problem description. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
