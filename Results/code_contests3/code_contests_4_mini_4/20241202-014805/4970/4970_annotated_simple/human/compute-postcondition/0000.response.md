The code takes an input using `raw_input()`, which is then converted to an integer to access an index of the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq 15\), the code effectively returns the value at the index corresponding to the input value. 

Therefore, the output state will include the value of `a` as the input and the corresponding value from the list based on that input.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `a` ≤ 15; the output is the value at the index `a` from the list [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]**.
