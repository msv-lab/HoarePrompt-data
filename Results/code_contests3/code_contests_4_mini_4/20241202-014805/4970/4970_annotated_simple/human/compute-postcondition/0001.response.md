The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a non-negative integer `a` that satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a ≤ 15. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on a non-negative integer `a` within the specified range, though the specifics of the return value are not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function operates on a non-negative integer `a` such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15, but the return value is not specified.**
