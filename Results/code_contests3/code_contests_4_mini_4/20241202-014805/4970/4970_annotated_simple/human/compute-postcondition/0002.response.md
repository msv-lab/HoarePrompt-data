The function `func` accepts no parameters and is designed to print an element from a predefined list based on user input. The input is expected to be a non-negative integer corresponding to an index of the list, which contains 16 elements. The valid range for the input is 0 to 15 (inclusive). If the user inputs a value outside this range, it will result in an `IndexError` because the function does not handle cases where the input is less than 0 or greater than 15. The function does not return any value; it only prints the selected element from the list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts user input as an index to print an element from a predefined list of integers, but it does not handle out-of-bounds indices, potentially causing an `IndexError` for inputs less than 0 or greater than 15. **
