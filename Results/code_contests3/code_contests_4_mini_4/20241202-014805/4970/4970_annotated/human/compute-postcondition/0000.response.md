The code snippet uses `raw_input()` to accept an input value, which is then converted to an integer and used as an index to access an element from a predefined list. The variable `a` is described as a single integer such that `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`, meaning it can take any integer value within that range. However, the exact value of `a` is not given.

The list being accessed is `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which contains 16 elements indexed from 0 to 15. 

Therefore, the value returned from the list will depend on the input provided to `raw_input()`, which is then converted to an integer and used as an index. Since the problem states that `a` can be any integer in the range from 0 to 15, the exact output state cannot be determined without that specific input value.

Output State: **`a` is a single integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 15; the output is the element at index `a` from the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.**
