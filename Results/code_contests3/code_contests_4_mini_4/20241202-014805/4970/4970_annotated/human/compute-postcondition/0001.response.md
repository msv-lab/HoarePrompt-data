The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the internal logic defined within its body. After executing the function, the output is determined by the specific conditions met within the function's logic. Since there are no parameters and the output isn't specified in detail, we cannot describe the functionality in terms of parameters and return values. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and produces output based on internal logic.**
