Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func()` uses `raw_input()` to read the input. In Python 2, `raw_input()` is valid, but in Python 3, it should be `input()`. This discrepancy means that the function may not run correctly in a Python 3 environment, which is more common now.

2. **Output Requirements**: The problem description specifies that the output should be a single integer corresponding to the input integer `a` (which must be between 0 and 15). However, the function does not return the integer; it prints it. While printing the result may seem to fulfill the output requirement, the function does not follow a convention of returning values, which would be a more standard approach for a function designed to compute a value based on input.

3. **IndexError Handling**: The program does not handle the case where the input integer is outside the range of 0 to 15. If the user inputs a number greater than 15 or less than 0, it will raise an `IndexError`, which is not accounted for in the problem description. This leads to undefined behavior for out-of-bounds inputs.

Overall, the function does not properly encapsulate the behavior needed to comply with the specifications of the problem description and is not robust against invalid input scenarios.
