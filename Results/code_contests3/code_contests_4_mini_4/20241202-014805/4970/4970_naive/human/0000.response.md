To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem statement and the given code.

**Problem Description:**
The input is a single integer `a` where \(0 \leq a \leq 15\). The output should be a single integer based on the input.

**Program:**
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Analysis

1. The program uses a list with 16 predefined integers.
2. It reads an integer input using `raw_input()`, which is appropriate for Python 2.x. However, the code will fail in Python 3.x without modification to `input()`.
3. The index used to access the list is directly derived from the input integer, which should be within the range of 0 to 15, as specified by the problem description.

### Edge Cases:

- The program assumes that the input will always be valid (within the range 0 to 15). However, if the user inputs a number outside this range (like -1, 16, or any other non-integer), the program will raise an `IndexError` or `ValueError`.
- The program doesn't handle invalid inputs, which is a significant limitation, as it does not follow the problem's requirements to handle all potential cases.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle cases where the input could be invalid, it fails to meet the problem description's expectations. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly for inputs outside the specified range or for non-integer inputs, which is a violation of the problem's requirements.
