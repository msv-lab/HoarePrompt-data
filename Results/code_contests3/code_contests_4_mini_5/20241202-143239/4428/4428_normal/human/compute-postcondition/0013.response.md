According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `N`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 1. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**.
