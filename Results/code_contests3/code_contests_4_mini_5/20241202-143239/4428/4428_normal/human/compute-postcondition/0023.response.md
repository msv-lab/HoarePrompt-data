Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the number of 'I's and 'D's in the string. If the result is negative, it sets the result to 0. Finally, it prints the result, which reflects the net count of 'I's over 'D's, with a minimum of 0. **
