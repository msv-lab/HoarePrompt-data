The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, but the specific integer is not provided. The variable `S` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**.
