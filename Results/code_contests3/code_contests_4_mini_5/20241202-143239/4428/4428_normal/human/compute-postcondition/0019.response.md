The variable `result` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `result` was less than `0`, so now it is updated to `0`. The other variables, `N` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 0, and `i` is `N`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 0, `i` is `N`**
