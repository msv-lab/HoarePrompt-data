The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `result`, but it is implied that it is a variable that holds a count or a similar value. The other variables `N` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is incremented by 1.**
