According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop iterates for `i` from 0 to `N-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 0. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Thus, after the current iteration, `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1, allowing `i` to be less than `N`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1, and `i` is 1.**
