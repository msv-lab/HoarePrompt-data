The variable `result` is decremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown, and thus it cannot be specified. The variable `N` remains unchanged, and since `N` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop may still execute depending on its value. The variable `i` is unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is decremented by 1.**
