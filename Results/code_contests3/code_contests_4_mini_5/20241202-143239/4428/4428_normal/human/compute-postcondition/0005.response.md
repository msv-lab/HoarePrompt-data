`result` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0, so after execution, `result` becomes 1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, and the element at index `i` of the sequence `S` is still 'I'. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of the sequence `S` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of the sequence `S` is 'I'**.
