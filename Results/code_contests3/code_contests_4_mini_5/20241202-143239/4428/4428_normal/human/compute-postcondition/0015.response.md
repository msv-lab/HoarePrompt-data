The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since `result` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. However, since the code modifies `result`, the output state reflects that the value has been decreased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
