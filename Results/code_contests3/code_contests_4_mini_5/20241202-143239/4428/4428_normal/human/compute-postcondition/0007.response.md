The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since `result` was initially 0, after execution, `result` becomes -1. The values of `N`, `i`, and `S[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character `S[i]` is not 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character `S[i]` is not 'I'.**
