The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly defined in the function signature. However, based on the constraints provided, we understand that the function operates under the assumption that it will utilize a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. 

The function's output is not explicitly described in the prompt, so I cannot define the return value. Therefore, I can only describe the assumptions regarding the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function assumes the existence of a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting of characters 'I' and 'D'.**
