Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to compute the maximum value of `x` during the operations as required by the problem description. Instead, it only calculates the final value of `x` after all operations are performed, and if that value is negative, it sets it to zero. 

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
5
IIDID
```

According to the problem description, we should track the maximum value of `x` throughout the operations. The expected sequence of `x` values would be:
- Initial `x = 0`
- After first 'I': `x = 1` (max = 1)
- After second 'I': `x = 2` (max = 2)
- After first 'D': `x = 1` (max = 2)
- After second 'D': `x = 0` (max = 2)

Thus, the maximum value of `x` is `2`, which is correctly printed by the problem description.

However, the program only calculates the final value of `x`, which would result in `2` for this case, but if we consider a different input like:
```
4
DIDI
```
The expected sequence is:
- Initial `x = 0`
- After first 'D': `x = -1` (max = 0)
- After first 'I': `x = 0` (max = 0)
- After second 'D': `x = -1` (max = 0)
- After second 'I': `x = 0` (max = 0)

The maximum value should still be `0` here, but the program's logic is flawed because it does not maintain a running maximum.

Therefore, the logic to track the maximum value during the operations is missing, leading to the program being incorrect.
