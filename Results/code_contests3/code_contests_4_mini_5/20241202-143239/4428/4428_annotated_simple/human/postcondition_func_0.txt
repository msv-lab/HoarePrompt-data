The function accepts no parameters directly but reads a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the count of 'I' characters and 'D' characters in `S`. If the result is negative, it sets the result to 0 before printing it. Thus, the function effectively counts how many more 'I's there are than 'D's, ensuring the output is non-negative.
