`result` is decremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `result` becomes -1. The states of the other variables (`N` and `i`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `S` is not 'I'.**
