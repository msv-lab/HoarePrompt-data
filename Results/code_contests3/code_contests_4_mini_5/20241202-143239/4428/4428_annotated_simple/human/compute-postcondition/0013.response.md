According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `N` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` must be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `N` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `i` will be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
