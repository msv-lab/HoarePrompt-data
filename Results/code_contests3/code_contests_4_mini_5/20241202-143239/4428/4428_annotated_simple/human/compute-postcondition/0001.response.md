`S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts input as a string. The variable `N` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is an input string.  
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is an input string**
