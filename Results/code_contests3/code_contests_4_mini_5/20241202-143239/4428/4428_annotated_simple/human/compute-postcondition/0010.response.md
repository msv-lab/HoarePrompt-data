The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The value of `N` remains unchanged, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, it can either be 1 or greater. However, we know that for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1, implying `result` is incremented due to the loop condition. The previous value of `i` is 1, which does not change with this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is incremented by 1**
