The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly as per the provided definition. However, it operates on two constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 100\), and `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting only of characters 'I' and 'D'. After executing the function body, it is implied that the function generates some output based on the values of `N` and `S`, although the exact output is not specified in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string S of length N consisting of characters 'I' and 'D'. The output of the function is determined by these constraints.**
