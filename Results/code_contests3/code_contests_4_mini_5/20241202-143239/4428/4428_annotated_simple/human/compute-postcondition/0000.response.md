The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input that is a string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `N` was a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, but we don't know the exact value that will be inputted. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100**
