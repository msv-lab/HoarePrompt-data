The value of `result` is decreased by 1. The value of `result` is not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. However, since the initial state specifies that `N` is a positive integer and `i` is 1, we can note that `result` is affected. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
