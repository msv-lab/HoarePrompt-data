The value of `result` is decremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the previous value of `result`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `result`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
