According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**.
