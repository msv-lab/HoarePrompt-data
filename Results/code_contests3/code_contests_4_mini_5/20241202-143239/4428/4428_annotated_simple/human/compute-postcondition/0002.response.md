The variable `result` is initialized to 0. The values of `N` and `S` are not affected by this assignment, and they retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is an input string; `result` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is an input string; `result` is 0**
