The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the count of 'I' characters and 'D' characters in `S`. If the result of this calculation is negative, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the calculated result. The function prints the final result.
