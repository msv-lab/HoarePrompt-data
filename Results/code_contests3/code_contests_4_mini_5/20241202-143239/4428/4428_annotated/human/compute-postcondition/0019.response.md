The variable `result` is assigned the value of 0, which directly overrides its previous value (the output state indicates that `result` is currently less than 0). The other variables `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 0, `i` is equal to `N`, and `result` was previously less than 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 0, `i` is equal to `N`, and `result` was previously less than 0**
