The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `result` is unknown, but it is assumed to hold a value since it is being modified. The other variables, `N` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, and `result` is increased by 1.**
