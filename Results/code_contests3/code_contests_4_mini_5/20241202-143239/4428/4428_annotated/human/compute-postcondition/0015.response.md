The value of `result` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `result` is unknown based on the given state. The variable `i` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 2; `result` is decreased by 1.**
