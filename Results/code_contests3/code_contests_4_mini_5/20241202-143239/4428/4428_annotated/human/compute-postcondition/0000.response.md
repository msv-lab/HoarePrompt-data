The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input that will be an integer, and `int()` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` remains unchanged as a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` remains unchanged as a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D'**.
