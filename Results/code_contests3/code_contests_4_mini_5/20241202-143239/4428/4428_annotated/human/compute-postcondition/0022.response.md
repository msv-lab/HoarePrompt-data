The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `S`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the characters in the string `S`. 

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D', and return a result based on the combination of these inputs. Since the specific output based on the input parameters is not provided, the exact return value cannot be detailed here. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a string S of length N consisting of 'I' and 'D', and returns a result based on these inputs.**
