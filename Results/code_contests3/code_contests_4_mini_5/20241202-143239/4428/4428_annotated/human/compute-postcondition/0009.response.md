According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
