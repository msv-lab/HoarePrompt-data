According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute for a second time, `N` must be greater than 1. The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2**
