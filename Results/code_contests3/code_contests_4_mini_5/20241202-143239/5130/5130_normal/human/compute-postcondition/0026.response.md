The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Given that `j` is currently 1, `j` will now point to whatever value is stored at `p[1]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `col`, `comps[i]`, and `p`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[1]`, and `p[1]` points to an index in `comps` where the value is 0.**
