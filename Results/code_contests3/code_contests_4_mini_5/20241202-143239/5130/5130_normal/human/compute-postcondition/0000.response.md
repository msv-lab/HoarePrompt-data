The code assigns the value of `n` to be the result of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input value and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, the output state reflects that `n` is now set to the value of the input integer. The other variables `p` and `b` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is set to the input integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with a length equal to n.**
