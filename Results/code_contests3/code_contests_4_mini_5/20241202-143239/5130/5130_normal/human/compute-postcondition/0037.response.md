`col` is incremented by 1. The value of `col` is not specified in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value after the increment. The values of other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1**
