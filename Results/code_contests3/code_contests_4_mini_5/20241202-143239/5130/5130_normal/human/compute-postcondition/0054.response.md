Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`. It calculates the number of distinct components in the permutation and checks if there are no ones in list `b`. If there is only one component, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the number of distinct components, adding 1 if `b` contains only zeros. **
