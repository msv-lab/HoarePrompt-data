According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, meaning that the loop can execute one more time. When the loop executes again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
