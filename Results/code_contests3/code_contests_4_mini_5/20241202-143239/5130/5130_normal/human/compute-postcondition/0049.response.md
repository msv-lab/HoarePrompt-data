Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is the final value after the last increment, `comps[j]` is equal to `col`, `j` is the last value assigned by `p[j]` before the loop terminated, and `comps` has been updated for each `j` in the path followed until `comps[p[j]]` was no longer 0.**
