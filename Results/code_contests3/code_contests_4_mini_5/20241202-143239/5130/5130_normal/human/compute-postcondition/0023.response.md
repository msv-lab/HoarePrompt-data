The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` has already been incremented by 1 and is greater than `j`, it implies that `comps[j]` holds the same value as `col` because `comps[j]` was previously assigned the value of `col`. The other variables, `n` and `i`, are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, and `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`**
