Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` is 0, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and `j` is updated to the last index where `comps[j]` equals `col`, with `comps[j]` equal to `col` for all indices reached through `p` until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0.***
