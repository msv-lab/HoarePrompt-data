The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` has been increased by 1, but since its previous value is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value assigned to `comps[j]`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is `p[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is `p[2]`.**
