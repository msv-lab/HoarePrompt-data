The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is 0, so `comps[j]` will be updated to 0. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is 0, `comps[j]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is 0, `comps[j]` is 0**
