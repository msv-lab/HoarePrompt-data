`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
