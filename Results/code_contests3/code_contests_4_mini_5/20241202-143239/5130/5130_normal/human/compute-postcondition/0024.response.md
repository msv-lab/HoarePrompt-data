The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `j` will also be 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `col`, and `comps[i]`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, and `j` is 1**
