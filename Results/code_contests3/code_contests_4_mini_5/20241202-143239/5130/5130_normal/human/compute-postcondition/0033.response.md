The line of code `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` of the `comps` array. The previous state indicates that `comps[j]` was previously equal to some value, but now it will be set to the current value of `col`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `col`, `comps[i]`, `j`, and `comps[p[j]]`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, and for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0.**
