The value of `j` is updated to `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` was `p[1]` (as stated in the initial state), and now `j` will take the value of `p[j]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[j]` (updated), `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now updated to `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col` and for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[j]` (updated), `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, and for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0.**
