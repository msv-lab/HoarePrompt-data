The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `j` is equal to `p[1]`, which points to an index in `comps` where the value is currently 0, this assignment will update that specific index in `comps` to the value of `col`. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[1]`, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `col` is incremented by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[1]`, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`**
