The code snippet uses `raw_input()` to accept a line of input, which is then split into a list of strings. Each string is converted to an integer and decremented by 1. The resulting list is assigned to `p`. The initial values of `n` and `b` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new value of `p` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is set to the input integer, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with a length equal to n.**
