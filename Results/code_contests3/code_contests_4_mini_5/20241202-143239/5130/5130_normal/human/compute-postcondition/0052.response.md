To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact based on the initial state. 

1. The expression `print(0 if col == 1 else col)` checks if `col` is equal to 1. If it is, it will print `0`; otherwise, it will print the value of `col`.
2. The second part of the expression `+ (1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)` checks the sum of the list `b`. If the sum is `0`, it adds `1` to the result; otherwise, it adds `0`.
3. The overall output will be the result of these two calculations printed together.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `col` or `b`. Therefore, we will reflect the possibilities based on the conditions outlined in the code. 

Assuming `col` can be any integer value greater than or equal to 1 and the sum of `b` can also either be `0` or not `0`, we can summarize the output states based on these conditions.

Output State: **`comps` is a list of identifiers; `col` is greater than or equal to 1; `sum(b)` could be 0 or not 0; output will depend on these conditions.**
