The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is currently 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is 0, `comps[j]` is 0 (after assignment), and `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `col` is 0, `comps[j]` is 0 (after assignment), `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]**
