The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified logic. However, the exact nature of the output is not provided in the prompt. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a list p representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting of zeros and ones with length n.**
