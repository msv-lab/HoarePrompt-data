The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` representing a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It identifies the number of distinct components in the permutation and checks if the sum of list `b` is zero. The function then outputs `0` if there is only one component, or the number of components if there are multiple, and adds `1` if the sum of `b` is zero.
