The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is `p[2]`, but the specific value of `p[2]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the new value of `j`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `col`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, and `col` must be 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, and `col` must be 0**
