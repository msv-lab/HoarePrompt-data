The code `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` of the list `comps`. The variable `j` has a previous value of 2, so `comps[2]` will be updated to the value of `col`. Other variables (`n`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is now equal to `col**
