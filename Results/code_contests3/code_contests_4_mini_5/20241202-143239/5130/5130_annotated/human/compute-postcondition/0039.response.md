`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of `n` and `comps[2]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the updated value of `col` (which is increased by 1).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the updated value of `col` (which is increased by 1)**.
