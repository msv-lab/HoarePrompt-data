`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 2. The value of `j` is updated to `p[j]`, but since we don't have the specific value of `p[j]`, we cannot determine the exact index for `comps`. However, the assignment of `comps[j]` is clear. The values of `n`, `i`, and `col` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2**
