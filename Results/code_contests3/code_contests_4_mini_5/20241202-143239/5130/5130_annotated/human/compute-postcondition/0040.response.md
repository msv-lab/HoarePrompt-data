To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the condition of the loop: `comps[p[j]] == 0`. 

1. **Understanding the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, it must be the case that `comps[p[j]]` is currently 0.

2. **State right before the loop**: We know that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the updated value of `col`. However, we do not have information about the values of `p[j]` or `comps` prior to the loop.

3. **Value of `p[j]`**: We need to ensure that `p[j]` is within the bounds of the `comps` array and that `comps[p[j]]` evaluates to 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjusting the states**: Since `comps[2]` is currently assigned a value based on `col`, we need to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` (which is `comps[p[2]]`) should return a value of 0. Hence, we need to adjust the state corresponding to `comps[p[j]]`.

Given that `p[j]` has not been defined in the states, we cannot make a specific adjustment to `p[j]`. However, we can deduce that if `p[j]` points to an index in `comps` which is not 2, we might need to set that value to 0.

Therefore, we can summarize the required state adjustments as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` needs to be equal to 0**.
