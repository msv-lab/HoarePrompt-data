`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and since `col` is 1 and `i` is 0, `comps[0]` will be updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `comps` is a list with the first element as 1 followed by zeros, and `comps[i]` is equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `comps` is a list with the first element as 1 followed by zeros, and `comps[i]` is equal to 1.**
