Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `comps` is the updated list where all elements that were initially 0 and were accessed through the pointers in `p` have been set to 1, and `j` is the last accessed index in `p` that led to a non-zero value in `comps`.**
