`col` is assigned the value of 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros; `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros; `col` is 0**.
