In the given code, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `j` holds the value of `p[2]`, which is not specified but can be assumed to be known within the context. The variable `col` is initialized to 0. Therefore, `comps[j]` will be updated to 0. 

The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, but the value of the element at index `j` in the list `comps` will be updated to 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, `col` is 0, and `comps[j]` is set to 0.**
