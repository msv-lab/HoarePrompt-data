The variable `p` is assigned a new list where each element is derived from the input provided by `raw_input()`. The input consists of integers, which are split by spaces and each integer `v` is converted to an integer and then decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `p` will hold a valid permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 (since they are decremented by 1). The values of `b` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 derived from the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 derived from the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones.**
