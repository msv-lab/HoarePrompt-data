According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
