`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 2. The previous value of `comps[j]` is not specified, but `col` is confirmed to be 2. Other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment that took place.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `col` is 2, `comps[j]` is 2, and `j` is updated to `p[j]**
