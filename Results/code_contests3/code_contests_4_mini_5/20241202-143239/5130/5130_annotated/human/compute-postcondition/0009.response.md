`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `comps` is a list with the first element as 1 followed by zeros, and `comps[i]` is equal to 1; `j` is 0.
