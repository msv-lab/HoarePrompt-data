The value of `j` is assigned to `p[j]`, but we do not know the specific values of `p` or the current value of `j`. Therefore, the output state must reflect that `j` has been updated based on the value of `p`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `j` is updated to p[j]**
