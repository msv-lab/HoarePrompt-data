Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, and `col` is 1 if `comps[i]` is 0, with `comps` being updated to where all elements that were initially 0 and accessed through the pointers in `p` are set to 1, and `j` is the last accessed index in `p` that led to a non-zero value in `comps`.***
