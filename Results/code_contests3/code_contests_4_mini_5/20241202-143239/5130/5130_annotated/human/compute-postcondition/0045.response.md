`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `j` is equal to `p[2]`, and `comps[p[2]]` is equal to 0, which means that `comps[j]` (or `comps[p[2]]`) is updated to `col`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the contents of `comps` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`**.
