`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is 1. Therefore, the value of `comps[j]` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `col`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `comps[j]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, `comps[j]` is now 1**
