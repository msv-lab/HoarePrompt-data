According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `comps[j]` is now 1, which means `comps[p[j]]` must also be 0 for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `p[j]` has a value that results in `comps[p[j]]` being 0.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `comps[p[j]]` is indeed 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `col` is 1, for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
