The list `comps` is created with `n` elements, all initialized to `0`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the list will have the same number of elements as the value of `n`, and all elements will be set to `0`. The other variables (`p` and `b`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.**
