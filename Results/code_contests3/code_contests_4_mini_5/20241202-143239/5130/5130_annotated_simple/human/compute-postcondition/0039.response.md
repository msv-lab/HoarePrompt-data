`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `j` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is the incremented value, `j` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is the incremented value, `j` is 2**
