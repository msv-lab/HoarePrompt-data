Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[0]` is 1; `col` is increased by the number of iterations executed; `j` is updated to the last value of `p[j]` that caused the loop to terminate; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The loop stops when `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0.**
