The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is unknown, but since the loop is set to execute a second time, we can assume that `col` has been initialized previously. The values of `n` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, and `col` is increased by 1.**
