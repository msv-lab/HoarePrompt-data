`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `comps[j]` is not specified, but `col` has been increased by 1, and `comps[p[1]]` is equal to `col`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is equal to `col`; `j` is now equal to `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is equal to `col`; `j` is now equal to `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.**
