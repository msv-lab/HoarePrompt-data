Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; if `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `col` is increased by the number of iterations, and `comps[p[j]]` is set to `col` for all indices visited by `j`, where `j` is the last value assigned before `comps[p[j]]` became non-zero.***
