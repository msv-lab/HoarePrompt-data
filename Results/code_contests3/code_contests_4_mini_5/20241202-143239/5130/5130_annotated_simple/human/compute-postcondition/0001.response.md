To analyze the code:

1. The variable `p` is assigned a list comprehension that takes input from `raw_input()`, splits it by spaces, converts each value to an integer, and then subtracts 1 from each integer.
2. The input for `raw_input()` will be a string representation of `n` integers (which are expected to be a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`).
3. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer and doesn't provide the specific values of `p` or `b`, we will assume `p` will be populated based on the input from `raw_input()`.

After executing the line of code, the list `p` will contain integers from the input, each reduced by 1. The variable `b` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`.**
