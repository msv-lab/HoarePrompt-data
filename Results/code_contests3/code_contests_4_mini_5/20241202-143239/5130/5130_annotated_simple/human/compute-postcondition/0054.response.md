Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary list `b` of length `n`. It computes the number of distinct components in the permutation represented by `p`. If there is only one component, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the number of components. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `b` is 0, it adds 1 to the result, effectively returning `col` if there are multiple components, or 1 if there are no components and `b` consists entirely of zeros. **
