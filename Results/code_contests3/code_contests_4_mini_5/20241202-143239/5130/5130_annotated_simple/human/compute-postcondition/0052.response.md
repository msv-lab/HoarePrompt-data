To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet provided. 

1. The expression `print(0 if col == 1 else col)` checks the value of `col`:
   - If `col` is equal to 1, it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the value of `col`.

2. The second part of the expression `(1 if sum(b) == 0 else 0)` evaluates whether the sum of the list `b` is equal to 0:
   - If the sum is 0, it evaluates to `1`.
   - If the sum is not 0, it evaluates to `0`.

3. The results of both expressions are combined by the `+` operator, but since the first part is printed, the actual output will be the result of the `print` function.

Without specific values for `col` and `b`, we cannot calculate the exact numeric output but we can describe the conditions affecting the output.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`comps` contains integers representing the component labels of the permutation from `p`, `col` is either 0 or its distinct component count, and the result of evaluating `sum(b)` is either 0 or not 0.**
