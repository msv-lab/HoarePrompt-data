The code initializes a list `comps` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The value of `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The other variables `p` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `comps`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all set to 0.**
