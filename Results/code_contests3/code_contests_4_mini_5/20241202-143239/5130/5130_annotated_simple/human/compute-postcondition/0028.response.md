According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[1]]` is now equal to `col`, meaning that `comps[p[1]]` is not equal to 0 (since `col` has been increased by 1). 

Since `j` is `p[1]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `comps[p[j]]`, which is `comps[p[p[1]]]`, must remain equal to 0. Therefore, we need to adjust `comps[p[j]]` to ensure that it is still equal to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is `p[1] and for the loop to execute again comps[p[j]] is equal to 0**
