According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, as long as `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1, and the updated state will reflect that `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
