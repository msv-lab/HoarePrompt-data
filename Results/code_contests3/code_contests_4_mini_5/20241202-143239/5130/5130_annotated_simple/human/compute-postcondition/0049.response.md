Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is the final incremented value; `j` is the last value assigned by `p[j]` before the loop terminates; `comps` has been updated such that `comps[p[j]]` and all previous `comps[j]` values assigned during the loop are equal to `col`.**
