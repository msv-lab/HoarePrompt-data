`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is `p[1]`, and since `comps[p[1]]` was previously 0, it will now be updated to the value of `col`, which has been increased by 1. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is `p[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is `p[1]**
