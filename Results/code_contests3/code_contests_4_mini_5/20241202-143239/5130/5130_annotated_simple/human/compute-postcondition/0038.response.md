`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is increased by 1, meaning that it now holds a new value (let's denote it as the previous value of `col` plus 1). The value of `i` is 2, so the assignment affects the third element of the `comps` list (indexing starts at 0). Therefore, the value of `comps[2]` will now be equal to the incremented value of `col`. The output state will reflect that `n` remains unchanged, `i` is still 2, and `col` has been incremented. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is the incremented value**
