The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, the value of `comps[0]` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, the value of `comps[0]` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1.**
