Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; if `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `comps` has been updated such that `comps[p[j]]` and all previous `comps[j]` values assigned during the loop are equal to `col`, with `col` being the final incremented value and `j` being the last value assigned by `p[j]` before the loop terminates.***
