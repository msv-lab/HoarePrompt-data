According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute, the value of `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. 

Right before the loop, we know that `j` is 1. Thus, we need to ensure that `comps[p[1]]` is equal to 0. The state of `comps` and the value of `p[1]` need to be such that `comps[p[j]]` is indeed 0. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and does not directly influence the execution of the loop in this context, we focus on the other variables. 

To allow the loop to execute for the first time, we should have:
- `comps[p[1]]` must be 0 (this is the key condition for the loop to execute).

So, we adjust the state to reflect this requirement without changing the values of `n`, `i`, or `col`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is 0; `j` is 1**
