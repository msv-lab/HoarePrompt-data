The variable `col` is assigned the value 0. Other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all set to 0; `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones; `comps` is a list of integers with `n` elements, all set to 0; `col` is 0.**
