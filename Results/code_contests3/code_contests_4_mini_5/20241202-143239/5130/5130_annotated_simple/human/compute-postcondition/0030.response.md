`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` has already been increased by 1 and `comps[p[1]]` is equal to `col`, the value of `comps[j]` becomes equal to `col`. The variables `n`, `i`, `col`, and `comps` are affected by this assignment, but their specific values beyond the relationships given are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is equal to `col`; `j` is `p[1]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[p[1]]` is equal to `col`; `j` is `p[1]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.**
