The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on three implicit parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \).
- `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`.

After executing the function body, the behavior of the function is not explicitly stated in the output. Therefore, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function processes a positive integer `n`, a permutation list `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, and a binary list `b` of length `n`. The specifics of the return value or behavior based on these inputs are not provided.**
