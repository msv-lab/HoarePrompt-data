According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the parameter `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
