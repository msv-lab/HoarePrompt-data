`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `i` is 0, and `col` is increased by 1, so the new value of `col` is 1. Therefore, `comps[0]` is now assigned the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[0]` is 1; `col` is increased by 1**
