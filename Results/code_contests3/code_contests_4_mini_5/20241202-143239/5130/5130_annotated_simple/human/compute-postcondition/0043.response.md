According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is equal to `p[2]`, and `comps[p[j]]` is equal to `col`. For the loop to execute one more time, this means that `comps[p[j]]` must still be equal to 0. Since `comps[p[j]]` is currently equal to `col`, which is the incremented value, `col` must be adjusted to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `col` so that it reflects a situation where `comps[p[j]]` is still 0. This implies that `col` must not be equal to the value that would indicate `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `col` is the incremented value and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` is still equal to 0.**
