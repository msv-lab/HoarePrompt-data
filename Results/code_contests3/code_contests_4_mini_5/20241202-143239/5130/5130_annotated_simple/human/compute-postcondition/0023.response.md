`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and since `i` is 1, `comps[1]` will now hold the value of `col`. The value of `col` is increased by 1, but its specific value is not provided. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col.**
