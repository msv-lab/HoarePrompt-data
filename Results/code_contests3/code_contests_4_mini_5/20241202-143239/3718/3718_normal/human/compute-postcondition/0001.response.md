The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two cities. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integer coordinates for two cities and return the Euclidean distance between them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 as integers representing coordinates of two cities, and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities.**
