The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities based on their coordinates. The function does not handle any potential edge cases such as checking for invalid input types or ensuring the inputs are within the specified range; it simply computes the distance using the Euclidean formula.
