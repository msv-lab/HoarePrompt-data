#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities, and they are such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| â‰¤ 10^4.
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities (x1, y1, x2, y2) and returns the Euclidean distance between these two points in a 2D plane. The function does not handle any potential errors related to the input type or values, assuming that the inputs provided will always be valid integers within the specified range.
