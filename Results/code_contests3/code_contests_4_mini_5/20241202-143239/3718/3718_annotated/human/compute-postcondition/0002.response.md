Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`, which represent the coordinates of two different cities. It calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between these cities using the formula `sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)`. There are no checks for the validity of the input coordinates or the range of the values, but it assumes that the inputs are valid integers within the specified limits. **
