The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All these parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities. After executing the function body, it calculates the distance between the two cities using their coordinates. The function returns the distance calculated using the formula involving the square root of the difference in coordinates. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the integer coordinates of two cities and return the distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 (all integers representing the coordinates of two different cities) and returns the distance between these two cities calculated using their coordinates.**
