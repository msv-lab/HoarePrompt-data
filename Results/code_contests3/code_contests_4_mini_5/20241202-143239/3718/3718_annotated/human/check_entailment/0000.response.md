The provided program only calculates the Euclidean distance between two cities given their coordinates. However, the problem description requires determining the minimum detection radius for a radar that can detect movements from two attacking enemy rings surrounding the cities. 

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to consider not only the distance between the cities but also the radii of the circles (the enemy rings) surrounding those cities. The correct computation would involve calculating the distance between the two cities, subtracting the radii of their respective circles to find the overlap or gap, and then determining the minimum radius needed for the radar to detect the approaching enemy. 

The current implementation does not address these requirements, as it ignores the radii of the enemy rings and does not provide a method to calculate the minimum detection radius based on both the distance between the cities and the radii of the circles.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
