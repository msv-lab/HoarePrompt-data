The function accepts an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0 or 1) representing compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. It calculates the number of ways to pair each man with a woman such that only compatible pairs (indicated by 1 in the list) are chosen. The result is printed as the number of valid pairings modulo 1000000007.
