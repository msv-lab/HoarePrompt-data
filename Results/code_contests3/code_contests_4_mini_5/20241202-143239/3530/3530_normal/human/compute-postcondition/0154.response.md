The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value of the `dp` array at the indices `[i][mask]`. The variable `i` is 3 and `mask` is 3. The expression on the right-hand side involves the calculation of `mask ^ 1 << j`. 

Here are the steps:
1. `1 << j` calculates `1` shifted left by `j` (which is 2), resulting in `4` (binary `100`).
2. `mask ^ 4` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `mask` (3, binary `11`) and `4` (binary `100`), resulting in `7` (binary `111`).
3. The value at `dp[i - 1][7]` is added to `dp[i][mask]`. The value of `dp[i - 1][7]` is not specified, so we will refer to it as `dp[2][7]`. 

The output state reflects the changes, noting that `dp[i][mask]` is adjusted based on `dp[2][7]`. Since we don't have specific values for the `dp` array, the output state will be described in general terms.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2; `dp[3][3]` is updated by adding `dp[2][7]`.**
