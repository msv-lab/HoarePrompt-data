Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulus with `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no update to `dp[i][mask]`.***
