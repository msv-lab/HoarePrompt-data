Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`. `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions for all values of `j` from 0 to `n - 1` where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
