Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `n + 1`, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, the operation on `dp[i][mask]` is performed, but its result is unspecified.***
