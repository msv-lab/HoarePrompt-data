Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is equal to the length of `a[i - 1]`, and `dp[2][3]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the conditions evaluated during all iterations of the loop.**
