According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `mask` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1, and `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2. This means that `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `mask` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `mask` becoming 2. Also, since `mask` must remain less than `1 << n`, `n` must still satisfy that condition.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[3][1]` has been updated based on the values of `dp[2][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n - 1` where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND `1 << j` is true.**
