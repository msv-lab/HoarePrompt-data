Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur.***
