Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that \(2^n\) is greater than 3, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true.***
