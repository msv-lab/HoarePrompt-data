According to the code, the loop is defined to execute `n` times, where `n` is a string that must be convertible to an integer greater than 1. Given that `j` is initialized as `n - 1`, it indicates that `j` is currently one less than the value of `n`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to start executing from the beginning.

For the loop to execute a second time, `mask` must be less than \(2^n\). This means that the current value of `mask` (which is 2) should be less than \(2^n\). Since `N` is between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` must also represent a valid integer value greater than 1 that satisfies the condition \(2 < 2^n\). 

Since `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, the smallest valid integer greater than 1 is 2 (which gives \(2^2 = 4\)). Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

In summary, we need the following states for the loop to execute:
1. `n` must be a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, and at least 2.
2. `j` must be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute from the start.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1 (at least 2), `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute a second time `mask` must be less than `2^n`**
