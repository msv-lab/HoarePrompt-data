Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` is bitwise ANDed with `1 << j`, then `dp[2][1]` is updated and taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
