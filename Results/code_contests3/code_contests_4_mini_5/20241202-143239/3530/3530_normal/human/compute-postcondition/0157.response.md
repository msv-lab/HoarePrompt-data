Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer of at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is at least 3 (but could be less if n is less than 3); `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for each valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true.**
