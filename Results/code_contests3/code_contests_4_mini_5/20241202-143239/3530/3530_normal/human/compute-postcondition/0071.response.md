Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo with `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no else part to execute.***
