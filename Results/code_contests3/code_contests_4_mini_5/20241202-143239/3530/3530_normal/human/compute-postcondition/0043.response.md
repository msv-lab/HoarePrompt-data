Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is 2; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is modified by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
