The code prints the value of `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]`. The expression `(1 << n)` computes `2^n`, and subtracting 1 from it results in `2^n - 1`, which is the value of `mask`. Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, and `dp[n][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during all iterations, the output will depend on the specific value of `n` and the contents of the `dp` table.

Since we don't have the specific values of `dp[n][mask]`, we can only state that the output will be that value. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed**.
