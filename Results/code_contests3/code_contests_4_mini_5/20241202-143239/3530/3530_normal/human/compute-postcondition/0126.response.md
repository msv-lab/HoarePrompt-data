Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[3][1]` is updated by adding `dp[2][5]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.***
