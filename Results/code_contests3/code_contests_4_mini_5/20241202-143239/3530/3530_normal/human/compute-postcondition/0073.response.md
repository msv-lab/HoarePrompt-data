The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` impacts the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`. 

1. The index `i` is currently 2.
2. The value of `mask` is 1.
3. The value of `j` is 1, so `1 << j` equals `2` (which is the binary representation of `10`).
4. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` translates to `1 ^ 2`, which results in `3` (as `01 XOR 10` equals `11` in binary).
5. This means the operation is updating the value of `dp[2][1]` by adding the value of `dp[1][3]` to it.

Since the values of `dp` are not provided, the output state can only reflect the changes made by the operation without specific numeric outputs.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; dp[2][1] is updated by adding dp[1][3].**
