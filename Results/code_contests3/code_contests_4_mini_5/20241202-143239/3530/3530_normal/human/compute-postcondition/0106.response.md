According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2**
