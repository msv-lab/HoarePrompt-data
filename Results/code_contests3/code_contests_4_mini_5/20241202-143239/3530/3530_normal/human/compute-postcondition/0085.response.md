Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1 (at least 2), `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, `mask` is less than `2^n`, the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it; `dp[i][mask]` is then taken modulo `MOD`.**
