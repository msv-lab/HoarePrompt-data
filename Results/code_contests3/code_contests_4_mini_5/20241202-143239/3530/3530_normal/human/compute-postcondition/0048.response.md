Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `mask` is 2; `dp[1][2]` is modified based on the values of `a[0][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n - 1` where `mask & 1 << j` is true, and taken modulo `MOD`.**
