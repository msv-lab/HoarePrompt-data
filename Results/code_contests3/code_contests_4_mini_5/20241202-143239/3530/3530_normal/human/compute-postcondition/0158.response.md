Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `mask` is `2^n - 1`, `j` is at least `n`, and `dp[3][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop for all valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` is true.**
