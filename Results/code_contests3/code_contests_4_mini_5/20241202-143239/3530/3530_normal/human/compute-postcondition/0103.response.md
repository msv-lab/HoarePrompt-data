In the provided code snippet, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values from a previous state of the `dp` array. The operation involves a bitwise XOR operation between `mask` and `1 << j`, where `j` is 1. 

1. The previous value of `i` is 2, and `mask` is 3.
2. The expression `1 << j` computes to `1 << 1`, which equals 2 in decimal.
3. The XOR operation `mask ^ (1 << j)` translates to `3 ^ 2`, which equals 1. Therefore, it references `dp[i - 1][1]`.
4. The value of `dp[2][3]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[1][1]` to it. However, we do not have the specific values of the `dp` array, so we cannot definitively state the new value of `dp[2][3]`.

Since we don't know the value of `dp[1][1]`, we can't specify the exact updated value of `dp[2][3]`, but we can state that it has been affected. 

The output state remains focused on the affected variables and their conditions:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**.
