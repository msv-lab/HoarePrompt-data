According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `n` is a string convertible to an integer that is greater than 1, we can infer that `n` must be at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `mask` is `2^n - 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[2][mask]` has been updated based on all valid conditions evaluated during the loop iterations.**
