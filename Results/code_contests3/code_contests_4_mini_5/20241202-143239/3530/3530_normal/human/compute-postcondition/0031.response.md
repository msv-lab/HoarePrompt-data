The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. The variables `i`, `mask`, and `dp[i][mask]` are directly affected by this operation. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not specified, but the operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` will be adjusted to fit within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value and taken modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value and taken modulo `MOD`.**
