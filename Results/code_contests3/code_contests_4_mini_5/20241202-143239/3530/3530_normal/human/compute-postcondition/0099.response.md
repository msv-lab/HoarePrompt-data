The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables affected are `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, we calculate `mask ^ 1 << j` which results in `mask ^ 1` (since `1 << 0` is 1). This operation flips the least significant bit of `mask`. 

The exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value from the previous state.

Therefore, the output state indicates the operation performed without specifying exact numbers, as the exact values depend on the previous content of the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1]`**
