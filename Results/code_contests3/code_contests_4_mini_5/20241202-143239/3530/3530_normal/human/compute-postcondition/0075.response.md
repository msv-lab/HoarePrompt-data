Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[2][1]` is updated to `dp[2][1] % MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
