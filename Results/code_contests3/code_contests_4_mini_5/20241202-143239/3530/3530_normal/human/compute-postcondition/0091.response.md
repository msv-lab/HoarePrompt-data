According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`, which is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must also be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2**
