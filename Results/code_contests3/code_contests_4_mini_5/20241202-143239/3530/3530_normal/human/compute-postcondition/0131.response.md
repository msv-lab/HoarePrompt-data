The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The previous state indicates that `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 0. The expression `mask ^ (1 << j)` calculates to `2 ^ (1 << 0)` which is `2 ^ 1 = 3`. Therefore, we are updating `dp[3][2]` by adding `dp[2][3]`.

Since the specific value of `dp[2][3]` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[3][2]`. However, we can state that `dp[3][2]` is updated based on the value from `dp[2][3]`.

Output State: **`dp[3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[2][3]`**
