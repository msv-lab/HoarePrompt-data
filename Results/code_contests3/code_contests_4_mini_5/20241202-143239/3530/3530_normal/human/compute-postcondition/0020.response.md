According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a string that must be convertible to an integer greater than 0, it must be adjusted accordingly to ensure it meets this condition. The variable `i` is already initialized to 1, and `j` will take values starting from 0 in the loop. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a string that, when converted to an integer, is greater than 0. 

Thus, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `n` is a valid string representing a number greater than 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is a string that represents an integer greater than 0, and `j` is 0**
