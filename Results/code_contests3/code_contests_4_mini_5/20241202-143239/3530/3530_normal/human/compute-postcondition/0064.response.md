Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `mask` is equal to `2^n - 1` (the maximum value of mask for the range), `dp[1][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during all iterations of the nested loops, and `j` has iterated through all values from 0 to `n - 1`.**
