According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is a string that is convertible to an integer greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

For the loop to execute again, `n` must also still be greater than 2 after converting `n` from a string to an integer.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2.**
