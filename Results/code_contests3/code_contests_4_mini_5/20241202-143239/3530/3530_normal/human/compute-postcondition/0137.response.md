Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, then `dp[3][2]` is updated with a modulo operation. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
