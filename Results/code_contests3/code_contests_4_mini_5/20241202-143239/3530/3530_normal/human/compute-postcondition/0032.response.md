Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous value and taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no update occurs to `dp[i][mask]`.***
