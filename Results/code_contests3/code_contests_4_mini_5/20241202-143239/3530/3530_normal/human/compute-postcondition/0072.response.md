According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which takes values from 0 to `n-1`. The current value of `j` is 0, and since `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, it means `n` must be at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be 1. There are no conditions preventing the loop from executing again since `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
