According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current value of `j`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is 2, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, then `dp[1][2]` is modified by `dp[0][3]` and taken modulo `MOD`.**
