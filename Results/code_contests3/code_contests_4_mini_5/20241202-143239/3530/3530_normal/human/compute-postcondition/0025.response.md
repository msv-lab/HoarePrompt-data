According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
