Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, the state of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
