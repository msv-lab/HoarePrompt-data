According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is greater than the current iteration count (which will be incremented with each loop iteration), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive. Since the variable `_` is used as a placeholder and does not influence the state, we need to consider the current iteration count.

If `N` is 21, after the last iteration of the loop it will have executed 21 times, meaning it cannot execute again. If `N` is any number less than 21, it means the loop has executed (N - 1) times, thus allowing for one more execution.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than the current iteration count which can be inferred as `_` (the loop index). Therefore, if the loop has executed `x` times and `N` is greater than `x`, the next state will adjust `N` to still be valid for further iterations.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than the current iteration count (which is less than N)**.
