The code modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are given as `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. 

To calculate the effect:
- `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `2 ^ (1 << 1)`, which is `2 ^ 2`, resulting in `0`.
- Therefore, the expression becomes `dp[3][2] += dp[2][0]`.

The output state will describe the relevant variables and the operation performed. The specific values of `dp` are not provided, so we cannot determine exact values, only the operation that is performed. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is a string convertible to an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1; `dp[3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[2][0]` to it.**
