According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = n - 1`. Given that `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. 

Since it is stated that `j` is equal to `n - 1`, this means that the loop has already completed its iterations, and `j` cannot be initialized to a value to start a new iteration. To adjust the state for the loop to execute again, we need to reset `j` to 0 and ensure that `n` remains at least 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `n` must be at least 1,
- `j` should be reset to 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
