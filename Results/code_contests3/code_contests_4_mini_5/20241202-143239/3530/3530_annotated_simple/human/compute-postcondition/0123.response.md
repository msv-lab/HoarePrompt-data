According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
