Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and \(1 << j\) is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
