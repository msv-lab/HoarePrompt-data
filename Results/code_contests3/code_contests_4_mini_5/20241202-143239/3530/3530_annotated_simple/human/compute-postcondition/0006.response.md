The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element into an integer, and appends the resulting iterable of integers to the list `a`. The variable `N` is not directly affected by this execution, and `_` remains 1, indicating that the loop will execute a second time. The output state will reflect the new contents of the list `a` after the input is processed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `_` is 1, and `a` now contains a new list of integers appended from user input.**
