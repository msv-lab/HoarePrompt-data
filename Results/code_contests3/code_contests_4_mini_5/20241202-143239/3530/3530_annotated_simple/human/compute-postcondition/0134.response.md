According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will iterate over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making `j` equal to `n`. However, since the loop condition is `j < n`, it will not execute again if `j` is equal to `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be adjusted so that it is greater than `n - 1`, which is no longer possible since `n` is fixed. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n`, for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible.**
