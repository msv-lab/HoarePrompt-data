The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
