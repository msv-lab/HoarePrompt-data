Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, and `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\). If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with \(1 << j\) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and is then taken modulo `MOD`.***
