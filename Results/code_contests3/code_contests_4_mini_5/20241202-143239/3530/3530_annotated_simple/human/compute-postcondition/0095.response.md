Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), `j` will have taken all values from 0 to `n-1`. The final value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, and this sum will be taken modulo `MOD`.**
