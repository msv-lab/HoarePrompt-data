According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than `n`, which it will be if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is equal to the next value (previous `mask` + 1) which is less than \(2^n\), `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
