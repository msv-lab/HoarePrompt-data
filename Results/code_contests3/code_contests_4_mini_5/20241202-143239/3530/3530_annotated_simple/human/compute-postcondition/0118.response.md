Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, and if the element at position `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.***
