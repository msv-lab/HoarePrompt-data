According to the code, for the loop to execute a second time, the loop variable `j` must be less than `n`. Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, we need to ensure that `n` is also within this range (1 to 21). Additionally, after the first iteration, `j` would be equal to 1 if it was 0 during the first iteration. The `mask` must be set to the next value after the first iteration as well.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time:
- `n` must be greater than 1 to allow for a second iteration,
- `j` is now 1 after the first execution,
- `mask` is set to the next value.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, for the loop to execute a second time `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration**
