Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and if for each `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the corresponding values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, with `dp[i][mask]` taken modulo `MOD`.**
