The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

1. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` will be incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
2. Here, `mask` is currently `1`, and `j` is `0`, thus `1 << j` equals `1`. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `1 ^ 1`, which results in `0`.
3. Therefore, the value added to `dp[i][mask]` is `dp[i - 1][0]`.

The other variables (`N`, `n`, `mask`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]`) are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, the element at position `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`.**
