Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[i][mask]` reflects the results based on the updates made during the loop iterations, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute, `mask` is less than `2^N`, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.***
