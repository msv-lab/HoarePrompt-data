The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` is reassigned to the remainder when it is divided by `MOD`. The values of `N`, `j`, and other variables are not directly affected by this operation, but the value of `dp[i][mask]` changes. 

Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, and `j` is defined as `k + 1`, we assume `k` is also an integer but its specific value is not provided. The effect of the modulus operation depends on the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD`, which are not specified.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive; `j` is `k + 1`; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
