According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. If `n` is greater than 1, then `_` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `_` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
