Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`, `i` is `2^N - 1`, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0. The element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the result of `mask & 1 << j` is true.***
