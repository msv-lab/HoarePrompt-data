Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration, the element at `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 while `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
