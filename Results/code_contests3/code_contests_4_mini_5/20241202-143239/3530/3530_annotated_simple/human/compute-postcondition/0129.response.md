According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `j` starts at `n - 1`, which is valid as long as `n` is at least 1. 

Therefore, the states that need to be maintained or adjusted before the loop can execute are as follows: `N` remains an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `mask` is set to 2, and `j` is initialized to `n - 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`**
