According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the condition set by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `1 << n` (which is equivalent to \(2^n\)). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since `N` is between 1 and 21, \(2^N\) will be between 2 and \(2^{21}\). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, it must be that \(2^N\) is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than or equal to 1**
