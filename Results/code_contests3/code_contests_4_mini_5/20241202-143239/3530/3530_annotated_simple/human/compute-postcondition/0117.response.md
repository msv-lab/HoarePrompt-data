The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified, but the specific values before this operation are not provided in the initial state. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, the element at position `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
