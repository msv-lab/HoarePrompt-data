Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n - 1`, if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
