The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operator with `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is being modified. The other variables (`N`, `j`, and the previous state of `dp`) remain unchanged as this operation only affects `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is updated using modulo `MOD`.**
