The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The values of `N`, `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain unchanged, but the expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`, `i` is `2^N - 1`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0; `dp[i][mask]` is updated but remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`, `i` is `2^N - 1`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0; `dp[i][mask]` is updated but remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`.**
