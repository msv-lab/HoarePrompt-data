According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `N` is between 1 and 21 inclusive, meaning `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
