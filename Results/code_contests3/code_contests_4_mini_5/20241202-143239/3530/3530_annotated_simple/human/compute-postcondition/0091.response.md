According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`. 

Thus, if `j` is currently less than `n`, it can be assumed that the next state at the start of the loop will have `j` equal to that incremented value. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, and `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be increased to `j + 1` (which is now less than `n`), and `mask` remains unchanged.**
