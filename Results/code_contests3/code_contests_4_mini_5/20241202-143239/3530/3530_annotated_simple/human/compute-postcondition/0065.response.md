According to the code, the loop is executed for `i` ranging from 1 to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute again. Given that `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, we need to determine the state for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current value of the loop counter. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`, and it should still be less than or equal to `n`.

Let's denote the next value of `i` as `i + 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n`. Hence, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[i][mask]` reflects the final results based on all updates made during the loop iterations, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least `i + 1`**
