According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration.**
