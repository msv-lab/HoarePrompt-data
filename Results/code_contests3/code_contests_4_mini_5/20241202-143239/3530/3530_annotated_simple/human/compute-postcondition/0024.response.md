Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`, `i` is `2^N - 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated while remaining within the bounds defined by `MOD`.***
