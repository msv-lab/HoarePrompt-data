According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute `N` times, and since `_` is currently 0 at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute a second time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive. For the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be at least 1, which it is. After the next iteration, `_` will be 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `_` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
