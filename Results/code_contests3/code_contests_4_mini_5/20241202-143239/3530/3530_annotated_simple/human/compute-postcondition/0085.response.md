The expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, the bitwise AND of `mask` and \(1 << j\) is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.**
