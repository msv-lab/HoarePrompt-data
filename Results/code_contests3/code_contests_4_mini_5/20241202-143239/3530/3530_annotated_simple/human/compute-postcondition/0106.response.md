According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is the next value less than \(2^n\), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
