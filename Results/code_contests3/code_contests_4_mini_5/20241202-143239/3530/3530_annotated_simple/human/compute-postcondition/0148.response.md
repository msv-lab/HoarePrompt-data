Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][3]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is not 1 or the condition is false, no changes are made to `dp[i][3]`.***
