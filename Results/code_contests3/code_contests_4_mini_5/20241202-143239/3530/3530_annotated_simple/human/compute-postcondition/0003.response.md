According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, so `n` must be a positive integer. Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, it does not affect the loop execution directly. However, since `n` is an input string, it must be converted to an integer for the loop to work. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` needs to be converted to an integer that is at least 1. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `a` is an empty 2D list, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be a string that represents an integer greater than 0, and `_` is 0 for the first iteration.**
