According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Given that `j` is currently 0, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and if the element at position `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`.**
