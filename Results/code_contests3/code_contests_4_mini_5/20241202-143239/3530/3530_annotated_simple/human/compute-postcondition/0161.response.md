The function `func` does not have any parameters, but it operates on two constraints: `N`, which is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, and `a`, a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. Since the specific output conditions are not provided, we cannot detail the return values. However, based on the constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is likely related to processing the compatibility data represented by `a` for `N` men and women. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on a 2D list of compatibility data for N men and N women, where N is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive.**
