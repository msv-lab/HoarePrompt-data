Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), the next value of `mask` will be \(mask + 1\), `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and \(1 << j\) is non-zero (indicating that the j-th bit of mask is set).***
