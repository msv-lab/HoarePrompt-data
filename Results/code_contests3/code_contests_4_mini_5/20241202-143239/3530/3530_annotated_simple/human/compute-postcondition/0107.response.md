The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, but we know that `j` is 2. The `mask` is less than \(2^n\), and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is a valid index. The values of `dp` are not specified, so we cannot determine exact numerical results but can indicate a change in state.

The output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on a previous value, but without specific values for `dp`, `i`, and `mask`, we can only describe the change conceptually.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, where `j` is 2, `mask` is less than \(2^n\), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive.**
