The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The values of `N`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` are not directly affected by this line; however, the value of `dp[i][mask]` will change based on its previous value.

Since `dp[i][mask]` was previously updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, the output state will reflect the new value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulus operation. However, the exact values cannot be determined from the given information.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulus with `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulus with `MOD`.**
