The code snippet updates the dynamic programming table `dp` at the index `i` and the given `mask`. The value at `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `mask ^ 1 << j` calculates a new mask by flipping the `j`-th bit of the current mask. The values of `N`, `n`, `j`, and `mask` remain unchanged, but the value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than 2^n - 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
