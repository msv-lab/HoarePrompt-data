According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied as stated. The loop iterates using `j`, which starts at 0 and will increase by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Given that `j` is stated to be less than `n`, it must be initialized to 0 or any integer less than `n` for the loop to begin executing. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are ensuring that `j` starts from 0 to ensure immediate execution of the loop. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
