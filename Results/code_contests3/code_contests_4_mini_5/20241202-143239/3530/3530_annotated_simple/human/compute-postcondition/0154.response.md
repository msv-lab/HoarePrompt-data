The code snippet modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `mask`, which is 3, and `j`, which is 2. 

To analyze the expression `mask ^ 1 << j`:
- `1 << j` shifts the number 1 to the left by `j` positions (which is 2), resulting in the binary number `100` (which is 4 in decimal).
- Then, `mask ^ 4` (where `mask` is 3, or `11` in binary) computes the XOR, resulting in `11 ^ 100` which gives `111` (which is 7 in decimal).

Thus, the value being added to `dp[i][mask]` comes from `dp[i - 1][7]`.

However, without specific values for `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][7]`, we cannot determine their exact numeric contributions. But we can state that `dp[i][mask]` is increased by whatever value is present at `dp[i - 1][7]`.

The output state captures the condition of the variables and the operation performed, but does not specify the result of the addition due to the lack of concrete values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][7]`.**
