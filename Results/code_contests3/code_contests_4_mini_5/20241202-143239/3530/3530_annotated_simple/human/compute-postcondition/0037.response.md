The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i][mask]`, which reflects the results based on prior updates, and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, which depends on the previous iteration's results.

Given that `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the condition on `mask` is satisfied (the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero), the operation modifies the `dp` table based on previous computations. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]**
