The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unchanged; it is simply reduced to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. The values of other variables are not directly affected by this operation, but we note that `dp[i][mask]` is now constrained to the range of `0` to `MOD - 1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is the next value less than \(2^n\), `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is the next value less than \(2^n\), `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD.**
