Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp` reflects the final results based on all updates made during the loop iterations for all `i` from 1 to `N`, where `mask` spans all values from 1 to \(2^N - 1\), and for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`, `a[i - 1][j]` influences the values in `dp[i][mask]` based on the condition involving `mask & (1 << j)`.**
