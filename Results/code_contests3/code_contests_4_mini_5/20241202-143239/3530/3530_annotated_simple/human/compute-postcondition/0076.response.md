According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

After this increment, `j` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration.**
