According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 2, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 2**
