Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates based on the conditions met during all iterations of the loop, specifically updating based on the values in `a[i - 1]` and the result of `mask & 1 << j`.**
