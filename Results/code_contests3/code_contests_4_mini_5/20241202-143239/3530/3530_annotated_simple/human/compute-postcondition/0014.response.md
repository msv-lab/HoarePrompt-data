The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `i` is currently `1`, `dp[0][1]` will be set to `1`. The other variables, `N` and `i`, do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive; `i` is 1; `dp[0][0]` is 1; `dp[0][1]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive; `i` is 1; `dp[0][0]` is 1; `dp[0][1]` is 1**
