The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of the affected variables include `dp`, which is a two-dimensional list where `i` and `mask` are indices, and `j` is 2. The operation involves a bitwise XOR with the expression `1 << j`, which means the value at index `mask` is being updated based on the previous state of the dynamic programming table.

Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive and `j` is 2, the value of `1 << j` equals `4`, affecting the mask value. The exact numeric values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]` will depend on their previous states, which are not specified. However, the logic indicates a transition in states based on the indices provided.

The output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is updated, but the specific values depend on the previous state of `dp`. Therefore, the output state must indicate the general operation without specific numeric values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`.**
