Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 0 to `N-1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` will be the sum of its previous value and corresponding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values, taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are never met for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
