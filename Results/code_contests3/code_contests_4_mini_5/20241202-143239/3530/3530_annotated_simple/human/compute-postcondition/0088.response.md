The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

1. The variable `dp[i][mask]` is being modified, and its new value will depend on the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` and the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
2. The `mask ^ 1 << j` operation computes a new mask value where the `j`-th bit of `mask` is toggled.
3. Since the initial state specifies that `j` is less than `n`, the operation is valid, and the value being accessed from the `dp` array is defined.

However, without specific values for `dp`, `i`, `mask`, and `j`, we cannot determine exact numerical changes. We can only determine that the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the state of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state.**
