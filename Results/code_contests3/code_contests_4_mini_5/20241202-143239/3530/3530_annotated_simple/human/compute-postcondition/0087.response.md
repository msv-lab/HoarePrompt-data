According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the condition that `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently less than `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Since `j` is currently less than `n`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` will become equal to `n` after the next increment. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented to `j + 1`. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, `mask` is less than \(2^n - 1\), for the loop to execute a second time `j` will be equal to `n` after incrementing.**
