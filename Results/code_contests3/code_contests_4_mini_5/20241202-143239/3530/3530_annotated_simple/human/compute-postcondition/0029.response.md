According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the current index of the loop, and for it to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, if `j` is currently at its maximum (n - 1), the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. 

If we denote the current value of `j` as `j`, then for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `j`, `j` is incremented by 1.**
