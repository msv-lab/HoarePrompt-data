The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of itself with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is affected by the operation. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged, and the operation does not affect other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD.**
