To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The variable `n` needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once. 
2. The variable `j` which is the loop index will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Currently, we have:
- `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive.
- `dp[0][i]` is set to 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`.
- `i` is `2^N - 1`.
- `mask` is 1.

For the loop to execute:
- We need `n` to be at least 1 for the loop to run.
- Since the loop index `j` starts at 0, it will represent the first iteration of the loop when `j` is equal to 0.

Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and we also have to note that at the first execution of the loop, `j` will be 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`, `i` is `2^N - 1`, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
