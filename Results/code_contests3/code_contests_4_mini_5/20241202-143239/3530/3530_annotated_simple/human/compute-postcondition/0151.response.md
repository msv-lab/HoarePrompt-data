The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `N`, `n`, `mask`, or `j`, but it modifies the value stored in `dp[i][mask]` based on its previous value. The specific previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, so we cannot specify its new value. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the modulo operation has been applied.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`.**
