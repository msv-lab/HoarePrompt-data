According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute for the second time, `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` must be incremented by 1, which means `j` will be 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `2^N - 1`, `i` is `2^N - 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
