Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `dp[i][mask]` reflects the final results based on all updates made during the loop iterations, where `mask` varies from 1 to `2^N - 2`, and for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`, `a[i - 1][j]` influences the values in `dp[i][mask]` based on the condition involving `mask & (1 << j)`.**
