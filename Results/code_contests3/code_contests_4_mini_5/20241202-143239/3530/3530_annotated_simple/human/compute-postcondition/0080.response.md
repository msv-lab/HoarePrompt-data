Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is less than `n`, and `mask` is set to the final value after the last iteration. `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions set in the loop for all iterations, reflecting the final computed values after all iterations of the loop have executed.**
