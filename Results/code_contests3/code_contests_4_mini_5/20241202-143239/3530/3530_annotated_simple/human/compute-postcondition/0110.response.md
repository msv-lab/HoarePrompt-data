Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is equal to the next value (previous `mask` + 1) which is less than \(2^n\), `j` is `n - 1` after all iterations, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions met during the iterations, taken modulo `MOD`.**
