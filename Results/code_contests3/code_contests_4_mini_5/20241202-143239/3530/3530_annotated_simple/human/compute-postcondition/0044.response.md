According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the integer `N`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `k + 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration, `j` will be `k + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `N`, meaning that `N` must be greater than `k + 2`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is `k + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than `k + 2**.
