`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. The variable `i` is 0, so after execution, `dp[0][0]` is set to 1. The value of `N` is not directly affected by this operation, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive; `i` is 0; `dp[0][0]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive; `i` is 0; `dp[0][0]` is 1**
