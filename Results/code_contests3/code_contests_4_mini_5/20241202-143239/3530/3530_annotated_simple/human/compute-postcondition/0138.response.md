According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `n`, which is not possible since `n` is defined as being greater than or equal to 1. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `mask` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be n + 1, which is greater than n.**
