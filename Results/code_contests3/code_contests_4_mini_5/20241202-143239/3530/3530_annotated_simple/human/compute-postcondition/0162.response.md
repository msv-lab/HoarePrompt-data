Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 21) and a 2D list `a` of compatibility data (0 or 1) representing the compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. It calculates the number of perfect matchings using a dynamic programming approach and prints the result. The function does not return any value, but it prints the number of valid pairings based on the input compatibility matrix. The function assumes valid input from the user for `N` and the compatibility matrix.**
