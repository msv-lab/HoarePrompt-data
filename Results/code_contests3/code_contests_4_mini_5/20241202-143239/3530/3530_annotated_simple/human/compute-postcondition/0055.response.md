According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 1 after the next iteration. 

Since `N` is between 1 and 21 inclusive, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 (as `j` will be 1 after increment). 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1**.
