Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 21 inclusive, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `mask` is set to the next value after the first iteration. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulus with `MOD`.***
