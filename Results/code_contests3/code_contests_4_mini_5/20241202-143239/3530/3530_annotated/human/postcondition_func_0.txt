The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers with dimensions N x N, where each element is either 0 or 1. It calculates and prints the number of distinct ways to select a subset of elements from the last row of `a`, subject to specific constraints defined by the values in the 2D list. The result is taken modulo 1000000007. The function does not handle input errors or cases where the input does not meet the expected format.
