You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and a is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions N x N.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from the input; `MOD` is 1000000007.
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from the input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to `(1 << n) - 1`, and `dp` has (n + 1) lists each containing (1 << n) zeros.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `N`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and `dp[N][mask]` contains the sum of valid `dp[N - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values taken modulo `MOD` for all valid `j` where `a[N - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` holds true.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers with dimensions N x N, where each element is either 0 or 1. It calculates and prints the number of distinct ways to select a subset of elements from the last row of `a`, subject to specific constraints defined by the values in the 2D list. The result is taken modulo 1000000007. The function does not handle input errors or cases where the input does not meet the expected format.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
