According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the variable `n` must be at least 1. The state indicates that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, which means `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 1 for the first iteration. Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1 for the first iteration**
