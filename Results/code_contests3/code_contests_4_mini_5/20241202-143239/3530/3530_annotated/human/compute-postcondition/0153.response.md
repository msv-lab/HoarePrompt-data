According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, and since `i` is 3, the loop has executed for `j` values 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Given that `n` is at least 3, `j` can take this new value as long as `n` is greater than 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 3, and `n` must be at least 4 (to ensure that the loop can iterate with `j` equal to 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` must be 3.**
