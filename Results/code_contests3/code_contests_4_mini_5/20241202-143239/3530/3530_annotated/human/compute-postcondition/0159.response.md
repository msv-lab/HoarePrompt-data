Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is `N`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), and `dp[N][mask]` contains the sum of valid `dp[N - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values taken modulo `MOD` for all valid `j` where `a[N - 1][j] == 1` and `mask & 1 << j` holds true.**
