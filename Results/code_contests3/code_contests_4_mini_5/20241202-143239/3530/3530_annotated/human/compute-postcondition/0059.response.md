According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n` and the loop index `j`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and since `i` is currently 1, the next iteration would involve `j` being incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again as `j` (1) is still less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1 and it must satisfy the conditions of `a[i - 1][j]` being 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holding true.**
