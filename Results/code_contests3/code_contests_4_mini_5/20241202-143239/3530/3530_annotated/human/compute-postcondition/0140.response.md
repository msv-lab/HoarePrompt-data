The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` was previously updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][6]`. The exact values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][6]`, and `MOD` are not provided, but we can infer that the operation will affect only `dp[i][mask]` and not any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` is now the result of the modulo operation, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`.**
