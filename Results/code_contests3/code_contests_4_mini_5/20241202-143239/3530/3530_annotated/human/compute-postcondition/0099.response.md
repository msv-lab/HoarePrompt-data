The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given that `mask & 1 << j` is non-zero, it indicates that the bit at position `j` in `mask` is set to 1. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` flips the bit at position `j` in `mask`. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, it allows the transition.

The specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, so we cannot assign specific numbers. However, `dp[i][mask]` is being updated based on the previous state of `dp[i - 1]` and the adjusted mask. 

Thus, the output state reflects the change in `dp[i][mask]` as affected by the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, where `mask` has a bit at position `j` set to 1 and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.**
