The code initializes `a` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered since `a` is being set to a new value. Other variables (`N`, `MOD`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.**
