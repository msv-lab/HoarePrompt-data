According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
