According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[1][2]` is updated to `dp[1][2] % MOD`.**
