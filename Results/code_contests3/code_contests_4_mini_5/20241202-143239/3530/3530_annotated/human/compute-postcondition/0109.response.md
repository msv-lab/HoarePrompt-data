Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), and `j` is 4. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking it modulo `MOD`.***
