Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the result of `mask & 1 << j` is non-zero, indicating that the bit at position `j` in `mask` is set to 1.***
