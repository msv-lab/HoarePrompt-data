Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with a modulo operation using `mask`. If the condition is not satisfied, there are no changes made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
