Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions evaluated for all `j` values from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated accordingly with modulo `MOD`. If no conditions are met for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
