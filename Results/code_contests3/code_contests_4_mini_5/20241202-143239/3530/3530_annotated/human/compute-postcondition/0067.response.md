According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. 

Given that `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute as long as `n` is not less than 1. The variable `j` will start at 0 for the first execution of the loop. 

Since `mask` is stated to start at 1 and the context does not affect `j`, it is not directly relevant to the loop execution. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need the following states:
- `n` must be at least 1 (which is already satisfied)
- `j` is initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
