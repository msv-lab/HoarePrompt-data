According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 2. 

Since `n` is at least 3, it satisfies the condition for executing the loop with `j` being 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 3; `j` is 2; `mask` is 1; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
