According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute a third time, the current value of `j` must be `2` (since the loop starts counting from `0`, the third iteration corresponds to `j = 2`). 

Additionally, we need to ensure that the `mask` is still within the valid range of `2` to \(2^n - 1\) throughout the loop execution.

Given that `i` is already set to `2`, `N` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `n` is at least `1`, we do not need to modify any of these variables for the loop to execute. 

Thus, we can summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute a third time:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the third time**
