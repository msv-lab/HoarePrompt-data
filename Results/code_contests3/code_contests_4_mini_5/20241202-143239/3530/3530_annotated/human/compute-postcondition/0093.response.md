The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. Since this is a modulus operation, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is reduced to its equivalent value in the range of `0` to `MOD-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulus operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD.**
