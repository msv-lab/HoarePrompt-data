The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `i` and `mask` are 3 and 3, respectively. The specific value of `dp[3][3]` is not provided, but it is affected by this modulo operation. The values of the other variables do not change.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3; `dp[3][3]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[3][3]` modulo `MOD`.**
