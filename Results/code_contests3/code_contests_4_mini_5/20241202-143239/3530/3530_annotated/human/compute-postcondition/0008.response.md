The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` appends the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to the list `a`. The `raw_input()` function collects a line of input, and `split()` divides it into separate string components based on whitespace. The `map(int, ...)` converts each of those string components into integers. 

Since the initial state indicates `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, and it also states that for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than `k + 1`, this suggests that the loop might be dependent on the value of `k` but does not directly affect the operation of appending to `a`. 

The exact values of the input are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact contents of the list `a` after this operation. However, the operation is valid, and the list `a` will now contain whatever integers are inputted.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is updated with new integer values from input.**
