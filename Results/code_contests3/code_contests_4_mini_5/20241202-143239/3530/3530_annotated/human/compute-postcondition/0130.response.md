Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, `dp[i][mask]` is the result of the computations based on the conditions of the loop, the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation `mask & 1 << j` is true (indicating that the j-th bit of mask is set)***
