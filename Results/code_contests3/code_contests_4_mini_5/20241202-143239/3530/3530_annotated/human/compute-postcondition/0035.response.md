According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is stated to be at least 1, the loop can execute with the initial state of `j`.

Before the loop starts, the state indicates that `i` is 1 and `mask` is 2. The loop will begin with `j` starting at 0. Given that `j` is initialized to iterate from 0 to `n-1`, it will execute at least once when `n` is 1 or greater.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
