The variable `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The specific values of `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `dp` are not provided, but we know the previous values as follows:

- `i` is 1
- `mask` is 3
- `j` is 1

The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to `3 ^ 2`, which equals `1`. Thus, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value of `dp[i - 1][1]`. 

The values of `dp` are not explicitly given, so we cannot determine specific numerical values, but we note that the update occurs under the conditions provided. Since `dp[i][mask]` is modified, we acknowledge that an update takes place.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][1]` to it, where `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 1**.
