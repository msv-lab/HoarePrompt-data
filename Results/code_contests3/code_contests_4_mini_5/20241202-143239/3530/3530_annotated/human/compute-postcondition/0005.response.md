According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute a total of `N` times, and since it has already executed once, we need to determine the conditions for it to execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. 

Since the loop has already executed once, we can infer that there are now `N - 1` iterations completed. For the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1. Additionally, the loop variable `_` will increment in the next iteration, but as `_` is not used, we don't need to track its value.

Thus, after one iteration, `N` remains unchanged; however, we need to ensure that `N` is still valid for another iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1.**
