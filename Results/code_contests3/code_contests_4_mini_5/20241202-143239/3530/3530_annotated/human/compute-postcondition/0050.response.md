According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting with `j` at 0 on the first iteration. Since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. 

At the start of the loop, the value of `j` will be 0 for the first iteration. For the loop to execute a second time, `mask` must be less than `1 << n`. Given that `mask` is 3, this means:
- `1 << n` equals `2^n`, and for `mask` to be less than `2^n`, `n` needs to be greater than 1 (since `2^1 = 2` and `mask` is 3). 

Thus, to ensure that the loop can execute a second time, we need to ensure `n` is at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0 for the first iteration**.
