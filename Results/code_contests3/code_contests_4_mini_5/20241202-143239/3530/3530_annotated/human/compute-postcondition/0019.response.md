To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop statement and the given state before the loop.

1. The loop condition `for mask in range(1, 1 << n)` indicates that the loop will execute for `mask` values starting from 1 up to `1 << n` (which is equivalent to \(2^n\)).
2. Since `n` is specified to be at least 1, the loop will have a valid execution range.
3. The variable `i` is already set to 1 for the first iteration, which is not directly involved in the loop execution but indicates the iteration count outside the loop.

Given that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 21, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop in this context, but it could be relevant in the loop body or other surrounding code.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `n` should be at least 1 (which is already given).
- The range generated by `1 << n` must be greater than 1, which is satisfied since `n >= 1`.

Assuming `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute, starting with `mask` equal to 1.

Therefore, the necessary states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `mask` starts at 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1**
