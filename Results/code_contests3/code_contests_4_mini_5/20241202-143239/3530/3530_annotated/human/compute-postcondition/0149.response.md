According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute a second time if `j` is incremented to 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1 to 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is satisfied since `n` is at least 3, which allows for `j` to take values up to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1.**
