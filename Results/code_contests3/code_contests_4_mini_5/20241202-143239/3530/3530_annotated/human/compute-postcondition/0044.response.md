According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

After the next iteration, `j` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
