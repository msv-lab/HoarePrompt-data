According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined for `mask`. The loop iterates over `mask` from 1 to `1 << n` (which is `2^n`). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1, and since `n` is at least 3, the next value of `mask` will be 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be incremented to 2. The loop will continue executing as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`, which is `2^n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` allows for further values in the range. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is `n-1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is the result of the computations based on the conditions of the loop.**
