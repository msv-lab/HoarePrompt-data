Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the state of `dp[i][mask]`.***
