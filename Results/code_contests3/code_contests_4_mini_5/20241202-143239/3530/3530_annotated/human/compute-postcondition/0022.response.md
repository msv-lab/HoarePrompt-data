The code snippet updates the `dp` array at the position `[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from the `dp` array at the position `[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given the initial state, the values are:
- `i` is 1
- `mask` is 1
- `j` is 0

The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes as follows:
- `1 << j` (which is `1 << 0`) results in `1`.
- Therefore, `mask ^ 1` results in `1 ^ 1`, which is `0`.

Thus, the code effectively performs the operation:
```
dp[1][1] += dp[0][0]
```

This means that the value of `dp[1][1]` is incremented by the value of `dp[0][0]`. 

The other variables and states are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[1][1]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` which is `dp[1][1] += dp[0][0]`.**
