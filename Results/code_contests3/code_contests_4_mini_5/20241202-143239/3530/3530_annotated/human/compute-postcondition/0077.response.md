The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Given the current values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`, the specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, but we know:

1. `i` is 2.
2. `j` is 2.
3. `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive).

Thus, the output state will describe the change in `dp[i][mask]` based on the operation:

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << 2]` to it.**
