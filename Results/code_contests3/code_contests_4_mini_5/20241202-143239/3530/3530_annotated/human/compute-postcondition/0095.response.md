Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is in the range from 0 to \(n - 1\), and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`, while being taken modulo `MOD`. If any conditions are not met for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged for those iterations.**
