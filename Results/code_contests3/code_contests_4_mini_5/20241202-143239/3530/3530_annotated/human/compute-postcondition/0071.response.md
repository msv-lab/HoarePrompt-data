Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), and `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & \(1 << j\) evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD` after incorporating the previous update from `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Otherwise, no update occurs.***
