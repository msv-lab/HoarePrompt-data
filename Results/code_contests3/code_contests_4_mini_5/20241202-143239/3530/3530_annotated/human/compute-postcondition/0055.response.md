According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. Currently, at the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 after this iteration. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be at least 2, and the updated state will reflect `j` as 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1, if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
