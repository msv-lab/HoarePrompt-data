According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. If `N` is greater than the current iteration count, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. Since the loop iterates `N` times, if it has completed `k` iterations so far, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `k`. 

Assuming the loop has executed `k` times, after the last iteration, `_` would be equal to `k`. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` would be incremented to `k + 1`, and `N` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than `k + 1`**
