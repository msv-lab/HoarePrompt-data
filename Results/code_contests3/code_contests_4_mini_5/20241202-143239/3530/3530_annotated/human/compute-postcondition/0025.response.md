According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is at least 1, `j` can be incremented for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 (since `j` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1.**
