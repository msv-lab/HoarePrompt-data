According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and since `n` is at least 4, the loop can execute for one more iteration when `j` is incremented by 1. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be 4. The other states, such as `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, and the condition involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `dp[i][mask]`, do not need to change since they remain relevant for the loop's context.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), and `j` is 4.**
