The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change `dp[i][mask]` directly but ensures that it stays within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking modulo `MOD`**
