The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, or `j`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is modified by the modulo operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.
