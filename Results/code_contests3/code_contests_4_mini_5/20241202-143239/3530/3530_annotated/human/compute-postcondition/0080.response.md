Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), and `dp[2][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the updates from `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set.**
