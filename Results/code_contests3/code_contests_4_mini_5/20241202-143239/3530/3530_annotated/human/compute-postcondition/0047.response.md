Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `mask` is 2; `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][2]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][6]` and subsequently `dp[i][2]` is updated to `dp[i][2] % MOD`.***
