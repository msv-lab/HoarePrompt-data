According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied in the given state. The loop variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration. 

Since `i` is 1 and `mask` is 1, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The only important variable for the execution of the loop is `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21 (which does not affect loop execution),
- `n` is at least 1 (which is already satisfied),
- `j` will start at 0.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
