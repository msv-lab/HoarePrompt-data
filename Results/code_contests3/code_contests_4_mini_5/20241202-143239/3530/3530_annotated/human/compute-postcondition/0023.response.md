The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. Since `dp[i][mask]` was previously updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, we need to consider that value before applying the modulus.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `dp[i][mask]` or `MOD`, so we cannot define the exact new value of `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the modulus operation has been applied without specifying the value.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`**.
