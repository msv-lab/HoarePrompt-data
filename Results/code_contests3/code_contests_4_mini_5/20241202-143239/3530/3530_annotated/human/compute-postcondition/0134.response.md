According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 for the next iteration.

Since `n` is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be at least 3, and `j` will now represent the second iteration (j = 1).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 3.**
