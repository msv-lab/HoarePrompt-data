`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. Since `i` is initially 0, `dp[0][0]` will be set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from the input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` has (n + 1) lists each containing (1 << n) zeros, `i` is 0, `dp[0][0]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from the input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `dp` has (n + 1) lists each containing (1 << n) zeros, `i` is 0, `dp[0][0]` is 1**
