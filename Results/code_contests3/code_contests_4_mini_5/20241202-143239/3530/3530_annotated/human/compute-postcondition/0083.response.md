Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time and will be 1 for the second execution; the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and \(1 << j\) is non-zero.***
