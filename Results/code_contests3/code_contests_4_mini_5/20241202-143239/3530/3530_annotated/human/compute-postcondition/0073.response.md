The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. In this case, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, so the expression `1 << j` results in `2`, thus `mask ^ (1 << j)` equals `mask ^ 2`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`. 

Since the specific values of `dp` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine exact values for `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]`. However, we can state that the operation modifies `dp[i][mask]` based on the current values in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]` to it, where `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive)**.
