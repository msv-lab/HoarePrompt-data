Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and \(1 << j\) is true (i.e., `mask` has the j-th bit set).***
