The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified in the initial state, but it is implied that it has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]`. Therefore, this operation will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
