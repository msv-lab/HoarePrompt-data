Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & 1 << j is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the state of the program.***
