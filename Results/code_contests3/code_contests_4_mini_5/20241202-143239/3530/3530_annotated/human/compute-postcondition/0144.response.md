According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `j = 0` and ending at `j = n - 1`. Given that `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Additionally, the state of `i` and `mask` before the loop does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it is important to note that `i` is set to 3 and `mask` is 3 at the start. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `j` should start at 0, and `n` is confirmed to be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
