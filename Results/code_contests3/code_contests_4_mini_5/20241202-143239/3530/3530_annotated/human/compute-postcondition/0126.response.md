Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 3; `j` is 2; `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taken modulo `MOD`, resulting in `dp[i][mask]` being updated accordingly.***
