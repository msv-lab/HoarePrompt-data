The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions N x N. 

The function does not return any specific value as described in the output, hence it may perform an operation without a return statement. Without additional context for the output, we cannot specify the return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (dimensions N x N) where each element is either 0 or 1.**
