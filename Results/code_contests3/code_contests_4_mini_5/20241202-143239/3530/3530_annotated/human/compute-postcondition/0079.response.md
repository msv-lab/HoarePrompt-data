Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking it modulo `MOD`, while `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << 2]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no update to the `dp` array.***
