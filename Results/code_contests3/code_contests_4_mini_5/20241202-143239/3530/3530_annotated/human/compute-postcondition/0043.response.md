Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[1][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][0]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
