The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The specifics of the values depend on the current values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`.

1. The variable `i` is currently 1.
2. The variable `mask` is currently 1.
3. The variable `j` is currently 2.
4. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask value. Since `mask` is 1 (binary `01`) and `1 << j` shifts 1 left by 2 places, giving `4` (binary `100`), the XOR operation will yield `mask ^ 4` which results in `5` (binary `101`).

Thus, the operation can be interpreted as:
- The value of `dp[1][1]` is updated by adding `dp[0][5]` to it.

The variable `dp[i][mask]` is affected, while `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is accessed to compute the new value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[0][5]` to it.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[0][5]` to it.**
