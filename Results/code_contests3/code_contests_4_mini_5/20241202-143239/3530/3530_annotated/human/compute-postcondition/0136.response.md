The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder after dividing it by `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i][mask]` but we know that it will remain non-negative and will be less than `MOD`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking the remainder with `MOD`.
