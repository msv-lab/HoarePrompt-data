According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.**
