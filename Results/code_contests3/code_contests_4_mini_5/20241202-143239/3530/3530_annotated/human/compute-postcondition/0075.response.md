Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (inclusive), and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.***
