Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`; `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions checked for each `j` in the range of `n`, where `dp[i][mask]` is the sum of valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values, taken modulo `MOD`.**
