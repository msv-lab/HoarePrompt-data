The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value and performing a modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous state indicates that `dp[i][mask]` has already been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][1]` to it. Since `mask` is 3, we are specifically modifying `dp[i][3]`.

This operation does not change the values of `dp[i - 1][1]`, `i`, or `mask`, but it affects the value of `dp[i][3]` by ensuring it falls within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][3]` has been modified with the modulo operation, but the exact numeric values of the variables are not specified.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo operation, where `mask` is 3.**
