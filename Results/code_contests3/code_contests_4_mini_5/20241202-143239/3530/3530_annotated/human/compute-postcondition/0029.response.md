According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute two times in total for `j = 0` and `j = 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. However, since `j` is now 2, it is important to note that this is outside the valid range for `j` because `j` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must remain within the range of valid indices, meaning that `n` must be greater than 2 (which it is, since `n` is at least 2). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2; for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
