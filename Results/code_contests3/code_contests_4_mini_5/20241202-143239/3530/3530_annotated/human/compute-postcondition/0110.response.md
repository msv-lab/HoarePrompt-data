Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `mask` is in the range from 2 to \(2^n - 1\), and `j` has iterated through all values from 0 to \(n-1\). If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the corresponding values of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and the final value of `dp[i][mask]` will be taken modulo `MOD`.**
