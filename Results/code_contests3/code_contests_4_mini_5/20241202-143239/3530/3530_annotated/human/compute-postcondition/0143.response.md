According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mask`. The loop iterates over values of `mask` that start from 1 up to `1 << n` (which is 2 raised to the power of `n`). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be incremented to the next value, which would be 3.

Given that `n` is at least 3, the value of `mask` can still be increased, as `1 << n` will be at least 8 (when `n` is 3). Thus, for the loop to execute again, `mask` must be 3 and the loop can continue as long as it is less than `1 << n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `j` from 0 to `n-1`.**
