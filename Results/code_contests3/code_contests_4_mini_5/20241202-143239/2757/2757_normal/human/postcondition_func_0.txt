The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns True if `ch` is a consonant (not a vowel), and False if `ch` is a vowel. It does not handle cases for strings of length greater than one or any characters that are not lowercase English letters, which may lead to unexpected behavior if those cases are encountered.
