Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails to do so:

1. **Input Format Handling**: The program expects input of type `float`, but the problem description specifies that the input should be in the form of an arithmetic expression "(a+b)/c", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. The program does not parse this format; instead, it attempts to read a float directly, which is not aligned with the expected input structure.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The code does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions provided as input. The correct procedure would involve parsing the input string, extracting the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, performing the arithmetic operation `(a + b) / c`, and storing the resulting value. The current implementation simply attempts to convert the input to a float without any parsing or computation, which means it will not produce the correct jump coordinates.

3. **Counting Occurrences of Coordinates**: While the program correctly counts occurrences of values in a list, it operates on the incorrect assumption that the input values are already float coordinates. Since the input format is not processed, the counts will not reflect the actual jump coordinates of the ships as described in the problem.

4. **Output Format**: The output should list the number of ships that will end up at the same coordinate after the jump. However, since the input is not handled correctly, the output will not represent the counts of the actual jump coordinates.

In summary, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to the lack of proper input handling, evaluation of the arithmetic expressions, and correct counting of occurrences of the computed coordinates. Therefore, the correctness of the program is false.
