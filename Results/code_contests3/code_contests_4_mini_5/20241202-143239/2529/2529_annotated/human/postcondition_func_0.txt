The function accepts a positive integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) as input, then reads `m` float values from user input and counts the occurrences of each float value in the list. Finally, it prints the counts of occurrences for each float in the same order as they were inputted. However, it does not process or validate any ship jump coordinates formatted as "(a+b)/c", which are mentioned in the annotations but not actually handled in the code.
