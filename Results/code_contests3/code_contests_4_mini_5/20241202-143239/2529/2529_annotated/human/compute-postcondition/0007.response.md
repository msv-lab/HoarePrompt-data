The variable `test_list` is appended with the value of `e`. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `i` is 1; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the value of `e**.
