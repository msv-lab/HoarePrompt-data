According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 1**.
