The code appends to `my_list` the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The value of `i` is the third element of `test_list`, and `my_list` already includes the count of occurrences of the second element in `test_list`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and `my_list` is updated with the new count.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `test_list` contains at least 3 float elements; `i` is the third element of `test_list`; `my_list` now includes the count of occurrences of the second element in `test_list` and the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` has been appended to `my_list`.**
