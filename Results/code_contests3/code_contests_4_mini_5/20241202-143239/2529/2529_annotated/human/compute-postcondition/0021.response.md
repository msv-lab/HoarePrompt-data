The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes input pertaining to ship jump coordinates, which are given as strings in the format "(a+b)/c", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. The function's output is determined based on these ship jump coordinates. 

Based on the provided constraints and output, the functionality of the function is to accept ship jump coordinates in the specified string format and perform calculations or checks as needed. However, since no specific return cases are detailed in the output, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes ship jump coordinates given as strings in the format "(a+b)/c", where a, b, and c are positive integers, performing calculations based on these coordinates.**
