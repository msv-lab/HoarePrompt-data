According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `test_list`. Since `i` is currently the first element of `test_list`, the loop will proceed to the next element on the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element of `test_list`, which means there is at least one element remaining in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `test_list` must contain at least 2 elements, and `i` must be updated to the second element of `test_list`. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000], `test_list` contains at least 2 float elements, `i` is the second element of `test_list`, and `my_list` now includes the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`.**
