The code initializes an empty list called `my_list`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, or `test_list`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` float elements that were inputted by the user; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` float elements that were inputted by the user; `my_list` is an empty list.**
