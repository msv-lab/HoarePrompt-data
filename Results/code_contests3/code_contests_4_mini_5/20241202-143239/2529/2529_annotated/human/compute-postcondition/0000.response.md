The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` will accept an input representing a positive integer. The initial state indicates that `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `m` is now assigned a new value based on user input while remaining a positive integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer based on user input in the range [1, 200000]**
