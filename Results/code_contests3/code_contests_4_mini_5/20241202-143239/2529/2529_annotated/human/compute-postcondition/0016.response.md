`my_list` is updated by appending the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. Since `i` is the second element of `test_list`, the count reflects how many times that specific float appears in the list. The previous values of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, 200000]; `test_list` contains at least 2 float elements; `i` is the second element of `test_list`; `my_list` now includes the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`.
