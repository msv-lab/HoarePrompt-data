Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly parse the input expressions of the form `(a+b)/c` as described in the problem statement. Instead, it incorrectly attempts to read the input directly as a float, which will not work for the string format of the expressions. 

For instance, if the input is:

```
1
(99+98)/97
```

The program will raise a `ValueError` when it tries to convert `(99+98)/97` directly into a float. This indicates that the program does not handle the input format described in the problem correctly.

Additionally, the program does not compute the actual arithmetic value of the expressions but rather attempts to count how many times the string representation of the expressions appears in the input list, which is not the requirement of the problem.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements and is deemed incorrect.
