The provided code does not adhere to the problem description. The problem specifies that the input consists of arithmetic expressions in the form of "(a+b)/c", but the code reads floating-point numbers directly from the input without parsing the arithmetic expressions. As a result, it does not handle the required input format and will fail to produce the correct output based on the described problem.

Additionally, the output hints indicate that the function simply counts occurrences of floating-point numbers, which further confirms that the code does not implement the necessary logic to evaluate the expressions and count the ships based on the final coordinates.

There are multiple edge cases that the code fails to consider, such as:

1. The code does not parse the input correctly, meaning it cannot handle cases where the arithmetic expressions involve different values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. It will fail entirely if the input is in the expected format "(a+b)/c" because it would attempt to convert that string directly to a float, leading to a ValueError.

Given these issues, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
