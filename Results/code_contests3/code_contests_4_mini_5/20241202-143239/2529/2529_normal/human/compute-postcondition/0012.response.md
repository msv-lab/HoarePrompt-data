`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `m` and `test_list` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is between 1 and 200000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; `my_list` is an empty list**
