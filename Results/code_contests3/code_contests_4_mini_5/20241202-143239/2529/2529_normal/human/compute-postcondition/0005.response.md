According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `m`. Since `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is between 1 and 200000. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1.

State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
