According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is between 1 and 200000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. Since `m` is greater than 1 (as `i` must be less than `m` for the loop to continue), for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
