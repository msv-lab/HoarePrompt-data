`test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 200000. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `test_list` is an empty list**
