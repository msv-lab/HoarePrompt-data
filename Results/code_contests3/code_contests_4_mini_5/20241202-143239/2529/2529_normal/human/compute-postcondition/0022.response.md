Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000), and then it reads `m` floating-point numbers from input, storing them in a list called `test_list`. It counts the occurrences of each floating-point number in `test_list` and stores these counts in another list called `my_list`. Finally, it prints the counts of each number in `my_list` as a space-separated string. The function does not handle the input format "(a+b)/c" stated in the annotations and focuses solely on counting the occurrences of the floating-point numbers provided. **
