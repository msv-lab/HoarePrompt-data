According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, which it is since `m` is stated to be between 1 and 200000. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as this is the starting index for the range in Python. The `test_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop does not rely on the contents of `test_list`. 

State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
