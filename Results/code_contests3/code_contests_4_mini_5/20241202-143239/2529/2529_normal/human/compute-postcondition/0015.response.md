According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` contains more floating-point numbers, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first floating-point number in `test_list`. After the current iteration, `i` will be updated to the next floating-point number in `test_list`. For the loop to execute again, the `test_list` must contain at least 2 floating-point numbers.

State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `test_list` contains at least 2 floating-point numbers, `i` is the second floating-point number in `test_list`, `my_list` contains the count of the first floating-point number in `test_list`**
