The variable `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `m` is an integer between 1 and 200000, and its value will depend on the user input.

Output State: **`m` is an integer between 1 and 200000; its exact value is the input integer.**
