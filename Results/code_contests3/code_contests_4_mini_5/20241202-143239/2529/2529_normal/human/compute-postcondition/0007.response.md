The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged and is still between 1 and 200000, while `i` is still 1. The value of `e` is an input float that is being added to `test_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 1, and `e` has been appended to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 1, and `e` has been appended to `test_list.**
