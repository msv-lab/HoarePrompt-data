According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `test_list`. Since `m` is between 1 and 200000, `test_list` will contain at least 1 floating-point number. Therefore, the loop can execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `my_list` is empty, but that does not affect the execution of the loop. The variable `i` will take the value of the first floating-point number in `test_list` during the first iteration.

So, for the loop to execute the first time, `test_list` must contain at least 1 floating-point number, and initially, `i` will be the first element of `test_list`.

State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `test_list` contains at least 1 floating-point number, `i` is the first floating-point number in `test_list`, `my_list` is empty**
