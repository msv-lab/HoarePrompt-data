The loop iterates through each unique floating-point number in `test_list`, appending the count of that number in `test_list` to `my_list`. After all iterations are complete, `my_list` will contain the count of each floating-point number present in `test_list`, resulting in a list that reflects the frequency of each number. Since `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, `my_list` will have a length equal to `m` after all iterations.

Output State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, `i` is each floating-point number in `test_list` during the iterations, `my_list` contains the counts of each floating-point number in `test_list`.**
