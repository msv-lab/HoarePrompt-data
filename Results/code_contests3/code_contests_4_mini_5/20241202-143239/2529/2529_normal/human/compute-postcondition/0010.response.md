In this case, the code appends the value of `e` (which is a floating-point number from input) to `test_list`. The value of `m` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of `m` and `i`, along with the action of appending `e` to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number from input, and `e` is appended to `test_list`.**
