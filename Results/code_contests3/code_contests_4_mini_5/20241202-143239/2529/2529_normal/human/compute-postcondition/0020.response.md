The code provided uses the `print` function to output a string that joins the elements of `my_list`, converted to strings. The values of `my_list` will be printed as a single line of space-separated values. 

Since `my_list` contains the counts of each floating-point number in `test_list`, the output will depend on the contents of `my_list`.

The values of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` do not change during this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the action of printing `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is between 1 and 200000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; `i` is each floating-point number in `test_list` during the iterations; `my_list` contains the counts of each floating-point number in `test_list`, and we print the counts from `my_list` as a space-separated string.**
