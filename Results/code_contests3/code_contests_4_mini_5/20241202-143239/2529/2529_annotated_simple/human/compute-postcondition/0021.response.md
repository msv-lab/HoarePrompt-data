The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a series of arithmetic expressions in the form of (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. After executing the function body and evaluating each expression, the function returns the results of these calculations. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate a series of valid arithmetic expressions and return their calculated results. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns the results of evaluating a series of valid arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c.**
