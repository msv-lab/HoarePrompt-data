The code appends the count of the value `i` (which is the third element of `test_list`) in `test_list` to `my_list`. The values of `m` and `test_list` are not directly affected by this operation, but the value of `my_list` is updated.

Since `i` is already defined as the third element of `test_list`, after executing the code, `my_list` will contain an additional element representing how many times `i` appears in `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 200000; `test_list` contains at least 3 float values; `i` is the third element of `test_list`; `my_list` is updated with the count of `i` in `test_list.**
