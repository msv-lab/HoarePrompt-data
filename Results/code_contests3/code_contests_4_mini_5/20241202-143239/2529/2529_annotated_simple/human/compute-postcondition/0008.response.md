According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `m` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 200000, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**
