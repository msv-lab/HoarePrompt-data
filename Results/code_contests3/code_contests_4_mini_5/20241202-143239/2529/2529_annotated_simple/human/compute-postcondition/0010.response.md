The value of `e` is appended to `test_list`. The previous states of the other variables (`m` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `e` is a float input from the user, and `e` has been added to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `e` is a float input from the user, and `e` has been added to `test_list.**
