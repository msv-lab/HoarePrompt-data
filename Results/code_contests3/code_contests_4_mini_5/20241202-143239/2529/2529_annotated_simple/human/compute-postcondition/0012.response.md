The variable `my_list` is initialized as an empty list. This action does not affect any other variables, and the previous values of `m`, `i`, and `test_list` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 200000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` float values input from the user; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 200000; `i` is `m - 1`; `test_list` contains `m` float values input from the user; `my_list` is an empty list.**
