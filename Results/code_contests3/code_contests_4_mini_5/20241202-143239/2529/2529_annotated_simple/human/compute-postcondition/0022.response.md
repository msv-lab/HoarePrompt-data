Functionality: ** The function accepts input from the user, where the first line indicates the number of subsequent arithmetic expressions (m), and the following m lines contain floating-point numbers. It counts the occurrences of each floating-point number from the input and prints these counts as a space-separated string. It does not perform any arithmetic calculations based on the input expressions, despite the initial comments suggesting it does. **
