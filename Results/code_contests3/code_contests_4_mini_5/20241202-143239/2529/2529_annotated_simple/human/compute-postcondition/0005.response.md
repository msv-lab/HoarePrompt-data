According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `m` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 200000, we can deduce that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.

For the loop to execute again, `m` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` will now be 1). 

State: **`m` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 200000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
