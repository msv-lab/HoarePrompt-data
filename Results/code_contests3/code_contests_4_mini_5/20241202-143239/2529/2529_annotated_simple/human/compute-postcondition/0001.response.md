The code initializes `test_list` as an empty list. The variable `m` remains unchanged, as the code does not affect its value or state. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer that has been reassigned from input within the range 1 to 200000; `test_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer that has been reassigned from input within the range 1 to 200000; `test_list` is an empty list**.
