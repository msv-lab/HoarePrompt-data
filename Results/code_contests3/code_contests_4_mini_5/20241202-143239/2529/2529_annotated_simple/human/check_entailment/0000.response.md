The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program attempts to read the arithmetic expressions directly as floats:
   ```python
   e = float(input())
   ```
   This is incorrect because the input is in the form of a string representing an arithmetic expression (e.g., "(99+98)/97"), not a float. The program should be parsing this string to compute the value of the expression instead of converting it directly to a float.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program does not evaluate the arithmetic expression. It merely collects the input and attempts to count occurrences of the float values directly:
   ```python
   my_list.append(test_list.count(i))
   ```
   Since the input is not evaluated, the counts will not represent the number of ships that end up at the same coordinate after the jump.

3. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The counting logic does not account for the actual values derived from the arithmetic expressions. The correct approach would involve evaluating each expression and then counting how many ships jump to the same evaluated coordinate.

### Example of Failure:

Consider the input:
```
4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7
```
- The expected output is `1 2 2 1`, as ships 2 and 3 end up at the same coordinate (3).
- However, due to the lack of expression evaluation, the program would fail to correctly determine the values of the expressions, leading to incorrect counts.

### Conclusion:

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, as it does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions correctly, resulting in incorrect counting of the ships' coordinates.

Correctness: **False**
