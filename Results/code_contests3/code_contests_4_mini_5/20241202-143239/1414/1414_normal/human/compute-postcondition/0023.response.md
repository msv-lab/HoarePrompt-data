Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is modified to `a - k * v`, `b` is decreased by `k - 1`, and `res` is 2. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is less than its original value and `b` is equal to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` remains greater than 0 after being decremented by `v`, `b` is greater than or equal to 0, and `res` is 2.***
