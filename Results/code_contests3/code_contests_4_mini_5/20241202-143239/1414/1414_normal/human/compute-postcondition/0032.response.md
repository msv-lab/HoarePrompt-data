Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `k` â‰¤ 1000; if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1). If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is 0, `res` is increased by 1 and `a` is decreased by `v`.***
