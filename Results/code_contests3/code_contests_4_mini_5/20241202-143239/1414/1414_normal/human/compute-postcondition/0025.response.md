The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but its value will increase by 1. The other variables `a`, `b`, `k`, and `v` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1**
