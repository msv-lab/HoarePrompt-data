The value of `res` is incremented by 1, and since `res` was initially 1, it becomes 2 after execution. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a positive integer, `res` is 2.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is greater than or equal to 0, `v` is a positive integer, `res` is 2**
