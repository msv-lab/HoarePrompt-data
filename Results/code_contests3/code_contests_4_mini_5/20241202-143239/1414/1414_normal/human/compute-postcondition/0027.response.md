The variable `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. Since `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, the value of `(k - 1)` will range from 1 to 999. The previous value of `b` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact value after the operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` has been decreased by `(k - 1)`, while the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `res` is increased by 1; `a` is decreased by `k * v`; `b` is decreased by (k - 1)**
