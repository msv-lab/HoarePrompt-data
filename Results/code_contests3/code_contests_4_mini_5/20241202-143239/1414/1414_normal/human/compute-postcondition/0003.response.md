`res` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, the new value of `res` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ `a` ≤ 1000), `b` is a positive integer representing the number of divisors (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 1000), `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000), `res` is 1.
