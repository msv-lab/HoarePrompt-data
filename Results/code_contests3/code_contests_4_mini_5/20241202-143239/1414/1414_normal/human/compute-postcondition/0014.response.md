Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `k` â‰¤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` remains 1. Otherwise, if `b` > 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` remains 1; if `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains less than `k` and equal to 0, `v` is a positive integer, and `res` is still 1.***
