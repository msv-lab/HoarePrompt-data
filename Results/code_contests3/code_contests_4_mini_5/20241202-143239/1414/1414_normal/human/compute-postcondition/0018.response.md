The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `(k - 1)` will be at least 1 and at most 999. This means `b` will be reduced by a positive amount, but since `b` is initially greater than or equal to 0, we need to ensure that `b` remains non-negative after this operation. The states of other variables `a`, `v`, and `res` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is between 2 and 1000; `a` is greater than 0 and modified to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `v` is a positive integer; `res` is 2.

Output State: **`k` is between 2 and 1000; `a` is greater than 0 and modified to `a - k * v`; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `v` is a positive integer; `res` is 2**
