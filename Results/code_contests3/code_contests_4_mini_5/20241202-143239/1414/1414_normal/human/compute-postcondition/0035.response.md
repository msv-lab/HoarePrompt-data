The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as described in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints mentioned, it seems that the function operates within the context of the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, which have the following characteristics:

- `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 1000 \).
- `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts, constrained by \( 1 \leq a \leq 1000 \).
- `b` is a positive integer representing the number of divisors, constrained by \( 1 \leq b \leq 1000 \).
- `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box, constrained by \( 1 \leq v \leq 1000 \).

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, but it presumably computes and returns some value based on the relationships and constraints of the parameters defined. Without additional specific output information, we cannot detail exact return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, and it is expected to compute a result based on the integer k, the positive integers a, b, and v, following their respective constraints. The specific output behavior is not detailed.**
