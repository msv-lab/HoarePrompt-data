The function accepts no parameters directly but reads four integers from input: an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), a positive integer `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, a positive integer `b` (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and a positive integer `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box. The function calculates how many iterations it takes to reduce `a` to 0 or below by decrementing `a` based on the values of `b` and `k` in a loop. The iterations count is printed as the result. The function does not handle cases where input values fall outside of the specified ranges, nor does it check for invalid input formats.
