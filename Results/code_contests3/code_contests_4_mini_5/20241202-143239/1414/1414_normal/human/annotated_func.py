#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, a is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), b is a positive integer representing the number of divisors (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and v is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is equal to the number of iterations it took to reduce `a` to 0 or below, where during each iteration `a` was decreased by either `k * v`, `(b + 1) * v`, or `v` depending on the value of `b`.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters directly but reads four integers from input: an integer `k` (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), a positive integer `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, a positive integer `b` (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and a positive integer `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box. The function calculates how many iterations it takes to reduce `a` to 0 or below by decrementing `a` based on the values of `b` and `k` in a loop. The iterations count is printed as the result. The function does not handle cases where input values fall outside of the specified ranges, nor does it check for invalid input formats.
