Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `k` â‰¤ 1000, `b` is a positive integer, `a` is greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v, which is effectively `v`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
