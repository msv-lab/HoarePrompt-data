The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, this operation will result in `b` being reduced but remaining a non-negative integer. The values of `a`, `v`, and `res` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to `a - (k * v)`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box, `res` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - (k * v)`; `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`; `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box; `res` is 1**.
