The value of `a` is decremented by `v`, but the previous value of `a` and `v` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `a`. The state of `b` and `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is decreased by `v`; `b` is a positive integer; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is decreased by `v`; `b` is a positive integer; `res` is increased by 1.**
