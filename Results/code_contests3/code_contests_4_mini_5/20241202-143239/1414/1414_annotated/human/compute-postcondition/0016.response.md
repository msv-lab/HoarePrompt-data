The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact new value. However, since `k` is an integer within the range of 2 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers, the conditions for the loop to execute again remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are positive integers; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are positive integers; `res` is increased by 1.**
