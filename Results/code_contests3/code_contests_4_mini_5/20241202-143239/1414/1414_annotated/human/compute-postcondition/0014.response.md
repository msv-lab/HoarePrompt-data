Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are positive integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (k * v)`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box, and `res` is 1. If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0; if `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v` while `b` remains 0, with `v` still being a positive integer and `res` remaining 1.***
