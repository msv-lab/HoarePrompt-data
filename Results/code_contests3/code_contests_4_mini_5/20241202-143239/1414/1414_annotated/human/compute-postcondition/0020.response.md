`b` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `b` was a positive integer, but now it is set to `0`, which means it no longer holds a positive value. The values of `k`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`; `b` is 0; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`; `b` is 0; `res` is increased by 1.**
