The value of `a` is updated by subtracting `(b + 1) * v` from its previous value. The values of `b`, `k`, and `res` are not affected by this operation. Since `a` is a positive integer, the new value of `a` will depend on the specific values of `b` and `v`. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`; `b` is a positive integer; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`; `b` is a positive integer; `res` is increased by 1.**
