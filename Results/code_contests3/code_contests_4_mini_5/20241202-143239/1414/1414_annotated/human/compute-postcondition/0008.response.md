Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is a positive integer greater than 0; `b` is a positive integer representing the number of divisors that is less than `k` (1 ≤ `b` < `k` ≤ 1000); `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ `v` ≤ 1000); `res` is 1; and `b` is greater than 0.***
