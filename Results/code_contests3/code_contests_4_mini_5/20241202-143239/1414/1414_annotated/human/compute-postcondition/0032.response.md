Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `k` â‰¤ 1000, `b` is a positive integer, and `a` is greater than 0. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than `k`, then `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, which is effectively `v`, and `res` is increased by 1.***
