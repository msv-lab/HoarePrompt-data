The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`. Since `b` is a positive integer, this operation will reduce its value, but we do not know the exact value of `b` before the operation. The other variables (`k`, `a`, `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is modified to `a - k * v`; `res` is increased by 1; `b` is decreased by (k - 1).

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is modified to `a - k * v`; `res` is increased by 1; `b` is decreased by (k - 1)**
