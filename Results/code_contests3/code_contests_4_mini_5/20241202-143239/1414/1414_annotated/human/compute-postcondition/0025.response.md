The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`k`, `b`, and `a`) remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `b` is a positive integer, `a` must be greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000, `b` is a positive integer, `a` must be greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1.**
