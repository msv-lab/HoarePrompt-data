#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, a is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), b is a positive integer representing the number of divisors (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and v is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, and `k` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, where `k` is the number of sections that can hold nuts, `a` is the total number of nuts, `b` is the maximum number of divisors available, and `v` is the capacity of each section. The function calculates how many iterations it takes to distribute all the nuts into sections, considering the available divisors and the capacity of each section. It continues until all nuts are distributed (when `a` is less than or equal to 0) and prints the total number of iterations. However, there is no explicit return value; the output is printed directly.
