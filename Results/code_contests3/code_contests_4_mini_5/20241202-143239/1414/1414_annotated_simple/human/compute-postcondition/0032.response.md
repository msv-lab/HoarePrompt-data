Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers where `k` is between 2 and 1000. If `b >= k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` has been incremented by 2. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0 if it was greater than 0, or `a` is decreased by `v` while `b` remains unchanged if `b` is less than or equal to 0, and in both cases, `res` has been incremented by 2.***
