Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `v` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `res` has been incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decremented by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by (k - 1), and `res` is incremented by 1. If `b` is less than `k`, then `a` is updated; if `b` is greater than 0, then `b` is set to 0 and `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a` is decremented by `v`, `b` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `v` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `res` is incremented by 1.***
