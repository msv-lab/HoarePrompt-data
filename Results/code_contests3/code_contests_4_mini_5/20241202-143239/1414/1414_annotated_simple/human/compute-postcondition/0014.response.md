Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, and `res` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than `k` and greater than 0, then `a` is updated to a new value, `b` becomes 0, and `v` remains unchanged with `res` still as 1. If `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, and `res` is 1.***
