The value of `a` is decreased by `v`. Since `a` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and `v` is also an integer between 1 and 1000, the new value of `a` will be `a - v`. The value of `b` is not affected as it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is `a - v`, `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), `res` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is `a - v`, `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000), `res` is 1**
