#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the number of times the loop executed, and `k`, `v` remain unchanged as integers within their respective ranges.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, and calculates how many iterations are required to reduce `a` to zero or less by decrementing it based on the conditions of `b` and `k`, finally printing the total number of iterations. If `a` starts at zero or less, it will print `0` without entering the loop.
