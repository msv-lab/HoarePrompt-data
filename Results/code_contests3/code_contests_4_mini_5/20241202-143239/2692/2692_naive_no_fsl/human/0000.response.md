Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not check if the ticket number consists exclusively of the lucky digits (4 and 7). For example, consider the input:

```
4
1234
```

In this case, the ticket number `1234` has digits other than 4 and 7. According to the problem description, a lucky ticket must contain only the digits 4 and 7; therefore, this ticket should not be classified as lucky. However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because the sums of the halves are not equal (1+2 â‰  3+4), without even checking if the digits are lucky.

Thus, the program does not fulfill all the requirements of the problem description, leading to an incorrect classification of tickets.
