Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string input representing a `ticket_number` consisting of exactly `n` digits, which can only be 4 or 7. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input does not conform to the expected format, such as non-digit characters or incorrect lengths, which could lead to runtime errors. **
