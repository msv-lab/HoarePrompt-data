Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is a map of integers from the stripped input. The sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` (from index 0 to `n / 2 - 1`) is equal to the sum of the second half of the elements in `digits` (from index `n / 2 + n % 2` to `n - 1`).***
