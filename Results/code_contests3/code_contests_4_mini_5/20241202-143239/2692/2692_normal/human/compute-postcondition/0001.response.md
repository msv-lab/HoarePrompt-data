The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, which means it is now set to an input integer. The previous conditions state that `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 50. However, the program does not change the value of the ticket number or any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input (even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50)**
