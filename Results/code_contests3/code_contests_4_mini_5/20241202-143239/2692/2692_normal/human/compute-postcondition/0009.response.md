The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket_number`. The parameter `n` is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). The parameter `ticket_number` is a positive integer represented as a string with exactly `n` digits, containing only the digits 4 and 7. The function's output is not explicitly described in the provided information. Therefore, without additional context about the return values based on the input parameters, we can't specify the exact functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a `ticket_number` (a string of exactly `n` digits consisting only of the digits 4 and 7).**
