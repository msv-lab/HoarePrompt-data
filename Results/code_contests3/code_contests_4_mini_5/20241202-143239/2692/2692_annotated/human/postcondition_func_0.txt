The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and reads a ticket number represented as a string of length `n`, which contains only the digits 4 and 7. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input is not as specified (for example, if `n` is odd or outside the specified range, or if the ticket number contains digits other than 4 and 7).
