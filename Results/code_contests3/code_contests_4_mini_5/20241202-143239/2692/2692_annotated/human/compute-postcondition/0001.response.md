The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input().strip()`, which reads a line of input, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and then converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as an even integer within the specified range (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50), its value will now be the integer input received from the user. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer obtained from input, and the ticket number is a string of length exactly `n`, containing only the digits 4 and 7.**
