The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). Additionally, it expects a ticket number that is a positive integer represented as a string of length exactly \(n\), containing only the digits 4 and 7. The function evaluates the ticket number based on these criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` within the range of 2 to 50, and a ticket number as a string of length `n`, containing only the digits 4 and 7.**
