Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not adequately check whether the ticket number consists solely of lucky digits (4 and 7). According to the problem description, a ticket number is considered lucky only if it is entirely composed of the digits 4 and 7. However, the program simply reads the ticket number as a string of digits and maps them to integers without verifying if they are all lucky digits. 

Additionally, there is an issue with how the second half of the digits is accessed in the sum calculation. The expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` incorrectly includes one extra digit from the second half when `n` is even, which should not be the case.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, specifically the requirement to ensure all digits are lucky and the incorrect calculation of the second half's sum.
