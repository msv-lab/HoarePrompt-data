To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

The program is supposed to:
1. Check if the ticket number is a lucky number, meaning it should consist only of the digits 4 and 7.
2. Check if the sum of the digits in the first half of the ticket equals the sum of the digits in the second half.

Let's look at the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
    digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())
    if sum(digits[:n / 2]) == sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if all digits of the ticket number are either 4 or 7. This is a critical part of determining if the ticket is lucky. For example, if the input is `4738`, the program would incorrectly return "NO" without verifying that `4738` contains digits other than 4 and 7.

2. **Slicing Logic**: The slicing in the condition `sum(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:])` is incorrect because it should be `sum(digits[n / 2:])`. The `n % 2` part is unnecessary and incorrect for even lengths.

3. **Input Handling**: The `map(int, raw_input().strip())` will not correctly handle the input as a list of digits because it needs to split the string into individual characters first, or alternatively, it should convert the input to a string and then map it to integers.

### Test Cases that Fail:

- For an input of `4` and `4738`, the expected behavior is to first check if `4738` is a lucky number (it is not, due to the presence of digit `3` and `8`), which the program fails to do.
- For an input of `4` and `4747`, the program would incorrectly evaluate the sums without checking if all digits are lucky.

### Conclusion:

Given the identified issues, particularly the lack of a check for lucky digits and the incorrect slicing logic, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
