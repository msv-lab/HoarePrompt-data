Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program fails to check if the ticket number consists only of the lucky digits (4 and 7). According to the problem description, a ticket number must be a lucky number, meaning it should contain only the digits 4 and 7. The program does not include any logic to verify this condition.

2. **Incorrect Indexing**: The program uses `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` to sum the second half of the digits. This is incorrect because it effectively skips the middle digit if `n` is even (which it always is, according to the problem statement). The correct slicing should be `digits[n / 2:]` to get the second half of the digits.

3. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` and `map(int, ...)`, which may not correctly handle the input as expected. The ticket number should be treated as a string and checked for lucky digits before converting to integers for summation.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The program does not ensure that both halves of the ticket number are being compared correctly after checking for lucky digits.

Because of these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, particularly regarding the verification of lucky digits and the correct summation of both halves of the ticket number. Thus, it is not a correct implementation of the specified functionality.
