Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (between 2 and 50) and reads a ticket number represented as a string of digits (either 4 or 7) of length `n`. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle invalid inputs or ensure that the digits are only 4 and 7, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not meet these criteria. **
