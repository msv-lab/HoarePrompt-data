Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
