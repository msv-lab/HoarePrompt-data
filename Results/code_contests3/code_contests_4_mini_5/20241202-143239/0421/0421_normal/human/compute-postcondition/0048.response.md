Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `len(nums)` is greater than 3. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
