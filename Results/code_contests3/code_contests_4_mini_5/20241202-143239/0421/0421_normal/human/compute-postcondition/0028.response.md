Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is set to False, and `i` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the loop will break if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2. If the condition is not met, the loop continues executing.***
