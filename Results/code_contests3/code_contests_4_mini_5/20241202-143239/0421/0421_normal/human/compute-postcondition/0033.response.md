Output State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False if any absolute difference between consecutive elements of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `flag` remains True. The value of `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, or less than that if it breaks.**
