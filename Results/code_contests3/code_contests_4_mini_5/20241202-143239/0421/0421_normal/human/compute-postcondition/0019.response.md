According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will only execute if `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False, which means the loop cannot execute again. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be adjusted to True. The state of `nums` does not need to be adjusted further since it is already a non-empty collection (as it was specified that the maximum value has been removed, but it doesn't imply that `nums` is empty).

State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, flag is True, and the maximum value has been removed from nums**
