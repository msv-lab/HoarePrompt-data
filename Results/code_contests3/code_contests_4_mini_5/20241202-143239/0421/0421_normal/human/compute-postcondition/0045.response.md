According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `nums` has at least 2 elements (since it's not empty and contains at least 2 elements). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The condition to check for breaking out of the loop based on the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` will still apply. However, to execute the loop again, `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 3.**
