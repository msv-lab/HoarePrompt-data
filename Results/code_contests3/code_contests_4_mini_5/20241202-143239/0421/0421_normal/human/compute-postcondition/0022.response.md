The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, but no other variables are affected by this change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
