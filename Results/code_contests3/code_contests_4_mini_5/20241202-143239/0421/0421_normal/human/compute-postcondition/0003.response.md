According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, which is acceptable for the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty. 

Since `nums` is derived from the input string `n`, we must ensure that `n` represents a valid integer that can yield a non-empty map object. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be a string that, when converted to an integer, results in a list or collection of integers that is not empty.

To ensure `nums` is not empty, `n` should be a string that represents a valid integer (e.g., "0", "1", "2", etc.) such that there are corresponding integers in the map object. 

State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers derived from the input string.**
