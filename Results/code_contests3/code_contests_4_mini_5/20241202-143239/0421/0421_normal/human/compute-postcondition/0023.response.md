The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or control structure.
