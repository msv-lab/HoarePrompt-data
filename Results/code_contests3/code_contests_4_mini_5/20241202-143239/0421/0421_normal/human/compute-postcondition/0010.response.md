The value of `flag` is explicitly set to `False`, but since `flag` was already `False`, there is no change in its state. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, as they are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers, `i` is 1**
