According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. The loop will execute if the length of `nums` (which is not empty) is at least 2, since `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0 for `i` to take on any values in the range. Additionally, `n` being a string representing a valid integer does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but it is still part of the state.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will hold the last value it took during the loop execution. However, before the loop starts, `i` must be initialized to its starting value, which is 0. 

For the loop to execute successfully the first time, `nums` must contain at least 2 elements. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty (with at least 2 elements), `i` is 0**
