According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. The loop will execute again as long as `i` remains less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1, and it must hold that `len(nums)` is greater than 1 (which is implied since `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers). 

State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 1**
