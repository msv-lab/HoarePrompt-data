To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions based on the variables involved in the loop: `flag` and `nums`.

1. The loop will continue executing as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty.
2. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `flag` is False if there is any absolute difference between consecutive elements of `nums` that is greater than or equal to 2. If `flag` is currently False, it means that the condition for continuing the loop is not met.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` needs to be True, which implies that the absolute difference between all consecutive elements of `nums` must be less than 2.
4. Additionally, `nums` must also not be empty for the loop to execute again.

Given that `flag` is currently False and the maximum value in `nums` has been removed, we need to adjust `flag` to True. This adjustment indicates that the absolute differences between the remaining elements in `nums` must be such that they meet the criteria for `flag` to be True.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to state that `flag` must be True and `nums` must not be empty.

State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, flag is True, and nums is not empty**.
