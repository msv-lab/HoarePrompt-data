The variable `nums` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which converts a space-separated string input into a list of integers. The value of `n` is an input string representing an integer, but the specific integers produced by splitting the input string are not known. The variable `flag` remains unchanged as True. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a map object containing integers derived from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a map object containing integers derived from the input string.**
