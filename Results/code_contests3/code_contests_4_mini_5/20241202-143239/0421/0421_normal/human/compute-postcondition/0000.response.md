The value of `n` is assigned the result of `input()`, which accepts user input. Since `n` is expected to be an integer representing the size of the array, it will hold a string value until it is converted to an integer. The heights of the stacks are not affected at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string (representing an integer).

Output State: **`n` is an input string (representing an integer)**
