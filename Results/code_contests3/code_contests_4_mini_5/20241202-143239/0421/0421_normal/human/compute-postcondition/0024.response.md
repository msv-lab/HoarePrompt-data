Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is set to False, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or control structure. Otherwise, the loop continues executing, as `flag` remains True.***
