In the provided code snippet, `nums.remove(max(nums))` is executed. This line of code removes the maximum value from the `nums` map object. The previous values of `nums` are not explicitly defined, other than it being a non-empty map object containing integers. The removal of the maximum value affects the contents of `nums`, but the values of `n` and `flag` remain unchanged. 

Since `nums` is a non-empty collection of integers, the maximum value will be successfully identified and removed. However, we do not know the specific integers contained within `nums`, so we cannot ascertain the exact outcome of the removal operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and notes the action taken on `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, and the maximum value has been removed from `nums`.**
