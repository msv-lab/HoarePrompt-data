The function accepts an integer `n` representing the size of an array and then `n` space-separated integers representing the heights of the stacks. It checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive heights is less than 2. If any difference is 2 or more, it sets a flag to False. The function removes the maximum height from the list iteratively until the list is empty or the flag is set to False. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True (indicating all differences were within the acceptable range) and 'NO' otherwise.
