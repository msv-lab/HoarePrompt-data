The function accepts an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers. It checks whether the absolute difference between any two adjacent integers in the list is less than 2. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False. The function continues to remove the maximum value from the list until it becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'YES' if no adjacent integers had an absolute difference of 2 or more, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Note that the function does not handle cases where `n` is not provided or the input format is incorrect.
