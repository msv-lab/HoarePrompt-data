To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop. The loop can only execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty.

1. `flag` is False if any adjacent elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more. Since `flag` needs to be True for the loop to run again, we need to ensure that there are no adjacent elements in `nums` that meet this condition. Therefore, the state of `flag` needs to be adjusted to True.

2. `nums` contains at least one element, and the maximum element has been removed from `nums`. However, since the maximum element has been removed, we do not know the exact count of elements remaining in `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty.

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `flag` must be adjusted to True.
- `nums` must be ensured to contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is True, and `nums` contains at least one element**.
