The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
