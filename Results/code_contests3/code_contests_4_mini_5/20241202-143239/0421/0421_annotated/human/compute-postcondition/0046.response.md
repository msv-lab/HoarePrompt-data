The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, which means it remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`**
