Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.***
