According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, which means it is now equal to the previous value of `i + 1`. Since `nums` contains at least 2 elements, the condition `i < len(nums) - 1` must be satisfied for the loop to execute one more time.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 again. Thus, for the loop to execute again:
- `i` will become `i + 1`.
- The length of `nums` must be greater than `i + 1` to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
