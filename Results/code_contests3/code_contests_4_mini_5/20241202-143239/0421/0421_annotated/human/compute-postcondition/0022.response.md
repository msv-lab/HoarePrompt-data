The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value of `True`. The values of `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
