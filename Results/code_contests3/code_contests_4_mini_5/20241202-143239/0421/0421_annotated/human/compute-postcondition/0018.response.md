The value of `nums` is modified by removing the maximum value from the list. The previous values of `nums` are unknown, but it contains at least one element. After the execution, `nums` will have one less element than it had before. Other variables (`n` and `flag`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is either True or False, and `nums` has one less element after removing the maximum value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is either True or False, and `nums` has one less element after removing the maximum value.**
