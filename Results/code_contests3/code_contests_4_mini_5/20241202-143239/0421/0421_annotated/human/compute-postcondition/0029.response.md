According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` was `k` before the increment, it is now `k + 1`.

To determine if the loop can execute another time, we need to check if `i + 1` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`. If `i` is currently equal to `len(nums) - 2`, then the loop can execute one more time. 

Since `i` has been incremented by 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `len(nums) - 2` after this increment. Therefore, the updated value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 1` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1` (which is `len(nums)`).**
