`flag` is assigned the value `False`, which it already held. Therefore, the state of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `flag` remains `False` while the other variables retain their previous states. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
