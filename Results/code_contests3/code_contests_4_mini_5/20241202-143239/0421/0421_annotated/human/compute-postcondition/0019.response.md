According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` can be either True or False, and `nums` currently has one less element after removing the maximum value. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be True and `nums` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, if `flag` is currently False, it needs to be adjusted to True. Additionally, since `nums` has one less element than before, it must still have at least one element remaining.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is either True or False, and for the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` must contain at least one element**
