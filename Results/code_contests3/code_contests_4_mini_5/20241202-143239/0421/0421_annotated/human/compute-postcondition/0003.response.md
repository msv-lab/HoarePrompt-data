According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` (a map object) is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, so we only need to ensure that `nums` is not empty. Since `nums` is a map object containing integers converted from the input, it will be empty if the string `n` is empty or consists only of whitespace. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, `n` must be a non-empty string that, when split by spaces, results in at least one integer. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it contains valid input.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is True**
