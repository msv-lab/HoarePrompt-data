Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least one element, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
