In the given code, `print['NO', 'YES'][flag]` is evaluated. The variable `flag` determines which value is printed: if `flag` is `True`, it will print 'YES', and if `flag` is `False`, it will print 'NO'. 

Since `flag` is specified as False, the output will be 'NO'. The state of other variables (`n` and `nums`) does not change as a result of this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer; `flag` is False; `nums` is empty after all maximum values have been removed; output is 'NO'.**
