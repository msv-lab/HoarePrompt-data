The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
