According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. The loop will execute if `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, which requires that `len(nums)` be at least 2. Since `nums` contains at least one element, we can assume that its size needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration, we can set `i` to 0. The provided state of `flag` and `n` does not directly affect the loop execution in this context.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is True, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
