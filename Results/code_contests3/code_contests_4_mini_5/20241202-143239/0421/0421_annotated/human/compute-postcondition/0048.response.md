Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
