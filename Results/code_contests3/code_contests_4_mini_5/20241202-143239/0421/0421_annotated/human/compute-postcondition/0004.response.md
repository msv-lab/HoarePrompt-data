According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `nums`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1, which implies that `nums` must contain at least 2 elements. 

Given that `n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The `flag` variable being `True` does not influence the loop execution either. The loop index variable `i` starts from 0, and we need to ensure that `nums` has at least 2 elements.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `nums` must be a list with at least 2 elements, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string containing at least one integer, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
