Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is either True or False depending on the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `nums`, `nums` contains at least 1 element, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2` if `flag` is True (indicating all consecutive differences were less than 2), or it is less than `len(nums) - 2` if `flag` is False (indicating at least one absolute difference was greater than or equal to 2).**
