Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and if the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` of `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
