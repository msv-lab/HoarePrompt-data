The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0; `flag` is set to False; `nums` contains at least 3 elements; `i` is len(nums) - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
