The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its current value, so there is no change to `flag`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**.
