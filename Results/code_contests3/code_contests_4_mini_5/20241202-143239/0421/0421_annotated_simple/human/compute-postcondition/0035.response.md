According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` can either be True or False, and `nums` contains one less element after removing the maximum. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be True, and `nums` must contain at least one element.

1. If `flag` is False, then the loop cannot execute again. For the loop to execute again, `flag` needs to be set to True.
2. If `flag` is True, then `nums` must have at least one element. Since it currently has one less element after removing the maximum, it must have had at least two elements before the last iteration. Therefore, it should still contain at least one element.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the `flag` to True if it is currently False. If `flag` is already True, no adjustment is needed, but we must ensure that `nums` contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is True, `nums` contains at least one element, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` if `flag` is False, or `len(nums) - 2` if `flag` remains True**.
