Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, and `i` is `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
