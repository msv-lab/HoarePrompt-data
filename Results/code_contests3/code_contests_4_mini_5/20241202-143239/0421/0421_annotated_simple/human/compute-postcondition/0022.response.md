The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is len(nums) - 2, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
