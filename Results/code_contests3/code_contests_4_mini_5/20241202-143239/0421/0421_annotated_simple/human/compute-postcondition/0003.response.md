According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, which is fine, but we need to ensure that `nums` is not empty. Since `nums` is a map object created from input strings, it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the input string `n` must represent an integer greater than 0 to ensure that `nums` contains elements after conversion. 

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0; `flag` is True; `nums` contains at least one element.**
