Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). It checks if all consecutive elements in the array have an absolute difference of less than 2. If any such pair is found, the function returns 'NO'; otherwise, it returns 'YES' after removing the maximum element from the array iteratively until it's empty or the condition fails. Note that the function may not handle certain edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is less than 1 or when the input format is incorrect.**
