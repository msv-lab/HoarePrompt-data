Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
