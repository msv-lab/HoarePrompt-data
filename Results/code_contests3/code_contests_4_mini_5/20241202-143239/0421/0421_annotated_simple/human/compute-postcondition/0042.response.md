`flag` is assigned the value `False`, which is its current value, so there is no change. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `i` is not less than `len(nums) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `i` is not less than `len(nums) - 1.**
