According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. 

Since `nums` contains at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1, and we also need to ensure that the condition regarding the absolute difference between elements at index `i` and `i + 1` is satisfied to avoid breaking out of the loop. 

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` must be less than 2.**
