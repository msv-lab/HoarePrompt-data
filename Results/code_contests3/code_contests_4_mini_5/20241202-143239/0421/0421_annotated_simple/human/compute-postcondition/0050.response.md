Output State: **`n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0; `flag` is False if any pair of consecutive elements in `nums` has an absolute difference of 2 or more, otherwise `flag` remains True; `nums` contains one less element after removing the maximum value; `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1` if the loop executed fully without a break, or it is less than `len(nums) - 1` if the loop exited early due to the condition being satisfied.**
