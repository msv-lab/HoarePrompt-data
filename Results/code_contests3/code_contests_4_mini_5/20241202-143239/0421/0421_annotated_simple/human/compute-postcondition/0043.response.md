The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `i` is not less than `len(nums) - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
