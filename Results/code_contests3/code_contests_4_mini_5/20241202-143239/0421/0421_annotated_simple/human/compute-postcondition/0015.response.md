The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 3 elements, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
