The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input string. The initial state indicates that `n` should be an integer representing the size of the array, but since `input()` returns a string, the variable `n` becomes a string representation of the input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing the integer for the size of the array.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing the integer for the size of the array.**
