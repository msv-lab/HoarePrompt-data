Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, leading to a break from the most internal loop or if statement.***
