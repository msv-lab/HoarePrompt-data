Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part.***
