Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing an integer greater than 0, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the execution continues without interruption.***
