The function `func` does not have any parameters directly passed to it. Instead, it relies on input that consists of an integer `n`, which represents the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` that represent the elements of the array. 

Based on the output description, the function performs operations on the array elements but the specific return value is not provided in the output. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality without additional information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) which represent the elements of an array. The specific return value of the function is not detailed.**
