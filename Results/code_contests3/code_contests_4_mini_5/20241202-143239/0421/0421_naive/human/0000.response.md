To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to break down both the problem and the program logic.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if a given array can be sorted using a specific procedure involving stacks of ravioli. The key points to note are:
1. You must identify the tallest stack and remove it.
2. If two stacks differ in height by 2 or more, ravioli from the taller stack slide down onto the shorter stack, which can potentially change the heights of the stacks before the tallest is even selected.
3. The output should be "YES" if the array can be sorted and "NO" if it cannot.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:
```python
n = input()
flag = True
nums = map(int, raw_input().split())
while flag and nums:
    for i in xrange(len(nums) - 1):
        if abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2:
            flag = False
            break
    nums.remove(max(nums))
print['NO', 'YES'][flag]
```

### Issues Identified
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with Python 3 (it should be `input()` instead). This would lead to an error in Python 3.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The loop only checks if the absolute difference between adjacent elements is 2 or more. However, it does not account for the fact that if two adjacent stacks differ by 2 or more, the taller stack's ravioli slide down, which means the current `nums` array may change even before we remove the tallest stack. The program does not simulate this sliding effect, which is critical to checking if the array can be sorted using the described procedure.
3. **Termination Condition**: The program may not correctly handle the termination condition, as it could end up in an infinite loop if the modification of `nums` is not correctly managed after removing the maximum.

### Test Case
Let's consider the input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
- The expected output is "NO" because the stack with height 3 would slide down onto the stack with height 1 before we get a chance to select the tallest stack.
- However, the program as written would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks the condition for adjacent pairs without simulating the sliding effect.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues, particularly the failure to simulate the sliding effect and the incorrect handling of input in Python 3, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
