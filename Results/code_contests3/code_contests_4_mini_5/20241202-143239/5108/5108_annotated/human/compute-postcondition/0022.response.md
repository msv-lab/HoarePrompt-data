Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input from the user. It checks if the input contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and terminates the loop. If none of these characters are present, it prints 'NO' after the loop. The function essentially determines if the input string includes specific instructions from the HQ9+ programming language. **
