The variable `a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`, which changes the previous value of `a`. The variable `i`, which is the first character of the previous string `a`, will now be `'t'`. Since `i` is no longer 'H', 'Q', or '9', the condition for printing 'YES' is not satisfied. As such, the values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't'.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't'**
