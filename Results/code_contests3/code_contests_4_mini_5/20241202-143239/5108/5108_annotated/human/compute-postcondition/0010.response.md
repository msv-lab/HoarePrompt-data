The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 's', and 'YES' is printed; `a` is assigned the value 'tstr123' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
