`a` is assigned the value `'tstr123'`, and since this does not affect any other variables in the initial state, the output state will reflect the assignment of `a`. The variable `p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'.
Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'**
