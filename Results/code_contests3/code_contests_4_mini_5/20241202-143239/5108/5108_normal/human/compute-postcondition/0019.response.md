The code snippet prints the string 'NO'. Since the previous state indicates that 'YES' has been printed if 'H', 'Q', or '9' was present in the string `a`, and it has not been printed otherwise, the output state reflects the action taken without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `p` remains a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` remains unchanged; and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is unchanged; 'NO' is printed.**
