The function accepts a string input, checks for the presence of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and alters the variable `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, and it only prints output based on the conditions evaluated.
