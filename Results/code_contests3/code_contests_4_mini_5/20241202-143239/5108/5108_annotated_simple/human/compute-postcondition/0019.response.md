The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `p`, `a`, and `i` do not change as a result of this execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the last character of the input string 'a', and `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is the last character of the input string 'a', and `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', and 'NO' is printed.**
