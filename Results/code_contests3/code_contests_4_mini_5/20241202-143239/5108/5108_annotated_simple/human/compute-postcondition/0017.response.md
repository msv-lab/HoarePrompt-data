Output State: **`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is the last character of the input string 'a'. If any character in 'a' is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', 'YES' is printed and the loop exits early; otherwise, the loop will have gone through all characters of 'a' without printing 'YES'.**
