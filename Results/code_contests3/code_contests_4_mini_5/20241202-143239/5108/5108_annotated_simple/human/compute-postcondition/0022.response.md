Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of 1 to 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126. It checks if any character in the input string is 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and exits the loop. If none of these characters are found after checking all characters, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
