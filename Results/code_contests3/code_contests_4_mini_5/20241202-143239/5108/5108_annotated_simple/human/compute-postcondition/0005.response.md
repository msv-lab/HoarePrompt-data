The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
