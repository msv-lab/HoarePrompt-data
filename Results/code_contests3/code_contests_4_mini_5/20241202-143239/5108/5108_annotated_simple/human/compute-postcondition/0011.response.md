Postcondition: ***`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126; `a` is 'tstr123'; `i` is 's'. If `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9', then 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues executing without printing 'YES'.***
