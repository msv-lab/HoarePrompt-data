Postcondition: ***`p` is a string consisting of 1 to 100 characters with ASCII codes between 33 and 126, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is the last character of the input string 'a'. If `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the program does not execute any action as there is no else part.***
