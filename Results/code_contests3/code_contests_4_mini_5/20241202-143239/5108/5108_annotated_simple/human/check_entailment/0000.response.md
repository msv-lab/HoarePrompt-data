Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Instructions**: The program only checks for the characters 'H', 'Q', and '9' to print "YES". However, according to the problem description, the presence of the character '+' should also lead to a "YES" output since it is part of the instructions that produce output.

2. **Output Logic**: The program uses a variable `a` to track whether any of the specified characters have been found. It sets `a` to 'tstr123' when it finds one of the instructions, but then checks if `a` is not equal to 'tstr123' to decide whether to print "NO". This logic is convoluted and could lead to confusion. If no valid character is found, it should print "NO" directly after the loop.

3. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with Python 3 (it should be `input()`), and does not match the expected usage context of the function.

4. **Ignoring Other Characters**: The program should ignore other characters, which it does, but it fails to consider that the presence of '+' should also trigger an output.

Overall, the program does not fulfill the requirement to check for all four instructions ('H', 'Q', '9', and '+') and thus does not correctly determine if the program will produce any output based on the problem description.
