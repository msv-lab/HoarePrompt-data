The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates the smallest integer composed solely of the digits '7' and '4' with equal counts of each, which is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such integer exists, it returns the default value of 4444477777. If `l`, the length of `n`, is odd, it adjusts `l` to the next even number for generating candidates. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the result directly.
