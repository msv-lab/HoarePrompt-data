The variable `x` is the first combination of ten characters from '7' and '4', with equal counts of '7' and '4'. This means `x` consists of five '7's and five '4's. When we join these characters and convert the result to an integer, it forms the number `7777744444`. Thus, `tem` is assigned this value.

The other variables `n`, `l`, `i`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is the minimum integer formed by concatenating digits '7' and '4' with equal counts of each; `x` is '7777744444'; `tem` is 7777744444.**
