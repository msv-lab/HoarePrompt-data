According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which determines how many times the product is generated from the characters '7' and '4'. The loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is within the specified range.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 5 or 7. For the loop to execute one more time:
- If `i` is 5, the next value of `i` would be 6, which means that the product would generate combinations of length 6.
- If `i` is 7, the next value of `i` would be 8, which means that the product would generate combinations of length 8.

The variable `n` is an input integer and does not affect the looping condition directly since there is no else part in the code. Thus, the loop can continue executing as long as the value of `i` is less than or equal to the maximum expected value (which is 10).

At the end of the last iteration, we need to account for the next valid value of `i` and ensure that it reflects the progression of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 6 or 8; if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code.**
