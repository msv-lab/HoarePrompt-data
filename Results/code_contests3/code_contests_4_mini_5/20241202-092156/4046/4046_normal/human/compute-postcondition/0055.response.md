Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is 7777744444; `x` is '7777744444'; `tem` is 7777744444. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `n`, `l`, `i`, `ans`, `x`, and `tem` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the state remains unaffected as there’s no else part in the code.***
