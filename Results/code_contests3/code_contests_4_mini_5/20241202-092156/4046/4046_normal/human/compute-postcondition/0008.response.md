The value of `tem` is assigned the integer value obtained by joining the elements of `x`. The final output of `tem` will depend on the contents of `x`. However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state provided, we cannot ascertain its content. Therefore, we can only state that `tem` will hold an integer value derived from `x`.

Since the initial state indicates that the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x'; `tem` is an integer derived from joining the elements of `x`**.
