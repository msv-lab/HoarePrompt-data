Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is 7777744444; `x` is the next product combination of '7' and '4' of length 10; `tem` is 7777744444. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then no changes are made to the variables.***
