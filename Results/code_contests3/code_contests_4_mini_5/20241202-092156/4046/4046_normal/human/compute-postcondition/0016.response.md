Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is derived from joining the elements of `x` into an integer. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Otherwise, there is no change to `ans` since there is no else part.***
