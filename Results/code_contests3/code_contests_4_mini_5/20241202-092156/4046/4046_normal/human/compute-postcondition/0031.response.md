Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 4 (or 6) and is less than 8. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', then `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string representation of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If the counts are not equal, there are no changes made to `ans`.***
