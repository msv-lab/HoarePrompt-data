The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means `tem` is derived from concatenating the elements of the list `x` and converting that result into an integer. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the state of `tem` now depends on the contents of `x`, which is not directly provided. The conditions regarding the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` and the relationship of `tem` to `n` are also not explicitly defined here. Thus, we can only describe the state of `tem` based on its definition.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l + 1`, `tem` is derived from joining the elements of `x` into an integer.**
