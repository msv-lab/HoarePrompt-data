The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. However, the value of `x` is not defined in the initial state, and thus we do not have sufficient information to determine the result of the `join` operation or the final integer value of `tem`. As a result, the output state will reflect the lack of information about the variable `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 5 or 7; `tem` is undefined due to the lack of information about `x`.**
