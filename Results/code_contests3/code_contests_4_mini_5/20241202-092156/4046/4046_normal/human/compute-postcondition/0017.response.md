Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, and `i` is `l + 1`. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x', and if the integer `tem`, derived from joining the elements of `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Otherwise, there is no change to `ans`.***
