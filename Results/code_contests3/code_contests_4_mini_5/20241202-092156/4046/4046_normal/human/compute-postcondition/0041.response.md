Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 6 or 8; if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', and if `tem` (the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged. If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code.***
