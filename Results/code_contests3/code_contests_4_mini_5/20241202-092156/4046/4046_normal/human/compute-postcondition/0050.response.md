Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is the minimum integer formed by concatenating digits '7' and '4' with equal counts of each; `x` is '7777744444'; if `x` has equal counts of '7' and '4', and if the integer 7777744444 is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to 7777744444. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
