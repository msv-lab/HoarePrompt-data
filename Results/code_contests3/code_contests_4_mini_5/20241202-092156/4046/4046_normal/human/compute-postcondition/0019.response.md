The variable `tem` is assigned the value `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so the result of `int(''.join(x))` cannot be determined. However, `tem` will be an integer constructed from the elements of `x`. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l + 2`, and `tem` is an integer formed from `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer formed from `x`.**
