Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is `l + 2`; `tem` is an integer formed from `x`. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, then `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.***
