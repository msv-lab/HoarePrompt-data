The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is an integer derived from joining elements of `x` and is greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `ans` may change depending on its initial value. However, since we do not have the initial value of `ans`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer derived from joining the elements of `x`, `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.
