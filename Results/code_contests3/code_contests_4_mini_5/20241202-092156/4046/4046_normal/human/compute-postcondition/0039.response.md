The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The previous value of `tem` is formed by joining the elements of `x`, and the value of `tem` is compared to `n`. Since `ans` remains unchanged if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output state will reflect this condition.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `tem` are not specified, we can denote them as `ans` and `tem`, respectively, with the condition that if `tem` is not less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`; if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to min(`ans`, `tem`) if `tem` is less than `n`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
