Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, and `i` is `l`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', and `tem`, derived from joining the elements of `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
