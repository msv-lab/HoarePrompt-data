The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is the next product combination of '7' and '4' of length 10. The value of `x` is not explicitly provided, but it represents a string of ten characters formed by the digits '7' and '4'. The specific combination will determine the value of `tem`. 

Since `tem` is initially 7777744444, we can infer that the value of `x` must correspond to a combination that, when joined together and converted to an integer, results in 7777744444. Therefore, the value of `tem` will overwrite its previous value.

The output state reflects the new value of `tem` after executing the code. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, `ans`, and `x` remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is 7777744444; `x` is the next product combination of '7' and '4' of length 10; `tem` is 7777744444**
