The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is a string containing '7777744444'. The `join` method is used to concatenate the characters in `x`, which results in the same string '7777744444'. The `int` function then converts this string into the integer 7777744444. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is 7777744444; `x` is '7777744444'; `tem` is 7777744444; for the loop to execute one more time, there are no further combinations of '7' and '4' of length 10 to generate.**
