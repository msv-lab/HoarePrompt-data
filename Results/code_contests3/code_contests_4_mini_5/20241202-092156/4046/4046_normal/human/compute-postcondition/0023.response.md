Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is `l`, and `ans` is the minimum integer formed from combinations of '7' and '4' with equal counts of both, that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such combinations exist, `ans` remains unchanged.**
