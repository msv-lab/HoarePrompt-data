`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is equal to 7777744444, we check the value of `ans` (which is the minimum integer formed by concatenating equal counts of '7' and '4'). The specific value of `ans` is not provided, but it is less than or equal to `tem` since we are taking the minimum. Therefore, the output will depend on the comparison between `ans` and `tem`.

If `ans` is less than `tem`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` will be updated to `tem`. Given that `tem` is a large number and `ans` is formed by a specific pattern, `ans` is likely to be less than `tem`.

So, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is the minimum integer formed by concatenating digits '7' and '4' with equal counts of each; `x` is '7777744444'; `tem` is 7777744444; `ans` remains the same or is updated to 7777744444 if it was greater.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is the minimum integer formed by concatenating digits '7' and '4' with equal counts of each; `x` is '7777744444'; `tem` is 7777744444; `ans` remains unchanged or updated to 7777744444.**
