The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since `n` is not explicitly passed as a parameter to the function, it suggests that `n` might be set or defined elsewhere in the code, possibly as a global variable or through user input.

As there is no output specification provided, we cannot determine what the function returns. Therefore, we can only state the following:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
