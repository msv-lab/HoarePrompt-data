The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `ans` is 7777744444 and `tem` is also 7777744444, the minimum is 7777744444, so `ans` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 10; `ans` is 7777744444; `x` is the next product combination of '7' and '4' of length 10; `tem` is 7777744444.
