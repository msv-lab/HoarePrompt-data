Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}, `i` is 10, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by concatenating digits '7' and '4' with equal counts of each, that is greater than or equal to `n`, or remains unchanged if no such integer exists, `x` is the first combination of ten characters from '7' and '4', and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
