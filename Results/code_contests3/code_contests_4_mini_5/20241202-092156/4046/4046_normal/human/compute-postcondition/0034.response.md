The code snippet assigns the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value or `tem`. Without knowing the value of `tem`, we cannot determine the specific value of `ans` after execution. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 5 or 7; `tem` is undefined; `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 5 or 7; `tem` is undefined; `ans` remains unchanged.**
