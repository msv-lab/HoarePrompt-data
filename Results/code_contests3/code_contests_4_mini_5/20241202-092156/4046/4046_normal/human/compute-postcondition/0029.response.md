In this code snippet, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between itself and `tem`. The value of `tem` is already established to be greater than or equal to `n`, but we do not have the prior value of `ans`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is one of {2, 4, 6, 8}; `i` is 4 (or 6) and is less than 8; the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x'; `tem` is assigned the integer value of the concatenated string representation of `x` and is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, `tem`).**
