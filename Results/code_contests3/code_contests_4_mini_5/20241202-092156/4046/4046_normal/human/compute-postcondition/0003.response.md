`l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 (as it is an odd number), the possible new values for `l` after the increment are 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, respectively. The values of `n` and `ans` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, and `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `l` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, and `ans` is 4444477777.**
