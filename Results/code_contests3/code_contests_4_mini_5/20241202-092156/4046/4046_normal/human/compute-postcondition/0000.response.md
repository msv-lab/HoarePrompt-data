The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within that range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
