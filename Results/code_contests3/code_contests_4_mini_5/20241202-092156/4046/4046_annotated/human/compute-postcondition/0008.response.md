The variable `x` is defined as the first product from '74' repeated `i` times. Given that `i` is equal to `l` and `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `x` would be a string made up of the characters '74' repeated `l` times. 

The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the string formed by `x` into an integer. The value of `x` will be '74' repeated `l` times, resulting in a string that alternates between '7' and '4'.

Since the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, the number of '7's and '4's in `x` will both equal `l`. 

Thus, if `l` is 1, `x` would be '74', and `tem` would be 74. If `l` is 2, `x` would be '7474', giving `tem` a value of 7474, and so on, up to a maximum of `l` being 9, in which case `x` would be '74747474747474747474' and `tem` would be 747474747.

However, since the exact value of `l` is not provided, we can only state that `tem` will be an integer value composed of the digits '7' and '4' in alternating order based on `l`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `tem` is a positive integer derived from the string `x`, which is constructed from repeating '74' a number of times determined by `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is '74' repeated `l` times, `tem` is an integer formed from `x`.**
