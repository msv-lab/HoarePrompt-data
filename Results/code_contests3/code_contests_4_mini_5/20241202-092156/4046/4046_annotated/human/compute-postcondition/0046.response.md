The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a collection that presumably contains the characters '7' and '4' in a combination. The specifics of `x` are not given, but it is mentioned that the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9 and `ans` is defined as the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n`, we can infer that `tem` will represent a valid number formed by the digits '7' and '4'.

However, without the exact contents of `x`, we cannot definitively compute a specific value for `tem`. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `tem` while acknowledging the constraints of the other variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 7; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n`; `i` is 9; `count of '7' in x` is equal to `count of '4' in x`; `tem` is the integer formed from the combination of `x`.**
