Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `tem` is the integer formed from combinations of '74', and `i` is now `l + 2`. If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.***
