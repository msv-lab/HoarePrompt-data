Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is `l`, and `tem` is the integer value formed by the combination generated by `product('74', repeat=l)`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the value of `tem`.***
