According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which determines the length of the combinations generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`. Given that `i` is now `l + 2` and `l` is less than or equal to 7, we can conclude that `i` can take values from 2 to 9.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l + 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. This means that the next value of `i` will be `l + 3`.

The `product` function generates combinations of '74' with the new value of `i`. Since `i` now is `l + 3`, the loop will execute again for combinations of length `l + 3`.

Thus, we can summarize the current state as follows: `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `l` is still less than or equal to 7, `tem` is still the integer formed from combinations of '74', `i` will be updated to `l + 3`, and since we are not directly modifying `tem` or `ans` at this point, they will remain the same unless conditions are met during the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `tem` is the integer formed from combinations of '74', `i` is now `l + 3` for the loop to execute one more time.**
