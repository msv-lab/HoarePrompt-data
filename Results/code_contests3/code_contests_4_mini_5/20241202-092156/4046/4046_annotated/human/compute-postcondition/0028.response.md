Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, `tem` is the last valid integer formed from combinations of '74', `i` is less than 10, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the elements of `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
