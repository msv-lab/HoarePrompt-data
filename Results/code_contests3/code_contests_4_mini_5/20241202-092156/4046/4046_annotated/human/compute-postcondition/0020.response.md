The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `ans` is previously defined as the minimum of `4444477777` and `tem`. Since `tem` is generated from the combination of the digits '74' repeated `l + 1` times, it can be a number formed by these digits, and its value is dependent on `l`. Therefore, we can conclude the following:

- `ans` takes the minimum of its current value and `tem`.
- The previous value of `ans` is determined by comparing `4444477777` with `tem`.

Since we don't have the specific value of `tem`, the exact value of `ans` after this operation cannot be determined. Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between `ans` and `tem`, along with the constraints given.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 9; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`; `i` is `l + 1`; `tem` is generated from combinations of '74' repeated `l + 1` times; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
