The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is presumably a list of strings. This means that `tem` is converted to an integer by joining the elements of `x` into a single string and then converting that string to an integer. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. The previous conditions state that `tem` is valid and formed from combinations of '74', so `tem` will be a positive integer formed from those characters.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 7; `tem` is the integer formed from combinations of '74'; `i` is now `l + 2`**
