Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n`, and `i` is 10. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
