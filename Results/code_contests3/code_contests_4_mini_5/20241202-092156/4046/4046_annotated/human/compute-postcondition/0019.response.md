To analyze the given Python code snippet:

1. The variable `tem` is assigned a new value calculated from the combination generated.
2. The expression `int(''.join(x))` converts the combination of digits generated from `product('74', repeat=l + 1)` into an integer.
3. The variable `x` is the output of the `product` function, which creates all possible combinations of the digits '7' and '4' of length `l + 1`.

Since `l` is a positive integer such that `1 <= l < 9`, `l + 1` can range from 2 to 9. Therefore, `tem` will be an integer formed by a combination of '7' and '4' characters.

The minimum value of `ans` will relate to the value of `tem`, but since it is mentioned that `ans` is the minimum of `4444477777` and `tem`, we will need to consider that `tem` could be less than `4444477777` depending on the combination generated.

The impact of the code is that `tem` now holds a specific integer value formed by the combinations, and `ans` will be assigned a value based on the comparison of `tem` and `4444477777`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the assignment of `tem` and its relationship with `ans`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 9, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is the integer value formed by the combination generated by `product('74', repeat=l + 1)`**.
