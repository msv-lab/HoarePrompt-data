Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is '74' repeated `l` times, and `tem` is an integer formed from `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to `tem`; otherwise, `ans` remains 4444477777.***
