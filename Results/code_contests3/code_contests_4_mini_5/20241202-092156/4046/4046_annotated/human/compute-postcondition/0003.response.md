The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), after the increment, `l` will become even (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10). The values of `n` and `ans` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is now even (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10); `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is now even (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10); `ans` is 4444477777**
