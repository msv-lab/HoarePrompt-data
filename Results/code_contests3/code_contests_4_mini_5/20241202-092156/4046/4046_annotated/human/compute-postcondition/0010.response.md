The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The current value of `ans` is 4444477777, and `tem` is an integer formed from `x`, which is '74' repeated `l` times. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9, we know that `tem` will also be a positive integer greater than or equal to `n` and potentially less than or equal to 4444477777. Therefore, the minimum value will depend on the specific value of `tem`. 

If `tem` is less than `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to `tem`; otherwise, it will remain 4444477777. However, since we do not have the exact value of `tem`, we cannot definitively state the new value of `ans`. 

Thus, the output state is: `ans` is either updated to `tem` or remains 4444477777.

Output State: **`ans` is either updated to `tem` or remains 4444477777**
