According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which represents the current length of the combinations being generated. The loop will continue to execute until all combinations of '74' of length `i` are produced. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l`, and `x` is the current combination generated. The next execution of the loop would generate the combination for `i + 1`, which is `l + 1`. Since `l` is constrained to be less than 10, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than 9, and the next combination will be generated.

Additionally, the count of '7' in the generated combination `x` must equal the count of '4' in that combination for `ans` to possibly be updated. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 9, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is the integer value formed by the combination generated by `product('74', repeat=l + 1)`.**
