Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 7; `tem` is the integer formed from combinations of '74'; `i` is `l + 3`; `tem` is assigned the value of the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `tem`.***
