Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, and `x` is '74' repeated `l` times. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is formed from `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to `tem`; otherwise, `ans` remains 4444477777.***
