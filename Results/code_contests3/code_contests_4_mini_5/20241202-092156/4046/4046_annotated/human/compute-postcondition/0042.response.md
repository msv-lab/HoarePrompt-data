Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + k` where `k` is the number of iterations executed (up to 10 - 2). If no valid `tem` is found that meets the conditions, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
