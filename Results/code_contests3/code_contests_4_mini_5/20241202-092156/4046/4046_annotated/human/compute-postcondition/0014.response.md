The variable `x` is a combination generated by `product('74', repeat=l)`, which results in a tuple of characters. When `x` is joined into a string and converted into an integer using `int`, it assigns this integer value to `tem`. The value of `tem` depends on the specific combination generated by `x`. The values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `tem` is the integer value formed by the combination generated by `product('74', repeat=l)`**.
