Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `l` < 9; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`; `i` is `l + 1`; and `tem` is generated from combinations of '74' repeated `l + 1` times. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
