According to the code, the loop iterates over all combinations of '7' and '4', with the number of combinations determined by the current value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is assigned the value of `l + 2`, where `l` is less than or equal to 7. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be greater than or equal to `3` (since `l + 2` can be a minimum of `3` when `l` is `1`).

The loop will execute again if the conditions are met for the new value of `i`. Since `i` is now greater than 2, the next iteration will generate combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`. Specifically, if `i` is equal to `l + 2`, the loop will execute for the next combination of length `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `tem` is valid and formed from combinations of '74', `i` is now `l + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be equal to at least 3.**
