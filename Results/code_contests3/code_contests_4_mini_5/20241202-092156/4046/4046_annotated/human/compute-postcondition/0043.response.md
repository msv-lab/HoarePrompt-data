According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from `l` and increasing by 2 each time until it reaches 10. The state at the end of the last iteration specifies that `i` is `l + k`, where `k` is the number of iterations executed. The loop is set to execute while `i` is less than 10.

Given that `l` is less than or equal to 7, the maximum value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration could be 9 (if `l` is 7 and one iteration has been executed). 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 10. Since `i` is currently `l + k` and `k` has to be less than or equal to 8 (since it can go from 0 to 8), we need to adjust `i` to the next valid value. The next value of `i` will be 9 + 2 = 11 (which exceeds 10), indicating that the loop will not execute again.

Thus, to execute the loop for one more time, `i` needs to be less than 10. Since `i` is currently at its maximum valid value of 9, we need to ensure that `i` is updated to 9 for there to be a possibility of executing the loop again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is 9, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 10.**
