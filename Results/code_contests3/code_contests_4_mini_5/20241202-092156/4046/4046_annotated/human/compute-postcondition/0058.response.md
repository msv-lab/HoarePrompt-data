The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The previous value of `ans` is defined as the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n`. Since `tem` is also a valid integer formed from combinations of '74', it will either be less than, equal to, or greater than `ans`. The current value of `i` and the constraints on `n` and `l` do not affect the computation of `ans`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on `ans` and its relationship to `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`**
