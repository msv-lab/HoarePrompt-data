Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 7, and `tem` is valid and formed from combinations of '74'. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, while `i` is assigned the value of `l + 2`.***
