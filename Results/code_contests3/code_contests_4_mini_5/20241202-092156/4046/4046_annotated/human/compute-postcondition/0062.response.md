Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n` if any valid `tem` exists. If no valid `tem` is found that meets the conditions, `ans` remains 4444477777.**
