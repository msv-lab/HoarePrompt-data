The function accepts a positive integer input `n` and generates combinations of the digits '4' and '7' to find the smallest integer composed of these digits that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no valid combination exists, it returns the hardcoded value 4444477777. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 10^9, as it assumes the input will always be within this range.
