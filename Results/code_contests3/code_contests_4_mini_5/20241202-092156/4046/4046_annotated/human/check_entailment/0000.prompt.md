You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that positive integers are lucky if their decimal representation doesn't contain digits other than 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Lucky number is super lucky if it's decimal representation contains equal amount of digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 7744, 474477 are super lucky and 4, 744, 467 are not.

One day Petya came across a positive integer n. Help him to find the least super lucky number which is not less than n.

Input

The only line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109). This number doesn't have leading zeroes.

Output

Output the least super lucky number that is more than or equal to n.

Please, do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.

Examples

Input

4500


Output

4747


Input

47


Output

47
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    l, ans = len(str(n)), 4444477777
    if (l & 1) :
        l += 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. If `l` is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), then `l` remains unchanged, and `ans` is 4444477777. If `l` is even (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10), then `l` is now even and `ans` is still 4444477777.
    for i in range(l, 10, 2):
        for x in product('74', repeat=i):
            if x.count('7') == x.count('4'):
                tem = int(''.join(x))
                if tem >= n:
                    ans = min(ans, tem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the smallest valid `tem` formed from combinations of '74' that is greater than or equal to `n` if any valid `tem` exists. If no valid `tem` is found that meets the conditions, `ans` remains 4444477777.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer input `n` and generates combinations of the digits '4' and '7' to find the smallest integer composed of these digits that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no valid combination exists, it returns the hardcoded value 4444477777. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 10^9, as it assumes the input will always be within this range.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
