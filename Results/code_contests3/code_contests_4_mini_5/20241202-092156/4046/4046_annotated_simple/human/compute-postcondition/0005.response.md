According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. The loop starts at `l` and increments `i` by 2, running until `i` is less than 10. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than 10.

Given that `l` is a positive integer, if `l` is even, the state remains unchanged. If `l` is odd, the state also remains unchanged, but the loop will not execute since the starting point `l` is odd and will not satisfy the loop condition.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `l` should be even and less than 10. Hence, the necessary condition is that `l` must be an even number less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`**
