According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i` which starts at `l` and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l + 2`. Since `l` is an even number less than 10, the possible values for `i` could be `l`, `l + 2`, `l + 4`, `l + 6`, and `l + 8`. 

To determine the next value of `i`, we need to add 2 to the current value of `i`. Thus, if `i` is currently `l + 2`, the next value of `i` will be `l + 4`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than 10, which means `l + 4` must be less than 10. 

Since `l` is an even number less than 10, the maximum value for `l` is 8. If `l` were 8, then `i` would become 10 after this increment, which would not allow the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `l` can be at most 6, resulting in `i` reaching a value of 8.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 4`, for the loop to execute a second time `l` must be less than or equal to 6**
