The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value (77) and the value of `tem`, which is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774. Since 77 is less than all possible values of `tem`, `ans` remains 77. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 depending on its previous value, `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, `tem` is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 depending on its previous value, `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, `tem` is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774.**
