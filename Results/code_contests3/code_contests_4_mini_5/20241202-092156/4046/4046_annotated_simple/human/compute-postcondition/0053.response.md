The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its previous value and `tem`. The values of `ans` and `tem` are not specified, but since `ans` is described as the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, we can infer that `ans` will either remain the same or change based on the comparison with `tem`. The other variables `n` and `l` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `tem` is assigned the integer value of the joined string `x`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.**
