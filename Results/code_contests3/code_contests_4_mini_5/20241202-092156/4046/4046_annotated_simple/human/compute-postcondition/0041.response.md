Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `tem` is an integer derived from `''.join(x)`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. There is no else part in the code.***
