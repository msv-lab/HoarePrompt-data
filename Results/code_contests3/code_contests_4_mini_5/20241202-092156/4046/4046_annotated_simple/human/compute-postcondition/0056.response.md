According to the code, the loop iterates over all combinations of the characters '7' and '4' of length `i`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `i`, which would be `i + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, and `n` is a positive integer. Since `l` is less than or equal to 6 and even, the maximum value for `i` in the loop is limited by `l`. This indicates that the loop has not yet reached the maximum possible value of `i`, which is `l`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently less than `l`, it can continue to iterate by generating combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be increased to `i + 1`.**
