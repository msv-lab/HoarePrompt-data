According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `l` to 10 with a step of 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l`, which is an even number less than 10. 

Since `l` is less than 10, the next value of `i` for the next iteration will be `l + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than 10. Thus, if `l` is any even number less than 10 (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), the next value of `i` will be valid unless it reaches 10, at which point the loop would terminate.

Therefore, `i` will be updated to `l + 2`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, and `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's such that their counts are equal.**
