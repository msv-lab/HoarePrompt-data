The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of the current `ans` (which is 4444477777) and `tem` (which is 77). Since 77 is less than 4444477777, `ans` will be updated to 77. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is `l`, `x` is '77', `tem` is 77, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is `l`, `x` is '77', `tem` is 77, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**.
