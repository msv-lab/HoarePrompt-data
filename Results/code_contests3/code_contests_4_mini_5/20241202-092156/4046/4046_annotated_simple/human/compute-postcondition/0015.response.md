The `ans` variable is assigned the minimum value between its current value (77) and `tem`, which can be 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774 depending on the value of `l`. Since `tem` is always greater than 77, the minimum will remain 77. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is either 3, 5, 7, or 9 depending on `l`; `x` corresponds to '777', '77774', '777774', or '77777774' for respective `l` values; `tem` is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is either 3, 5, 7, or 9 depending on `l`; `x` corresponds to '777', '77774', '777774', or '77777774' for respective `l` values; `tem` is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774.**
