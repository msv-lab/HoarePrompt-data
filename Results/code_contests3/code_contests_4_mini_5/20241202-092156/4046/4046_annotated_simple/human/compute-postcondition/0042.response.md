The loop generates all combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, counts the occurrences of '7' and '4', and updates `ans` to the minimum value of itself and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n` and the counts of '7' and '4' are equal.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, considering that `n` is a positive integer and `l` is an even number less than 10, the output state will reflect the final value of `ans` after potentially updating it based on the combinations generated.

If there are valid combinations where the counts of '7' and '4' are equal, `ans` will be the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such combination meets the criteria, `ans` will remain as its initial minimum value.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`.**
