The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output is based on the positive integer `n`, which is constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since the function does not take `n` as an input parameter, it likely relies on a different mechanism to determine its value or utilizes a predefined constant. The specific output of the function is not provided, so we cannot detail what it returns based on the value of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is dependent on a positive integer n within the range of 1 to 10^9, though the exact output is not specified.**
