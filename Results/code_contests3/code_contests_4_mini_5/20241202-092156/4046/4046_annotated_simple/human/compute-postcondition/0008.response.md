`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is '77', so `''.join(x)` results in '77', and converting this to an integer gives `tem` the value 77. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is '77', and `tem` is 77.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is '77', and `tem` is 77**
