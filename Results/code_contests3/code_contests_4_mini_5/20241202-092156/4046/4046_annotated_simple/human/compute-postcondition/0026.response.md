Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, `x` is the first combination generated by the loop, which is the combination of '7's and '4's with equal counts, and the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`.***
