The code assigns the value of `tem` to the integer formed by joining the elements of `x` as a string and then converting it to an integer. The variables `n`, `l`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation. However, the specific value of `x` is not provided, so `tem` will depend on the contents of `x`. Since `x` is not specified, we cannot determine a specific value for `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's; `tem` is the integer formed by the joined elements of `x`.**
