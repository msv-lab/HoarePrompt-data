The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. However, since `n` is already a positive integer satisfying the condition `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, its value will be replaced by the new integer input. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer as inputted, satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
