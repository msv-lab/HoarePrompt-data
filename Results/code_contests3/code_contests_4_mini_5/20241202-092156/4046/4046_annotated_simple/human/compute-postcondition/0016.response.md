Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is either 3, 5, 7, or 9 depending on `l`; `x` corresponds to '777', '77774', '777774', or '77777774' for respective `l` values; `tem` is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the conditions and values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `tem` remain as described.***
