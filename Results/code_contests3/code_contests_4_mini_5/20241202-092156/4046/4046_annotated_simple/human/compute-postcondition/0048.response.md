The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is formed by the integer representation of a string `x`, which has been defined such that it consists of an equal number of '7's and '4's. Since `tem` is also guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `n`, the value of `ans` may or may not change depending on its current value relative to `tem`. 

However, as the exact previous value of `ans` is not specified, I can only assert that the operation is performed. Therefore, the output state remains dependent on the original condition that `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`, where `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
