Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` from input, calculates the smallest integer composed of equal numbers of the digits '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`, and prints this integer. If no such integer is found, it defaults to printing `4444477777`. The function does not accept any parameters. **
