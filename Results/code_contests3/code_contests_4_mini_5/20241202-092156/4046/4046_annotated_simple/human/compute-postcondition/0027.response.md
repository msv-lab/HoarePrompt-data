The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is the first combination generated by the loop, consisting of an equal number of '7's and '4's. The specific value of `tem` depends on the composition of `x`, which is formed by concatenating the digits in `x` and converting that string to an integer. The values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i` are not directly changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `tem` based on the contents of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, `x` is the first combination generated by the loop, and `tem` is the integer value formed by joining the digits in `x`.**
