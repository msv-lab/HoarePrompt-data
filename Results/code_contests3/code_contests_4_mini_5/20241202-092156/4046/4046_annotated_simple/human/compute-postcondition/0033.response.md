`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a list of characters that are combined into a string and then converted into an integer. The values of `n`, `l`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is set to `l + 3`, and `tem` is the integer value derived from `''.join(x)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is set to `l + 3`, `tem` is the integer value derived from `''.join(x)`.**
