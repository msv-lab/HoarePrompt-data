The code `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is already defined as the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or remains 4444477777 if no such combination is found. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State includes the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, or remains 4444477777 if no such combination is found, `i` is 10, and `x` is not defined as the loop completes; `ans` is printed.**
