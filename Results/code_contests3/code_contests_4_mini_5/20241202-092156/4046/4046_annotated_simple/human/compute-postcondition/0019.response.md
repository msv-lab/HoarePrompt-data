The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means it converts the list `x` into a string by joining its elements and then converting that string into an integer. Since `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, the specific value of `tem` depends on how many of each digit is in `x`. Given that `tem` corresponds to either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774 based on the value of `l`, we can conclude that `tem` will take one of these values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `tem` is assigned one of those specific integer values, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is 4 or 6 or 8 or 10 depending on its previous value, `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, `tem` is either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774.**
