Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, and `i` is either 3, 5, 7, or 9 depending on `l`. If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, then `tem` corresponds to either 777, 77774, 777774, or 77777774 based on the value of `l`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`, `x`, and `tem` remain unchanged.***
