Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, and `tem` is an integer value derived from `''.join(x)`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4', and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. There is no else part in the code.***
