Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 77, `i` is `l`, and `x` is '77'. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is set to 77, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function retains these values. Otherwise, there is no else part.***
