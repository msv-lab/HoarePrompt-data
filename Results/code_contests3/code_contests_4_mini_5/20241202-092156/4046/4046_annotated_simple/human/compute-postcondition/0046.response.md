The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. Here, `x` is a string formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's, which means it consists of characters '7' and '4'. The specific arrangement of these characters in `x` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. However, we know that the resulting integer `tem` will be formed by concatenating these characters and converting them to an integer.

Since `x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot ascertain the specific value of `tem` but we know it will be some integer formed by '7's and '4's.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 4`, and the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, and `tem` is formed by the integer representation of the concatenated string `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 4`, and the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`; `tem` is formed by the integer representation of the concatenated string `x`.**
