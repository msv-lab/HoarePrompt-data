Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, and `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If the string `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, then `tem` is assigned the integer value of the joined string `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
