Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is the integer formed by the joined elements of `x`. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.***
