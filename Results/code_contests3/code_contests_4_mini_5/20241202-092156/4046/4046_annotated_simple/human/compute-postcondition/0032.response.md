According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the cartesian product generated by `x`. The loop will execute as long as the product generates combinations for the given value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to `l + 2`, where `l` is an even number less than 10. 

Since `l` is even and less than 10, the possible values for `l` could be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, leading to potential values for `i` being 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. The loop will generate combinations of '7' and '4' repeated `i` times. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be increased to `l + 3`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is set to `l + 3` for the loop to execute a second time.**
