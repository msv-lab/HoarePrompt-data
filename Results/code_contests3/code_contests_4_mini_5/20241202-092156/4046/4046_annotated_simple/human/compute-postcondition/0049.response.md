Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, and `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and `tem`.***
