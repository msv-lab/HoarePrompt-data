The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this line of code, but the value of `ans` may change depending on the comparison between `ans` and `tem`. Since the specifics of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, we can only state that `ans` will take the minimum of the two values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by an equal number of '7's and '4's; `tem` is the integer formed by the joined elements of `x`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
