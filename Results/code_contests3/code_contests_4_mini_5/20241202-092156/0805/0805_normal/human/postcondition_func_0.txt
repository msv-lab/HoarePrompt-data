The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each letter in `strings` by `n` positions forward in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning after 'Z'. The transformed string is printed but not returned. The function does not handle the case of invalid inputs or provide any return values.
