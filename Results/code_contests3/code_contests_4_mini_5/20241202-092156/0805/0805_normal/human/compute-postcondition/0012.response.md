The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are known from the initial state, where `n` is an input integer in the range of 0 to 26, and `index` is the integer value representing the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`. Therefore, `added_index` will be the sum of these two variables. 

The output state will reflect the calculated value of `added_index` based on the values of `index` and `n`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining; `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'; `new_strings` is the string formed by appending `new_s`; `index` is the integer value representing the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.**
