The variable `new_strings` is updated by concatenating it with `new_s`, which is determined based on the calculation of `new_index` and the character from `letters`. The values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates that `new_strings` is appended with the new character `new_s`. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least one character remaining; `index` is the position of character `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is the character from `letters` at `new_index`; `new_strings` is updated by concatenating `new_s`.**
