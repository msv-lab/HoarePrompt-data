The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `N` remains unaffected, as does the string `S`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer**
