To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we start by analyzing the impact of the code on the variables.

1. `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`. 
2. `added_index` is defined as `index + n`.
3. `index` is the position of character `s` in `letters`.
4. `letters` is presumably a string of uppercase English letters (A-Z).
5. `new_s` is assigned the character from `letters` at the `new_index`.

Since `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer between 0 and 26, and `n` is an input integer, we can conclude the following:
- `new_index` will always be a valid index for the string `letters`, as it is derived from the modulo operation with 26.
- The character `new_s` will correspond to the character at the calculated `new_index` in `letters`.

Thus, the output state summarizes the relationships and assignments described above.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least one character remaining; `index` is the position of character `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is the character from `letters` at `new_index`.**
