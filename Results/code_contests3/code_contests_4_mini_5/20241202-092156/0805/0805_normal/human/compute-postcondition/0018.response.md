The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The values of `index` and `n` are known: `index` is the position of character `s` in `letters` and `n` is an input integer such that 0 <= N <= 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be equal to the current value of `index` plus the input integer `n`. The output state will reflect the current values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `index`, and the new calculated value of `added_index`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least one character remaining; `index` is the position of character `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.**
