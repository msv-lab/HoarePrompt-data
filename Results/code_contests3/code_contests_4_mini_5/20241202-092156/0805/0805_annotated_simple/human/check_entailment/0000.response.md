Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S`. It correctly handles the input format described, where `N` is the first input followed by the string `S`.

2. **Character Shifting**: 
   - The program uses the string `letters` which contains all uppercase English letters in order. 
   - For each character in the input string `S`, it finds the index of that character in `letters`. 
   - It then calculates the new index by adding the shift `N` to the current index and using modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around correctly (i.e., after 'Z', it goes back to 'A').
   - The new character corresponding to the new index is then appended to the result string `new_strings`.

3. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the new shifted string, which matches the output requirements outlined in the problem statement.

4. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints effectively:
   - The program ensures that `0 <= N <= 26` is valid by the input structure.
   - It also correctly processes strings of length up to 10,000 characters without any performance issues due to the straightforward iterations.

Overall, the program meets all the specified requirements and handles the shifting of characters correctly, including wrapping around from 'Z' back to 'A'. Therefore, it is correct as per the problem description.
