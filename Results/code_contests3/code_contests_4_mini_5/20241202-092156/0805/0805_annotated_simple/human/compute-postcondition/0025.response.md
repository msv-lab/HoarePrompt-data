Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `S` of uppercase English letters. It shifts each letter in `S` by `n` positions in the English alphabet, wrapping around after 'Z' if necessary, and outputs the resulting string. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or where the integer input is out of the specified bounds.**
