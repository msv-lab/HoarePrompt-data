The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` was previously calculated as `index + n`. Since `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` (which is assumed to be a defined string of uppercase English letters) and `n` is an input integer with the constraint that 0 <= N <= 26, the value of `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. 

As we don't have the specific previous values of `index` and `n`, we can only deduce that `new_index` will be some integer in the range from 0 to 25 (inclusive), based on the modulo operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least 2 characters, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is equal to `index + n`, and `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`, which is in the range of 0 to 25.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least 2 characters, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is equal to `index + n`, `new_index` is in the range 0 to 25.**
