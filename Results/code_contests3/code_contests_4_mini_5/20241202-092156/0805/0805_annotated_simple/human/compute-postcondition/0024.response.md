The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `N`. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\). The length of `S` is between 1 and 10,000 characters. 

The function does not explicitly return any value in the provided output, so we need to determine the functionality based on the constraints and relationships given.

Since no specific output behavior is described, we can summarize the accepted parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `N` within the range of 0 to 26.**
