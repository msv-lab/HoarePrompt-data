The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `N` remains unchanged, and the string `S` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, and `n` is an input integer.**
