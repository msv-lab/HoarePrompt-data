To analyze the provided code snippet, we note the following:

- `added_index` is defined as `index + n`, and `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`.
- Since `added_index` is derived from `index` and `n`, and given that `n` is an input integer in the range from 0 to 26, `new_index` will be a result of the modulo operation, ensuring it remains within the range 0 to 25.

The calculation of `new_index` does not change the values of any other variables directly, but it will determine the letter `new_s` in `letters` based on the new index.

Since we do not have the specific values of `index`, `n`, or `added_index`, we can only describe how `new_index` is derived. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `new_index`.

Output State: **`new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`**
