`new_s` is appended to `new_strings`. The value of `new_s` is derived from `letters` at the index `new_index`, which is calculated as `added_index % 26`. The previous values of `new_strings` and `new_s` are not specified, but `new_strings` now includes `new_s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the value from `letters` at the unknown index `new_index`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.

Output State: **`new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the value from `letters` at the unknown index `new_index`, and `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.**
