`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The variable `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, but we don't have the value of `added_index` provided. Therefore, the value of `new_index` is unknown, and consequently, the value of `new_s` is also unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is the value from `letters` at the unknown index `new_index`.

Output State: **`new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`; `new_s` is the value from `letters` at the unknown index `new_index`.**
