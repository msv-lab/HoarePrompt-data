The `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is dependent on the values of `index` and `n`, but the exact values of these variables are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, `new_index` will be a value between 0 and 25, corresponding to the modulus operation with 26. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
