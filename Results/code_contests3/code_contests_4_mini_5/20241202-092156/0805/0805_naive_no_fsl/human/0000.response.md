Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to shift each character of the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order while handling the wrap-around from `Z` to `A`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S` as input, which matches the problem description.

2. **Character Shifting**: 
   - It constructs a string of uppercase English letters `letters` for reference.
   - For each character `s` in the input string `S`, it finds the current index in the `letters` string and adds `N` to this index.
   - The modulus operation (`% 26`) ensures that if the shifted index exceeds 25 (the index for `Z`), it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.

3. **Output Construction**: The shifted characters are concatenated to form the final result, which is then printed.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The case where `N = 0` is handled correctly by returning the original string `S`.
   - The case where `N = 26` also results in the original string, as shifting by 26 positions returns each character to its original position.

5. **Efficiency**: The program operates in O(|S|) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraint \(1 \leq |S| \leq 10^4\).

Since the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and handles potential edge cases correctly, I conclude that it is correct.
