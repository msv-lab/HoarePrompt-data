Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly shifts each character in the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order of uppercase English letters. It handles the wrap-around from `Z` to `A` appropriately using the modulo operation (`% 26`). 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S`.
2. It initializes a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
3. For each character in the input string `S`, it finds its index in the `letters` string.
4. It calculates the new index by adding `N` to the original index and then applying modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around correctly.
5. It constructs the new string by concatenating the characters corresponding to the new indices.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting shifted string.

The logic correctly handles all edge cases, including:
- Shifting by `0` (the output should be the same as the input).
- Shifting by `26` (which also results in the same string, as there are 26 letters).
- Wrap-around for letters near the end of the alphabet.

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
