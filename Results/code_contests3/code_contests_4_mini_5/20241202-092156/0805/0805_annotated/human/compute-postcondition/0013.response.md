To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the existing variables:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `new_strings` is increased by the value of `new_s`, where `new_s` is the character at position `new_index` in `letters`.
   - `s` is the second character of `strings`.
   - `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.
   - `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `new_index = added_index % 26` calculates the new value of `new_index` by taking the modulo of `added_index` with 26. This operation ensures that `new_index` wraps around if it exceeds 25 (the maximum index for a list of 26 letters).

3. **Impact:**
   - The variable `new_index` is assigned a new value based on the calculation involving `added_index`. The other variables (`new_strings`, `new_s`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`) remain unchanged in this line.

Thus, we conclude that while `new_index` is updated, the other variables hold their previous values.

Output State: **`new_strings` is increased by the value of `new_s`, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, and `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`.**
