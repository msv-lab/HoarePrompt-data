Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= 26), then shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around from 'Z' to 'A' as necessary. It prints the resulting transformed string. The function does not handle invalid input cases, such as if the input string contains characters outside the uppercase English letters or if `n` is outside the specified range. **
