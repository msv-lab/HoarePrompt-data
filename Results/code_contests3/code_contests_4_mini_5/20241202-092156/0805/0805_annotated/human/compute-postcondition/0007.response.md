The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is determined by the previous calculation of `index + n`. Since `index` is the index of the character `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer within the range of 0 to 26, the effect of this code is to compute the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. This will yield a new index that effectively maps the result back into the range of the letters.

Therefore, the output state captures the relationships and transformations of the variables involved. Assuming all variables maintain their previous states except for `new_index` which is derived from `added_index`, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
