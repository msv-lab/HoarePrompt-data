The value of `new_strings` is increased by the value of `new_s`. The states of the other variables (`s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, while `s`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, while `s`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` remain unchanged.**
