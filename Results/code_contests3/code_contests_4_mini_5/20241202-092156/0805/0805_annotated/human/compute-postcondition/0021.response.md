The value of `new_strings` is incremented by `new_s`. Since `new_s` has been previously assigned a value, `new_strings` now holds its previous value plus this new string. The states of the other variables (`strings`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `letters`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, `strings` has at least one more string, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is now `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is assigned the value from `letters[new_index]`.
