The value of `index` is assigned the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`. Since `s` is the second character of `strings`, its value is determined by that character, and `letters` must contain `s` for the `index()` function to return a valid position. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` is increased by the value of `new_s`, where `new_s` is the character at position `new_index` in `letters`, `s` is the second character of `strings`, and `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.

Output State: **`new_strings` is increased by the value of `new_s`, where `new_s` is the character at position `new_index` in `letters`, `s` is the second character of `strings`, and `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.**
