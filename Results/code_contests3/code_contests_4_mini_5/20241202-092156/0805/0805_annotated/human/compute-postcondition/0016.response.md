According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `strings`. If `strings` has at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_strings` has been increased by `new_s`, while `s`, `index`, `added_index`, and `new_index` remain unchanged. Since `s` represents the current string in the iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to be the next string in the `strings` list. If `index` was pointing to the current string, it must now be incremented by 1 to point to the next string.

State: **`new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, for the loop to execute a second time `strings` must have at least one more string, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is increased by 1, `added_index` and `new_index` remain unchanged**
