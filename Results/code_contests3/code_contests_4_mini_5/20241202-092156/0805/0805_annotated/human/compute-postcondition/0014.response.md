To determine the output state, we will analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

1. `new_s` is assigned the value `letters[new_index]`.
2. The variable `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is `index + n`.
3. The `index` represents the position of `s` (the second character of `strings`) in `letters`.

Given that `new_index` has already been defined in the initial state, `new_s` will be assigned the character from `letters` at the position of `new_index`.

The other variables (`new_strings`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`) remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `new_s` based on the computed `new_index`.

Output State: **`new_strings` is increased by the value of `new_s`, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`, `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`.**
