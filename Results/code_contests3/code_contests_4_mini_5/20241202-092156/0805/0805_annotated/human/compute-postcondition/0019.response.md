The value of `added_index` is assigned a new value derived from `index + n`, and `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`. The previous state of `new_index` remains unchanged. The specific values of `index` and `n` are not provided, but the outcome of the calculation will depend on their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, `strings` has at least one more string, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is now `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

Output State: **`new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, `strings` has at least one more string, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is now `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
