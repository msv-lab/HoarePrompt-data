The variable `new_s` is assigned the value from `letters` at the position `new_index`. The value of `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`. Since `added_index` is derived from `index + n`, where `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, the value of `new_s` will depend on `letters` and the values of `index` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `new_strings` is increased by `new_s`, `strings` has at least one more string, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is assigned the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is now `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is assigned the value from `letters[new_index]`.
