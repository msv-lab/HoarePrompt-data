To understand the impact of the code, we note the following:

1. `a` is a list of integers derived from splitting the input string `N`. The values in `a` are integers between 1 and 100 based on the input string.
2. `np.max(a)` computes the maximum value from the list `a`.
3. `np.min(a)` computes the minimum value from the list `a`.
4. `np.abs(...)` takes the absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a`.

Thus, the variable `ans` is assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a`.

Output State: **`N` is an input string value between "1" and "100"; `a` is a list of integers from `N`; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.**
