The value of `N` is assigned from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input. The initial state specifies that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `raw_input()` does not affect the list `a`, the output state will reflect that `N` is now an input string value that will later need conversion to an integer. 

Output State: **`N` is an input string value between "1" and "100", `a` is a list of N integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 1000**
