Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Explanation of Issues:
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). If this code is intended for Python 2, it should be noted, but since the context suggests Python 3, it is incorrect.

2. **Data Type Issues**: The input values for `a` are read as strings and not converted to integers. When calculating the maximum and minimum using `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)`, it will not work correctly because `a` needs to be a list of integers, not strings. This will lead to incorrect results.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The calculation of the distance `ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` is conceptually correct in terms of finding the distance between the farthest two houses. However, it relies on the aforementioned issues with input handling and data types.

4. **Output Requirement**: The problem requires the result to be printed as an integer (the minimum distance), but if the input handling is incorrect, it will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to meet the problem description due to input handling and type conversion issues, which can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is not correct as per the requirements stated.
