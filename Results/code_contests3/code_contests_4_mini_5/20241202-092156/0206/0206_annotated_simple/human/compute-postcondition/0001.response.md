The value of `a` is assigned the result of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input as a string, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to `a`. The variable `N` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Since `a` will contain `N` elements, these will be strings representing integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings.**
