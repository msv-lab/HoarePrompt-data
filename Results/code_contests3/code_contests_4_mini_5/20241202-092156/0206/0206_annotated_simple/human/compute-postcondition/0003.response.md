The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values in the list `a`. Since `ans` has already been calculated based on the previous state of `a`, there are no changes to the variables after this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum string values in `a`.**
