Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `a`, where each integer is between 0 and 1000. It calculates and prints the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. However, the function does not return any value or handle cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., if `N` does not match the number of integers provided in the list). **
