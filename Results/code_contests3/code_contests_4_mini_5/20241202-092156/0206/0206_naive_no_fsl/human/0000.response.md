Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the input properly. Specifically, the program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3; it should use `input()`. Additionally, the values in `a` are read as strings and need to be converted to integers before performing calculations. 

Furthermore, the logic to calculate the minimum distance is also flawed. The problem states that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions, which means we should calculate the distance from the minimum house position to the maximum house position. The calculation `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` only finds the distance between the farthest houses, but it does not account for the possibility of starting and ending anywhere, which could lead to cases where the distance is less than the distance between the farthest houses.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 3 5 7
```
The expected output is `5`, but if the values were `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` instead of the farthest houses, the output would be incorrectly calculated as `4` instead of `6` if the program logic were to be adjusted accordingly, demonstrating that the code does not cover all cases. 

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not process inputs correctly and does not accurately calculate the distance needed based on the problem's requirements.
