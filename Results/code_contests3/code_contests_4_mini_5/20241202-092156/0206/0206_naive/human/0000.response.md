Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum distance to be traveled as per the problem description. The issue arises from how the program calculates the distance. It uses `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`, which computes the distance between the farthest two houses but does not account for the fact that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any position. 

For example, consider the input:
```
N = 1
a = [5]
```
In this case, the minimum distance should be `0` since there is only one house, and AtCoDeer doesn't need to travel anywhere. However, the program would produce an incorrect output of `0` (since the distance between max and min would be `5 - 5`), which is not covered correctly by the logic as it does not account for the case when there is only one house. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the input correctly because `raw_input()` is not defined for Python 3 (it should be `input()`), and it uses NumPy without import, which would result in errors.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
