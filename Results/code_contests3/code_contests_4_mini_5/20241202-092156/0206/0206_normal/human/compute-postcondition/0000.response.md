The value of `N` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which takes user input as a string. Since `N` must remain an integer from the range 1 to 100, the value of `N` will still be represented as a string after this assignment. The other variables `a_i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a string input representing an integer, and `a_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000 for i = 1 to N.

Output State: **`N` is a string input representing an integer, and `a_i` are integers such that 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000 for i = 1 to N.**
