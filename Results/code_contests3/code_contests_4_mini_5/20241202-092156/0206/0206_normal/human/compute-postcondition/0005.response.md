The function `func` accepts an integer `N`, which should be between 1 and 100, and reads a list of integers `a_i` from user input, where each integer is expected to be between 0 and 1000. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a_i` and prints this value. However, the function does not handle any potential errors related to user input, such as invalid values or insufficient numbers in the list. As a result, if the input does not meet the specified constraints, the function may raise an error or produce unintended behavior. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` and a list of integers `a_i`, calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list, and prints this difference. It does not handle input validation or potential errors for user input. **
