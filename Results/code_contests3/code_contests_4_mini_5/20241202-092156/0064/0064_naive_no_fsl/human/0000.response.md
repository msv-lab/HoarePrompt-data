To analyze the program, we need to evaluate whether it accurately determines the initial bet size \( b \) based on the final coin counts of the players as described in the problem statement.

Here's the provided program:

```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

### Breakdown of the Logic

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. This is done using `raw_input()` and `map(int, ...)`.
  
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total number of coins \( s \) by summing the list of integers.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If \( s \) is 0, it prints `-1`. This condition checks if all players have zero coins, which implies no initial bet was made.
   - If \( s \) is not divisible by the number of players (which is always 5), it prints `-1`. This checks if the total coins cannot evenly distribute into the initial bets, implying that the outcome is not feasible.
   - If neither condition is true, it calculates the initial bet \( b \) by dividing \( s \) by 5 (the number of players).

### Evaluation of the Logic

The following points need to be considered:

- The initial bet \( b \) must be a positive integer. The program only returns valid \( b \) values when \( s \) is positive and divisible by 5.
- If all players end up with zero coins, the sum \( s \) will be zero, resulting in a correct output of `-1`, which indicates that no initial bet was made.
- If \( s \) is positive but not divisible by 5, the output is `-1`, which is correct because you can't have fractional bets.

### Test Cases

1. **All players have zero coins**:
   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Program Output: `-1` (Correct)

2. **Players have coins summing up to a number not divisible by 5**:
   - Input: `4 5 9 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Program Output: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Players have coins summing up to a positive number divisible by 5**:
   - Input: `2 5 4 0 4`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Program Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Edge case with maximum coins**:
   - Input: `100 100 100 100 100`
   - Expected Output: `100`
   - Program Output: `100` (Correct)

5. **Case where no valid \( b \) exists**:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly handles all the cases provided in the problem description, and the logic checks ensure that only valid scenarios are accounted for, I find no instance where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
