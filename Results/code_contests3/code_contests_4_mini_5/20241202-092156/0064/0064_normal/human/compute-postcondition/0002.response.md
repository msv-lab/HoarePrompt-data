To determine the output state, we first need to calculate the sum `s` of the integers in the list `c`, which consists of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. 

1. **Calculate `s`:**
   - `s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`

2. **Check conditions:**
   - If `s == 0`, print `-1`.
   - If `s % len(c) != 0`, print `-1`.
   - Otherwise, print `s / len(c)`.

Assuming `len(c)` is 5 (since there are 5 players), we check the above conditions based on the calculated `s`.

The output state will depend on the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.

Output State: **`s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`; print `-1` if `s == 0` or `s % 5 != 0`, otherwise print `s / 5`.**
