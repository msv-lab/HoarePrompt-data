Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here are the key issues that demonstrate its incorrectness:

1. **Initial Bet Calculation**: The problem description states that each player makes an initial bet of `b` coins and we need to determine this value based on the final number of coins each player has. However, the program calculates the average number of coins per player instead of finding the initial bet `b`. The average does not necessarily reflect the initial bet unless all players end up with the same number of coins, which is not guaranteed.

2. **Check for Positive Initial Bet**: The program checks if the total number of coins `s` is zero or if `s` is not divisible by 5, and prints `-1` in such cases. While checking for a total of zero is correct (since it implies players cannot have made a positive bet), the check for divisibility is insufficient. It fails to consider that the average (which could be zero or negative in other scenarios) does not ensure that all players could have started with the same initial bet `b`.

3. **Incorrect Output for Valid Cases**: The program does not account for cases where players might have different amounts of coins after playing the game. It always attempts to return the average, which may not be a valid initial bet `b`. For example, if one player has 10 coins and the others have zero, the average would be 2, which is incorrect as the initial bets cannot yield this configuration of coins.

In summary, the program fails to accurately determine the initial bet `b` based on the final states of the players, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements.
