The function accepts no parameters and reads five integers representing the number of coins each of five players has. It calculates the total number of coins and checks two conditions: if the total is zero (indicating all players are bankrupt) or if the total is not evenly divisible by five. If either condition is true, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the average number of coins per player. The function does not identify the player with the highest number of coins, contrary to what the annotations suggest.
