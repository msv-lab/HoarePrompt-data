The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on five integer variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, which represent the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game. Each of these integers must satisfy the constraint that they are non-negative and do not exceed 100. 

The function's output can be described in the following cases:

Case_1: If all players have 0 coins (i.e., `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are all 0), the function returns a message indicating that all players are bankrupt.

Case_2: If at least one player has more than 0 coins, the function returns the player with the highest number of coins along with the corresponding number of coins.

Thus, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate the coin counts of five players and determine if they are bankrupt or to identify the player with the highest number of coins.

Functionality: **The function evaluates the coin counts of five players and returns a message if all players are bankrupt or identifies the player with the highest number of coins.**
