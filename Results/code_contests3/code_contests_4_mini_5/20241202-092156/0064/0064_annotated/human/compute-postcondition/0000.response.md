The variable `c` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes the input by splitting it into separate string components, converting each string to an integer, and then mapping those integers into a new iterable. The previous values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are not affected directly by this line of code. The final values of `c` will depend on the input provided by the user.

Therefore, the Output State is: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` remain unchanged, and `c` holds the mapped integers from the input.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` remain unchanged; `c` holds the mapped integers from the input**.
