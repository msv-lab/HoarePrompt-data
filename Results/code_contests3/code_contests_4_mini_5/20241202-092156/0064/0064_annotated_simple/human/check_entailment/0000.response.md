Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`:** The function uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. The correct function should be `input()`.

2. **Handling of Input:** The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split())` to read the input, but it does not unpack the values into separate variables for `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`. Instead, it treats them as a single iterable, which can lead to incorrect calculations.

3. **Calculation of `b`:** The program calculates the total number of coins `s` and attempts to determine the initial bet `b` by dividing the total by the number of players. However, this logic is incorrect because:
   - The sum of the coins at the end (`s`) must be equal to `5 * b` for some positive integer `b`. The program simply checks if `s % len(c) != 0`, which is not sufficient to determine if a valid positive integer exists. 
   - The program does not ensure that `b` is a positive integer, as it can incorrectly output `0` if `s` is `0`, which contradicts the requirement that each player has a non-zero initial bet.

4. **Output Format:** The program does not return `b` as a positive integer or `-1` appropriately based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The output logic does not fully cover all cases, particularly when `s` is not divisible by `5` or valid positive `b` cannot be derived.

Overall, the program fails to faithfully implement the logic required to determine whether a valid initial bet exists and to output the correct result.
