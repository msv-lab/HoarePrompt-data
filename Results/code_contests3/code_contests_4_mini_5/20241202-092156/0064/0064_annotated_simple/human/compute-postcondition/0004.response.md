The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads a line of input representing the number of coins held by five players, each represented as an integer. It then calculates the total sum of coins across all players and evaluates specific conditions based on this sum. If the total sum is zero (indicating all players have no coins), it prints `-1`. If the sum is not divisible by the number of players (which is five), it also prints `-1`. If the total sum is divisible by five, it calculates and prints the average number of coins per player. 

The function does not explicitly handle cases for determining if there is a clear winner or a tie, nor does it check if at least one player is out of coins beyond simply checking if the total is zero. 

Functionality: ** The function reads the number of coins from five players, calculates the total, and prints `-1` if the total is zero or not divisible by five; otherwise, it prints the average number of coins per player. **
