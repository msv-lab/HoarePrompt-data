To evaluate the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state.

Initial State: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has at the end of the game; `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`.

1. Calculate `s`: 
   - `s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`.

2. Check the conditions in the print statement:
   - The expression checks if `s == 0`. If true, it returns `-1`.
   - If `s` is not equal to zero, it checks if `s % len(c) != 0`. Here, `len(c)` is `5` (the number of players). If this condition is true, it also returns `-1`.
   - If both conditions are false, it returns `s / len(c)` which is `s / 5`.

The output depends on the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, but since we don't have specific values for these variables, we analyze the possible outcomes based on the conditions.

Output State: **`s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`; output is -1 if `s` is 0 or `s` is not divisible by 5, else output is `s / 5`.**
