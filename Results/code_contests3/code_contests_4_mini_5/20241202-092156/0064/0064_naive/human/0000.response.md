To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Description:
We need to find the initial bet `b` that each of the five players made, given the final number of coins each player has. If no such `b` exists, we should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads the input, sums the coins each player has, and determines if the total can be evenly divided by the number of players (which is 5).

```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program accepts 5 integers representing the coins each player has.
2. **Summation**: It calculates the total number of coins `s`.
3. **Logic to Determine `b`**:
   - If `s == 0`, it prints `-1`, which is correct since if all players have 0 coins, they can't have made a positive initial bet.
   - It checks if `s % len(c) != 0`. Since `len(c)` is always 5, this checks if `s` is divisible by 5. If not, it returns `-1`, which is correct as it implies that the total cannot be split evenly among the players.
   - If both checks pass, it divides `s` by `len(c)` to find `b`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Division by Zero**: The program correctly checks if `s == 0` before performing the modulo operation, thus avoiding division by zero.
2. **Positive Bet Requirement**: The program does not check if `b` is positive after calculating `s / len(c)`. If `s` is less than 5 (which can happen if players have fewer than 5 coins collectively), it could yield a `b` that is not positive. For example:
   - If the input is `1 1 1 1 1`, then `s` is `5`, and the output would be `1`, which is valid.
   - However, if the input is `0 0 0 0 4`, then `s` is `4` and `b` would be `0.8`, which is not allowed since `b` must be a positive integer.
   
   This situation highlights that the program fails to handle the edge case where the total number of coins is less than 5.

### Conclusion:
Given that there are potential inputs that could lead to incorrect outputs, specifically when the total number of coins is not enough to allow for a positive initial bet, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

A counterexample could be the input `0 0 0 0 4`, which would yield an incorrect output of `0.8` instead of returning `-1`.
