The program provided does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that returns the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, while the code provided attempts to determine if a string is a palindrome after processing it to remove non-alphabetic characters and converting it to lowercase. 

Upon examining the code:
```python
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
```
The code is fundamentally unrelated to the requirements of the original problem. It does not generate or return any palindrome numbers, let alone the n-th even-length palindrome number. Instead, it checks if a given string is a palindrome, which is a completely different task.

Additionally, the output hints further clarify that the function works with strings and checks for palindromes, not integers or even-length palindromes.

Therefore, since the code fails to meet the specifications of the problem description in all cases, the correctness is as follows:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not address the problem of finding even-length palindrome numbers, which is the fundamental requirement of the task.
