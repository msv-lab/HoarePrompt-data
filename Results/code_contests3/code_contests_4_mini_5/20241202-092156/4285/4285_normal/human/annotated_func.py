#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True, since the empty string is equal to its reverse, which is also an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `n`, processes it to remove all non-alphabetic characters, converts it to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards). It returns True if the processed string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The annotations incorrectly describe `n` as a positive integer; it should be noted that `n` is actually a string.
