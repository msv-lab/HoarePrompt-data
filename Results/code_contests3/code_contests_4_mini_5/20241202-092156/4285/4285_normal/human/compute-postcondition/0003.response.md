Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, processes it to remove all non-alphabetic characters, converts it to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards). It returns True if the processed string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. The annotations incorrectly describe `n` as a positive integer; it should be noted that `n` is actually a string.**
