The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. It returns True if the filtered string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. It does not handle cases where `n` may be an empty string initially, which would also result in a True return value since an empty string is considered a palindrome.
