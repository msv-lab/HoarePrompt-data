#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True since an empty string is equal to its reverse, confirming that x is a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. It returns True if the filtered string is a palindrome, and False otherwise. It does not handle cases where `n` may be an empty string initially, which would also result in a True return value since an empty string is considered a palindrome.
