Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that finds the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, but the program instead checks if a given input string (that is assumed to be `n`) is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and comparing the string to its reverse.

Here are the specific issues:

1. The function `func_1` is not designed to compute the n-th even-length palindrome number. Instead, it processes the input `n` as a string, attempts to filter it for alphabetic characters, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. This is entirely unrelated to generating even-length palindromic numbers.

2. The output of the function is a boolean value indicating whether a string is a palindrome, rather than returning the n-th even-length palindrome number as required by the problem.

3. The problem description specifies that `n` will be a positive integer, but the program does not properly handle `n` as an integer input for generating the required palindrome number.

In conclusion, the program fails to implement the functionality described in the problem statement and does not return the correct output for the given problem.
