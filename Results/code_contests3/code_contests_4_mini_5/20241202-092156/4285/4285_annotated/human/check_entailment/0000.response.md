Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description. The problem requires a function that calculates the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, which should be a numeric output based on the input integer `n`. 

However, the provided program:

1. Takes an input `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer but is treated as a string.
2. It attempts to create a new string by filtering out non-alphabetical characters from `n`, which is irrelevant since `n` should be a number.
3. It checks if this filtered string is a palindrome, which is not related to finding the n-th even-length palindrome number.

Thus, the program does not address the core requirement of generating even-length palindromes based on the input `n`, nor does it provide the correct output format or logic to achieve that. The actual implementation needed would involve generating palindromes by concatenating digits appropriately rather than checking strings for palindromic properties. Therefore, the program fails to meet the specifications of the problem description.
