The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000. After executing the function body, it returns `True` if the string representation of `n` is equal to its reverse, confirming that it is a palindrome. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` if the string representation of `n` is a palindrome. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns True if the string representation of n is a palindrome.**
