#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True because an empty string is equal to its reverse, confirming that it is a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it to its string representation, removes all non-alphabetical characters, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, returning True if it is and False otherwise.
