Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that returns the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. However, the program `func_1` takes a single input `n`, which is expected to be an integer, but instead processes `n` as a string and checks if it is a palindrome. 

For example:
- If the input is `1`, the expected output is `11`, but the program does not compute this value.
- If the input is `10`, the expected output is `1001`, but again, the program does not provide this functionality.

The logic of checking if a string is a palindrome does not relate to finding even-length palindromic numbers at all. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
