Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not address the problem description at all. The problem asks for a program that computes the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, while the given code instead checks if a string (specifically `n`, which is expected to be an integer) is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetical characters and comparing it to its reverse.

1. The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes `n` is a string containing alphabetic characters, which is not applicable in this context since `n` should be an integer.
2. The program does not generate or return any palindrome numbers, let alone the n-th even-length palindrome number.

For example, if the input is `1`, the expected output should be `11`, but the program will not produce any output related to palindromes at all. Hence, it fails to meet the requirement of the problem description.
