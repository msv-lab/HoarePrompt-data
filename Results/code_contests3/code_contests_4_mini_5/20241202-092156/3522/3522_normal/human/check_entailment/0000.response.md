To evaluate the correctness of the given program against the provided problem description and output hints, let's analyze each component step-by-step.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The task is to represent a given positive integer `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. If such a representation is not possible, the program should return -1. A composite number is defined as a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime.

### Code Analysis:
The provided program reads multiple queries and processes each integer `a` as follows:

1. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments a counter `c` by 1.
2. It checks if the adjusted value of `a` is in the set of specific small primes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it returns -1.
3. If `a` is not one of the specified primes, it returns the result of `a / 4 + c`, using integer division.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Small Values of `a`:** 
   - For `a = 1, 2, 3`, the program correctly returns -1 since these values cannot be represented as sums of composite numbers.
   - For `a = 4` and `a = 5`, the program also returns -1, which is correct since these numbers cannot form composite sums either.

2. **Odd Values of `a`:**
   - If `a` is odd and less than 9 (e.g., `a = 1, 3, 5, 7`), subtracting 9 will yield negative results which are not valid.
   - For `a = 9`, it will return 1, which is incorrect since 9 cannot be expressed as a sum of composites.

3. **Even Values of `a`:**
   - The program handles even values by calculating `a / 4`. However, it does not take into account that not all even numbers can be expressed as sums of composite numbers. For instance, `a = 6` returns 1, which is correct as 6 can be expressed as `4 + 2`, but `4` can be represented as `2 + 2`, making it ambiguous.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function does not explicitly handle cases where `a` is less than 9 correctly. This aligns with our observations, especially concerning odd numbers and small values.

### Conclusion:
The program exhibits several flaws:
- It fails to return the correct maximum number of composite summands for values like `9`.
- The logic does not account for all possible scenarios of composite summands adequately, particularly for odd numbers and small integers.
- The check against small primes is not comprehensive enough to ensure that all composite splits are accounted for.

Because the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and has clearly defined examples where it fails, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
