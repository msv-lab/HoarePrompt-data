`a` is assigned the value of `a - 9`. The previous value of `a` is an input value, which could be any number, but we are not provided with a specific value to calculate. The other variables, `c` and `output`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a new input value minus 9, `c` is 0, and `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.

Output State: **`a` is a new input value minus 9, `c` is 0, `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5**
