The value of `c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, so after execution, `c` is now 1. The values of `a` and `output` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a new input value minus 9, `c` is 1, `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.

Output State: **`a` is a new input value minus 9, `c` is 1, `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5**
