The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is a positive odd integer and at least 1, the new value of `a` will still be a positive integer after the subtraction. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0, and `q` is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a positive integer that is odd and at least 1 after being decreased by 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a positive odd integer after being decreased by 9; `c` is 0**
