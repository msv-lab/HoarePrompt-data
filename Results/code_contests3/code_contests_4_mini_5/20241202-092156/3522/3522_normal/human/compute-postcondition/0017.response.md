The value of `c` is assigned 0, replacing its previous value of 1. The variable `output` remains unchanged and can still be either -1, 2.25, or 2.5. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a new input value, `c` is 0, `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.

Output State: **`a` is a new input value, `c` is 0, `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5**
