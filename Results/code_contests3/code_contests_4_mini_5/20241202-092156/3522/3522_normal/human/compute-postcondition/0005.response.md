The variable `c` is assigned the value of 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, but now it updates to 1. The values of the other variables `q` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a positive odd integer after being decreased by 9; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a positive odd integer after being decreased by 9; `c` is 1**.
