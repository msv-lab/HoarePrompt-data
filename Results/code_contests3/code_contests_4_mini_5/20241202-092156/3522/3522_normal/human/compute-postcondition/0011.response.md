`a` is assigned the value `a - 9`. The value of `a` can be either 9, 10, or 11. Therefore, after the execution, the possible values of `a` will be 0, 1, or 2. The values of `c` and `output` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is either 0, 1, or 2; `c` is 0; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.

Output State: **`a` is either 0, 1, or 2; `c` is 0; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5**
