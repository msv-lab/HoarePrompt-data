The variable `c` is assigned the value `1`, which changes its previous value of `0`. The variables `a` and `output` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is either 0, 1, or 2; `c` is 1; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.

Output State: **`a` is either 0, 1, or 2; `c` is 1; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5**
