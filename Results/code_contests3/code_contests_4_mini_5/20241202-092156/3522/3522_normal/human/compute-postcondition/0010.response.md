The value of `c` is assigned the value 0. The previous value of `c` could have been either 0 or 1, but it is now definitively 0. The values of `a` and `output` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is either 9, 10, or 11; `c` is 0; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.

Output State: **`a` is either 9, 10, or 11; `c` is 0; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5**
