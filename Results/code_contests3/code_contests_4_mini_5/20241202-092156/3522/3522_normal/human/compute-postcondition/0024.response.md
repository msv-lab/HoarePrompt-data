Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries and processes each query `a` (a positive integer). For each query, if `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments a counter `c`. It then evaluates `a`: if `a` is one of the specific small primes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the integer division of `a` by 4 plus `c`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `a` is less than 9 correctly, as the logic may lead to unexpected results, and it lacks checks for input validity beyond the given constraints.**
