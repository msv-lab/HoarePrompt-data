The function `func` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a positive integer constrained by \(1 \leq q \leq 10^5\). Additionally, the function processes a series of queries denoted as `ni`, where each `ni` is a positive integer constrained by \(1 \leq ni \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the output is based on the results of these queries, though the specific output details are not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter q (a positive integer between 1 and 100,000) and processes a series of queries (ni, each a positive integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000), returning results based on these queries.**
