Let's analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

Initial State: `a` is either 9, 10, or 11; `c` is 0; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5. If `a` is odd (specifically 9 or 11), then `c` is set to 1, while `output` remains either -1, 2.25, or 2.5. If `a` is even (specifically 10), there are no changes to `c` or `output`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. We check if `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. The only value in the initial state that satisfies this condition is `11`.
2. If `a` is `11`, the code will execute the first part of the print statement, which is `- 1`.
3. The state of `c` was initially `0`, but since `a` is odd (11), `c` would be set to `1`. However, this does not affect the output since the output is determined by the `print` statement.

Based on these evaluations:
- For `a = 11`, the output will be `-1`.
- The final values of the variables will be:
  - `a` is 11,
  - `c` is 1,
  - `output` remains either -1, 2.25, or 2.5 (but is not used in this calculation).

Output State: **`a` is 11; `c` is 1; `output` is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5; printed value is -1**.
