To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code while considering the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; if `a` is an odd positive integer after being decreased by 9, then `c` is set to 1. If `a` is not an odd positive integer, `c` remains 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

Now, let's break down the potential scenarios based on the value of `a`:

1. **If `a` is an odd positive integer after being decreased by 9**: 
   - This means `a` could be one of the following values (since odd integers that are positive after subtracting 9 must be at least 9):
     - `a = 9`, then `c = 1`
     - `a = 11`, then `c = 1`
   - `a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`: This is true for `a = 11`.
     - In this case, the output will be `-1`.
   - For `a = 9`, the condition is false, and we evaluate `9 / 4 + 1 = 2.25`.

2. **If `a` is not an odd positive integer after being decreased by 9**:
   - For example, if `a` is an even positive integer like `10`, then `c = 0`.
   - `a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`: This is false for `a = 10`.
     - In this case, the output will be `10 / 4 + 0 = 2.5`.
   - If `a` is less than `9` but still an odd integer, `c` remains `0` and the output would be `a / 4 + 0`.

Without specific values for `a`, we cannot definitively conclude the output. However, based on the analysis:

- If `a = 11`, **Output State**: **`a` is 11, `c` is 1; output is -1.**
- If `a = 9`, **Output State**: **`a` is 9, `c` is 1; output is 2.25.**
- If `a = 10` (or any even positive integer), **Output State**: **`a` is 10, `c` is 0; output is 2.5.**

Since the question does not specify a value for `a`, I will provide a generalized output state.

Output State: **`a` is either 9, 10, or 11; `c` is 0 or 1; output is either -1, 2.25, or 2.5.**
