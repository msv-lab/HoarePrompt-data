To analyze the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the logic of the code and check its correctness concerning the requirements outlined.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to determine how many composite summands can be used to express a given positive integer \( n_i \). The conditions are:
- If \( n_i \) is less than the smallest composite number (which is 4), it should return -1.
- For even integers greater than or equal to 4, the maximum number of composite summands can be calculated.
- For odd integers, we need to subtract 9 (the smallest odd composite number) before checking the remaining number.

### Analyzing the Code
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

### Issues in the Code
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The use of `xrange` is Python 2 syntax, which may lead to compatibility issues in Python 3.
   - The program uses `input()` directly without converting it to an integer, which can cause type errors.

2. **Composite Number Check**:
   - The program checks if \( a \) is in the set of small numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to return -1. However, it does not handle all composite checks accurately.
   - Specifically, the return value for \( a \) being 4, 6, 8, etc., is not correctly calculated. For instance:
     - For \( n_i = 6 \), the output should be 1 (since 6 can be expressed as 4 + 2 but only one composite summand).
     - For \( n_i = 8 \), it should return 2 (since 8 can be expressed as 4 + 4).

3. **Division Operation**:
   - The division operation `a / 4` should be an integer division `a // 4` to avoid floating point results when working with integers.

### Counterexample
- For \( n_i = 6 \):
  - The current implementation will result in `-1` since \( 6 \) is in the list (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) after performing `a = a - 9` (which makes it -3, not valid).
- The expected output for \( n_i = 6 \) should be 1, as it can be expressed as 4 + 2.

### Conclusion
Because the program fails to account for valid cases of composite summands and incorrectly processes some inputs, it does not meet the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
