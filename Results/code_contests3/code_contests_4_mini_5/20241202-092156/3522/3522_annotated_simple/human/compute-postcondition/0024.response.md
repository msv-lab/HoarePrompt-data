Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `q` which represents the number of queries. For each query, it takes a positive integer `a`. If `a` is odd, it is decremented by 9 and a counter `c` is set to 1. The function then checks if the modified or original `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If it is, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the result of `a / 4 + c`. Therefore, it processes each query and outputs either -1 or a computed value based on the input integer. **
