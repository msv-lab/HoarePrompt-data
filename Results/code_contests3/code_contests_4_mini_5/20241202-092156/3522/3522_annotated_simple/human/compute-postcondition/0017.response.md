The value of `c` is reassigned to 0. The previous value of `c` was 1, but now it changes to 0. The states of the other variables (`q` and `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string, `c` is 0**
