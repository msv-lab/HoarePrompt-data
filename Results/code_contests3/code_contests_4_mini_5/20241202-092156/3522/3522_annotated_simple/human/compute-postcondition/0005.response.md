`c` is assigned the value of 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string (odd), `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string (odd), `c` is 1**
