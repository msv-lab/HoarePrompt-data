The function `func` accepts a parameter `q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries. For each query, it accepts a parameter `ni`, which is also a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq ni \leq 10^9\). The output of the function is determined by processing these queries, but the specific behavior or results of the function based on the values of `q` and `ni` are not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries and for each query a positive integer `ni` constrained between 1 and \(10^9\). The function processes these queries and returns results based on them.**
