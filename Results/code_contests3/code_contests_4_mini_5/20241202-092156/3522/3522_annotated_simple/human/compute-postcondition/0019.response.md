The value of `c` is assigned the value 1, which updates its previous value of 0. The values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string minus 9, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is an input string minus 9, `c` is 1**
