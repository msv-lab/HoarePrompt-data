To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the given Python code snippet in relation to the initial state.

1. Given that `a` is an input string, we need to check if `a` is odd or even:
   - If `a` is odd (`a % 2 != 0`), then `a` will be updated by subtracting 9, and `c` will be set to 1.
   - If `a` is even, then `a` and `c` remain unchanged.

2. The code includes a conditional to print either `-1` if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or calculates `a / 4 + c`.

Since the values of `a` and `c` are contingent upon the input string for `a`, we cannot specify exact numeric outputs without knowing the value of `a`.

However, since `q` is a positive integer greater than 1 and not directly used in the print statement, it does not affect the output.

The output will depend on the provided input for `a`. The possible outcomes are as follows:

- If `a` is odd and results in a value in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output is `-1`.
- If `a` is odd and not in the set, the output will be `(a - 9) / 4 + 1`.
- If `a` is even and in the set, the output is `-1`.
- If `a` is even and not in the set, the output will be `a / 4 + 0`.

Since we do not have a specific value for `a`, we cannot provide a definitive output state. However, the output state can be described in terms of the conditions.

Output State: **`a` is an input string, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a` is even or odd; the output will be -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or calculated based on the value of `a`.**
