`c` is assigned the value of `0`. The values of `q` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than 0; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0.  
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than 0; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0**
