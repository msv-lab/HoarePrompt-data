To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the program functionality.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The program must handle multiple queries. Each query consists of a positive integer \( n_i \).
2. The goal is to express \( n_i \) as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands.
3. If it is not possible to express \( n_i \) as such a sum, the output should be -1.
4. A composite number is defined as a positive integer greater than 1 that is not prime, meaning it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Program Analysis:
1. The first line of the program reads the number of queries.
2. For each query, the program reads an integer \( a \).
3. If \( a \) is odd, it subtracts 9 from \( a \) and sets a counter \( c \) to 1.
4. The program checks if \( a \) is in the set \( (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) \). If it is, it prints -1.
5. If \( a \) is not in that set, it calculates the maximum number of composite summands as \( a / 4 + c \).

### Key Issues:
1. **Handling of Odd Numbers**: The program subtracts 9 from any odd number. This may lead to incorrect results since it doesn't guarantee that the resulting number is composite. For example, if \( a = 15 \), it becomes 6, which is composite, but if \( a = 13 \), it becomes 4, which is also composite, but if \( a = 9 \), it becomes 0, which is invalid.
   
2. **Composite Check**: The condition checking if \( a \) is in \( (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) \) is a rigid check that may miss valid composites or wrongly classify composite numbers. For instance, it would not properly handle cases like \( a = 10 \), where 10 can be expressed as \( 4 + 6 \).

3. **Output Calculation**: The formula \( a / 4 + c \) does not accurately represent the maximum number of composite summands that can be formed. For example, \( a = 8 \) yields \( 8 / 4 + 0 = 2 \), which is correct, but for \( a = 12 \), it yields \( 12 / 4 + 0 = 3 \), which is also correct. However, the logic of how to derive the maximum summands might not hold for edge cases or larger numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not properly identify the maximum number of composite summands for every possible \( n_i \). The rigid checks against a hardcoded set of small numbers may lead to incorrect outputs for larger composite numbers that can still be split into valid summands.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
