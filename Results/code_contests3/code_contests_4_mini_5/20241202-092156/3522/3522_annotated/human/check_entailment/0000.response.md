Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why it is incorrect:

1. **Handling of Odd Numbers**: The program only subtracts 9 from odd numbers and increments the counter `c` by 1. This approach does not correctly address how to maximize the number of composite summands. For example, if `a` is 15 (odd), it subtracts 9 to make `a` equal to 6, and then calculates the output as `6 / 4 + 1`, which is 2. However, 15 can actually be expressed as the sum of three composite numbers (for example, 4 + 4 + 7), which the program fails to account for.

2. **Incorrect Output for Even Numbers**: The program checks if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} to return -1. This is incorrect because it does not consider all composite numbers. For instance, for an input of 4 (which is composite), the program would return `4 / 4 + 0 = 1`, which is correct, but for other even numbers like 10 (which can be decomposed into two composites, 4 + 6), it fails to give the maximum summands.

3. **Output Calculation**: The formula `a / 4 + c` does not necessarily yield the maximum number of composite summands. The function should be designed to explore various combinations of composite numbers to find the maximum count rather than relying on a fixed formula. For example, 12 can be expressed as 4 + 4 + 4, yielding three summands, but the program may not correctly compute this in its current form.

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Checks**: The program does not comprehensively check for all possible composite summands, especially for large values of `a`. It should ideally implement a more systematic way to explore all possible combinations of composites rather than limiting itself to the checks it currently performs.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the problem description as it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of composite summands for all possible inputs, leading to incorrect outputs in multiple scenarios.
