The value of `c` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `c` was `0`, but other variables (`q`, `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `c` is 1**
