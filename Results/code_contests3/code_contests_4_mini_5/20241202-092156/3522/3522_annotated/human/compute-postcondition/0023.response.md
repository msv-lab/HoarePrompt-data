The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. Instead, it internally handles a positive integer `q`, which represents the number of queries, and a series of positive integers `ni`, each of which satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9. 

The function processes these queries and returns specific results based on the conditions applied to each `ni`. However, since the output is not specified in the provided details, we cannot determine the exact return values or cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer q representing the number of queries and a series of positive integers ni, each between 1 and 10^9, and processes these queries to return results based on the conditions applied to each ni.**
