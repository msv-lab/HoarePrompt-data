The value of `a` is assigned `a - 9`. Since `a` is an odd number, subtracting 9 from it will yield another odd number. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an odd number minus 9, `c` is 0. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an odd number minus 9, `c` is 0**
