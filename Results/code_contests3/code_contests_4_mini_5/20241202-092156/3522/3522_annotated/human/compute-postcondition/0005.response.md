The value of `c` is assigned the value 1, changing its previous value of 0. The variables `q` and `a` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an odd number minus 9, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an odd number minus 9, `c` is 1**
