According to the code, the for loop iterates based on the value from `input()`, which indicates how many times the loop will run. The variable `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, indicating that there is at least one iteration left. 

At the end of the last iteration, `q` is still positive, meaning there are more iterations to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `q` must be reduced by 1. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `q` will be decreased by 1, and the loop will continue based on the updated value of `q`.

State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `q` must be greater than or equal to 1 (specifically it will be reduced to at least 1)**
