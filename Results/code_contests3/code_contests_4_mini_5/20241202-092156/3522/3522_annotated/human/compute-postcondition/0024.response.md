Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries, and for each query processes a positive integer `a`. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets `c` to 1; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0. The function then checks if `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} and returns -1 in that case. If not, it returns the value of `a / 4 + c`. This function handles a series of queries and modifies the output based on the conditions applied to each input integer. Edge cases include handling very small values of `a` and ensuring that the function properly calculates results for both odd and even integers.**
