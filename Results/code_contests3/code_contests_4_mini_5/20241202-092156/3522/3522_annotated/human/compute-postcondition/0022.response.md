The loop processes `q` queries, each reading a positive integer `a`. If `a` is odd, it is reduced by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if even, `c` remains 0. The output is determined based on whether `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or calculated as `a / 4 + c`.

If the loop executes `q` times, the output will reflect the results of these operations for each input `a`.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, each `a` is a positive integer input, `c` is 1 for odd `a` and 0 for even `a`, and the final output for each query is either -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.**
