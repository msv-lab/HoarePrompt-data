To analyze the code snippet, we first note the variables and their initial conditions:

- `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `a` is an input string.
- `c` is set to 1 if `a` is an odd number; otherwise, `c` remains 0.

The code snippet is:

```
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. The condition checks if `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`.
2. If `a` is in that tuple, it will print `-1`.
3. If `a` is not in that tuple, it will compute `a / 4 + c`.
4. Since `a` is initially stated to be an input string, we assume `a` can be converted to an integer for the division. 

Based on the above logic:

- If `a` is one of the numbers in the tuple, the output will be `-1`.
- If `a` is not in the tuple, we need to evaluate `a / 4 + c`. The value of `c` depends on whether `a` is odd or even.

Therefore, we consider two scenarios based on the input:

1. If `a` is an integer from the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be `-1`. 
2. If `a` is another integer, we would compute `a / 4 + c` where `c` would be determined by the odd/even nature of `a`.

Since we cannot know the exact value of `a` without more information, we summarize the output state for both cases.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input string; `c` is 1 if `a` is odd or 0 if `a` is even; the output will be -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.**
