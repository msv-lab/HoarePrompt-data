The value of `c` is assigned the value of 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, so now `c` changes to 1. The other variables, `q` and `a`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input string, `c` is 1**
