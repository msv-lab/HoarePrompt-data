To determine whether the provided program is correct based on the problem description, we first need to analyze the program's logic and its handling of different input cases.

The problem requires that for each integer \( n_i \), we should represent it as the sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands or return -1 if it's not possible. Composite numbers start from 4 (the smallest composite number).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of queries and then iteratively processes each integer.

2. **Odd Handling**: If the integer \( a \) is odd, it subtracts 9 from \( a \) and increments a counter \( c \) by 1. This is done to make \( a \) even, as the sum of composite numbers (which are mostly even) will be easier.

3. **Invalid Cases**: After adjusting \( a \), it checks if \( a \) is in the set \( \{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11\} \) which are not splittable into composite summands. If so, it returns -1.

4. **Calculating Summands**: If \( a \) is not in the invalid set, it calculates the number of composite summands as \( a / 4 + c \). Here, \( a / 4 \) gives the number of 4's that can be summed to reach \( a \).

### Testing Against Edge Cases:

1. **Minimum Input**: For \( n = 1 \), \( 2 \), \( 3 \) â€” The program correctly returns -1 as there are no valid composite summands.

2. **Low Composite Values**: For \( n = 4 \) and \( n = 6 \):
   - \( n = 4 \): Should return 1 (4 itself).
   - \( n = 6 \): Should return 1 (6 can be represented as 4 + 2, but 2 is not composite, hence the only valid is 6 itself which is not composite).

3. **Higher Values**: For larger even values:
   - \( n = 12 \): Correctly returns 3 as \( 4 + 4 + 4 \).
   - \( n = 8 \): Correctly returns 2 as \( 4 + 4 \).

4. **Odd Values**: For \( n = 15 \): 
   - The program will subtract 9, leaving 6, which is in the invalid set so it returns -1.

### Failure Case:

The program has a flaw when handling odd integers that are greater than 9:
- For \( n = 15 \) (or any odd number greater than 9), the program incorrectly returns -1 because it checks the modified \( a \) against the invalid set. However, \( 15 \) can actually be split into composite summands (like \( 4 + 4 + 7 \)). This means the program overlooks valid composite summands for odd numbers greater than 9.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly, particularly for odd integers greater than 9, where valid summands exist but are not identified due to early termination with -1.

Correctness: **False**
