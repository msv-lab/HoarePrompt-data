#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the printed output consists of integers from 1 to `N - 1` for the respective values of `n` during each iteration, totaling the integers from 1 to `N - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from input and prints the position of the least significant bit (1) in the binary representation of integers from 1 to `n-1`, but it lacks input validation and conversion, which may lead to runtime errors.
