The code prints the result of the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. Starting with the initial state, we know that `j` is 1.

1. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.

2. Convert this value to binary using `bin(2)`: 
   - The binary representation of 2 is `'0b10'`.

3. Reverse the string using `[::-1]`: 
   - Reversing `'0b10'` gives `'01b0'`.

4. Find the index of the first occurrence of '1' using `find('1')`: 
   - In `'01b0'`, the first '1' is at index 1.

5. Add 1 to this index: 
   - Therefore, `find('1') + 1` equals `1 + 1`, which is 2.

The output of the print statement will be `2`. The other variables `N` and `n` are not affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`N` is at least 3, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.**
