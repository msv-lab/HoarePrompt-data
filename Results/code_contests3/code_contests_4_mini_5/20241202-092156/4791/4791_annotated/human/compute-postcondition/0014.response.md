According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is `N - 2`, which is at least 1 since `N` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1.

Since `n` is `N - 2`, and for the loop to execute again, it must hold that `j` is less than `n`. Thus, after the next increment of `j`, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be at least 4 (because `n` must be at least 2 for `j` to be less than `n`).

State: **`N` is at least 3, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be at least 4.**
