According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is one less than `N`, which means `n` is at least 1 (since `N` is between 2 and 500). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is one less than `N`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
