The code snippet calculates the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and adds 1 to that position for the final output. Given that `j` is 1, the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.
   
2. Convert this result to binary: 
   - The binary representation of 2 is `10`.

3. Reverse this binary string: 
   - Reversing `10` gives `01`.

4. Find the index of the first occurrence of '1':
   - In the reversed string `01`, the first '1' is at index 1 (considering 0-based indexing).

5. Add 1 to the index found:
   - 1 (index) + 1 results in 2.

Therefore, the output from the print statement is 2. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`) remain unchanged and are not directly affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is 1, and the output from the print statement is 2.**
