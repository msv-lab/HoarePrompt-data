The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is initially one less than `N`, after the execution, `n` will be equal to `N - 2`. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged, with `j` still equal to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is `n`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is `n`**
