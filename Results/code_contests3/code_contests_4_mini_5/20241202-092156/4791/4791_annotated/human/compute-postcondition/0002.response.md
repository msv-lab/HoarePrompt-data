The value of `n` is decremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `n` is a non-empty string which means its previous value is unknown but it must be converted to an integer to perform the subtraction. After executing `n -= 1`, `n` would be an integer that is one less than its previous integer value derived from the non-empty string. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `n` is now an integer that is one less than its previous integer value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is an integer that is one less than its previous integer value**
