According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `n` is an input string, but we don't know if it is empty or not. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be a non-empty string**
