The variable `n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which is a string representation of the input provided by the user. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), but `n` will now hold a string value instead. The output state reflects that `n` is a string input. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string**.
