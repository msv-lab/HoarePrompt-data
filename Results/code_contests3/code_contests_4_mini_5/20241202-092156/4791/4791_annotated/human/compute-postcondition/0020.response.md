`n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is `N - 2`, so after execution, `n` will be `N - 3`. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged, and since `N` is greater than 2, the condition for the loop to execute again is still satisfied. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is `n - 1**
