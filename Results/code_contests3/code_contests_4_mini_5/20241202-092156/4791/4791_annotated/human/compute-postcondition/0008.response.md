The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position.

1. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.
2. The binary representation of 3 is `'0b11'`, which is `'11'` when considering only the digits.
3. Reversing the string gives us `'11'`.
4. The `find('1')` method returns the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is 0.
5. Adding 1 to the index results in `0 + 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is one less than `N`, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is one less than `N`, `j` is 2, and the output is 1.**
