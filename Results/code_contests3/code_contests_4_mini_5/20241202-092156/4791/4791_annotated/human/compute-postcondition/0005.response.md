According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is one less than `N`, which means `n` is at least 1 (because `N` is at least 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 since `j` will need to be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is one less than `N`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
