The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, we can infer that `N` may be referenced or used within the function body without being explicitly passed as an argument. 

Without additional information on the output functionality based on the value of `N`, we cannot determine specific return cases. If it were to return different values based on the value of `N`, those conditions would need to be specified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and may return values based on an internal integer N, which is expected to be between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Specific return values depend on the implementation details not provided.**
