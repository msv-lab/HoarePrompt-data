`j` is 0, so the expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The `bin` function converts this to the binary string representation, which is `'0b1'`. The slicing `[::-1]` reverses this string to `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` method looks for the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this result gives us 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed output is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed output is 1.**
