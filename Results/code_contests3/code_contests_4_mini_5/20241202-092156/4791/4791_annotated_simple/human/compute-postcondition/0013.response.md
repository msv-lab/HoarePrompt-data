The value of `j` is 0. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`, so `bin(j + 1)` results in `'0b1'`. The string `[::-1]` reverses this to `'1b0'`. The `.find('1')` method locates the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1. The `print` function outputs this value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed value is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the printed value is 1.**
