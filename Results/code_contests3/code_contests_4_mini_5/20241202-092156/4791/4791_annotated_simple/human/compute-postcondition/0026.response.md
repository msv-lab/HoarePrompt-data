The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

Given that `j` is 2, we first compute `j + 1`, which is 3. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. When reversed, this becomes `11`. The `find('1')` method will return the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this gives us 1.

The other variables, such as `N`, are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
