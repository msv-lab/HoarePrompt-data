According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for every integer from 0 to `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once. Given that `j` starts at -1 before the loop and will be incremented with each iteration, it will be 0 during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial value of `j` will be incremented to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
