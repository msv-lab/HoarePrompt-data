The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is computed. First, `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. Reversing this string results in '01'. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in '01', which is at index 1. Adding 1 to this index yields a final result of 2.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 1, and the computed output from the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 1, and the output is 2**.
