According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 0. Since `n` is currently non-zero (as it is at least 0 and printed values are all 1 for each integer from 1 to `n`), the loop can execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the printed values are all 1 for each integer from 1 to `n`.**
