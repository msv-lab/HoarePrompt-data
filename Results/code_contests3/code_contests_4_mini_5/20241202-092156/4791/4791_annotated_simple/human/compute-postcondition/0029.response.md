The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `N` is defined as an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The function's behavior and output are not explicitly detailed in the output section, so we cannot specify return values or conditions. Therefore, we can only describe the parameter constraint.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The specific return value or functionality is not detailed.**
