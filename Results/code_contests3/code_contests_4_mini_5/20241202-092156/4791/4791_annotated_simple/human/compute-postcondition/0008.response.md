The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated as follows:

1. `j` is given as 2.
2. Calculate `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.
3. Convert `3` to its binary representation using `bin(3)`, which results in `'0b11'`.
4. Reverse the string representation without the `'0b'` prefix, resulting in `'11'` when we slice the string from index 2 onward: `bin(3)[2:][::-1]`.
5. Use `.find('1')` to locate the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'11'`, which is at index `0`.
6. Finally, add `1` to this index, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`.

The output state includes the calculated result, and since no other variables are affected, we summarize the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string converted to an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 2; the result of the expression is 1.**
