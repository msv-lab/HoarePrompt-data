`n` is decremented by 1, so the new value of `n` becomes `n - 1`. The value of `j` was previously `n - 1`, but since `n` is now decreased by 1, `j` will now be equal to `n - 1 - 1` which simplifies to `n - 2`. The printed values remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and the printed values are all 1 for each integer from 1 to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and the printed values are all 1 for each integer from 1 to `n - 1.**
