According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero (i.e., a non-empty string converted to an integer that is at least 0). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 0 (since it is a non-empty string converted to an integer), but we need to ensure it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

Since `j` is `n - 1`, if `n` is currently 0, then `j` would also be -1, and the loop would not be able to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string converted to an integer that is at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and the printed values are the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each integer from 1 to `n`**
