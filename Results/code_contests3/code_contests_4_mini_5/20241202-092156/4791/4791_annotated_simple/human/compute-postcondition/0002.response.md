`n` is decremented by 1. The variable `N` is not directly affected by this operation, and since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` can be any non-empty string at the start of the loop. The specific value of `n` is not provided, but it is now reduced by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string and is now decremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string and is now decremented by 1.**
