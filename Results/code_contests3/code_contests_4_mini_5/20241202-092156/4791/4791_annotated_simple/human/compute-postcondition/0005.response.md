According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string converted to an integer and is at least 1, `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
