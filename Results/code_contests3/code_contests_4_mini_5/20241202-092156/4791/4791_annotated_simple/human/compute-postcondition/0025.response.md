According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `N` is an integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 1 (which it is), and `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
