The code prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and adds 1 to that position. Given that `j` is initially 1, `j + 1` is 2. The binary representation of 2 is '10'. When reversed, it becomes '01'. The position of the first '1' in '01' is 1 (considering 1-based indexing). 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 1.**
