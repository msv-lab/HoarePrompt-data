The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and adds 1 to that position. 

Since `j` is 0, `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of 1 is `1`. Reversing this gives us still `1`. The position of the first '1' in this reversed string is 0, but since we need to add 1, the result will be 1.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` is 0 and the calculated result is 1. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string that has been converted to an integer and is now at least 1, `j` is 0; the result of the print statement is 1.**
