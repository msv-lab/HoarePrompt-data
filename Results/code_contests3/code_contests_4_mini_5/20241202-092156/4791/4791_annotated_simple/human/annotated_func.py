#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the printed values are the positions of the least significant '1' bits for each integer from 1 to the original value of `n`, with the final output consisting of values based on the original input string's integer conversion.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from user input (expected to be between 2 and 500), then prints the position of the least significant '1' bit for each integer from 1 to `n`, decrementing `n` until it reaches 0. It does not return any value.
