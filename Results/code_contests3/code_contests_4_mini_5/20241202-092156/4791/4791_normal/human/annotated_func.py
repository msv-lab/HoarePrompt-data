#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The output should be a representation of the levels of passages between N rooms in a specific format.
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1 (the last value of `j` before the loop ended).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes a string input (assumed to be an integer) representing the number of rooms `N` (between 2 and 500 inclusive). It then calculates and prints the levels of passages between these rooms based on binary representations of numbers from 1 to N-1, specifically returning the position of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of each number. If the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range, the function does not handle such cases and may lead to unexpected behavior.
