According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is `N - 3`, with `N` being at least 4. Thus, `n` is at least 1 (since `N - 3` is at least 1).

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2. Given that `n` is `N - 3`, this means `N - 3` must be greater than 2, which leads to `N` needing to be greater than 5.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 5**
