The loop continues until `n` becomes 0. After executing the loop `N - 1` times, `n` will be decremented to 0. The variable `j` will take on values from `N - 2` down to 0 during the iterations. The printed output will correspond to the positions of the least significant '1' bits for numbers from 1 to `n`, reflecting the values of `j` during each iteration.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, the output state will be as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1 (the last value of `j` before the loop ended).**
