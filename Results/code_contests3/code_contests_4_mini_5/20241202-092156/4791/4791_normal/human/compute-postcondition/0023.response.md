According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is `N - 3`, where `N` is at least 4. This means `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
