`n` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is `N - 2`, which means `n` can take values ranging from 0 to 498, depending on the value of `N`. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, decrementing `n` will not affect the condition for the loop to execute again, as `N` remains greater than 2. Therefore, after this line of code executes, the states of the variables are: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 3`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is `N - 3`**
