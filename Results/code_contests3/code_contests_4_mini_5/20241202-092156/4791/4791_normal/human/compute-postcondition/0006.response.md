The code executes `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)`. 

1. First, we compute `j + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` equals 2.
2. Next, we convert this value to binary using `bin(2)`, which gives us the string `'0b10'`.
3. We then reverse this string using `[::-1]`, resulting in `'01b0'`.
4. The `find('1')` method is called on this reversed string, which searches for the first occurrence of '1'. It finds it at index 1.
5. Finally, we add 1 to this index, resulting in `1 + 1 = 2`.

The execution of the print statement does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output will reflect the calculated result based on the above steps.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the string representation of `N - 1`, `j` is 1, and the printed value is 2.**
