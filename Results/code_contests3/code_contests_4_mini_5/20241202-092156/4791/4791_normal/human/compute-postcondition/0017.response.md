The code snippet calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses that string, and then finds the index of '1'. 

1. `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.
2. The binary representation of 3 is `'11'`.
3. Reversing that string gives `'11'`.
4. The first occurrence of '1' (from the left) in `'11'` is at index 0, so `find('1')` returns 0.
5. Adding 1 to this result gives a final value of 1.

Since the code is a print statement, it does not affect the values of `N`, `n`, or `j`. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 2; the printed output is 1.**
