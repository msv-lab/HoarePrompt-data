In this code snippet, the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is executed. 

- `j` is initially 0.
- Therefore, `j + 1` evaluates to `1`.
- The binary representation of `1` is `'0b1'`, and when we take the slice with `bin(j + 1)`, we get `'0b1'`.
- Reversing this string with `[::-1]` gives us `'1b0'`.
- Next, we call `.find('1')` on the reversed string `'1b0'`, which returns `0`, because the first occurrence of `'1'` is at index `0`.
- Finally, we add `1` to this result, yielding `1`.

The output of the print statement would be `1`. 

The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged through this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the string representation of `N - 1`, `j` is 0; the print statement outputs `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is the string representation of `N - 1`, `j` is 0; the print statement outputs `1`.**
