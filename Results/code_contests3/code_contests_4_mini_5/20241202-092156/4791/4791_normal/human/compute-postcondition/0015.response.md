To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `N` is an integer between 2 and 500.
   - `n` is `N - 2`, which means `n` will be at least 0 (when `N` is 2) and at most 498 (when `N` is 500).
   - `j` is initialized to 1.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.
   - The `bin(2)` function converts `2` to a binary string representation, which is `'0b10'`.
   - The slice `bin(j + 1)[::-1]` reverses this string, resulting in `'01b0'`.
   - The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string, which is at index `1`.
   - Finally, we add `1` to the index found, resulting in `1 + 1 = 2`.

Since the values of `N`, `n`, and `j` do not change, and no variables are returned or modified through assignment in this code snippet, we summarize the output state:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 1; the result of the print statement is 2.**
