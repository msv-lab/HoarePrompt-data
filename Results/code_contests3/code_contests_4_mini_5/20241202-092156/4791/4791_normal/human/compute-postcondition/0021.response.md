According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is defined as `N - 3`, we need to ensure that `N - 3` is greater than or equal to 1, which means `N` must be at least 4. Since `N` is already stated to be between 2 and 500, we can set `N` to 4 or greater for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `j` will be at its final value, which will be `n - 1` (the last valid index in the range). 

For the loop to execute the first time:
- `N` must be at least 4.
- `n` will be `N - 3`, which will equal 1 when `N` is 4.
- `j` will start at 0 for the first execution.

State: **`N` is at least 4, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
