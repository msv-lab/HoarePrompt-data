The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` being a string representation of that integer means it will also represent a value between "2" and "500". After decrementing `n`, its value will be the string representation of `N - 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is the string representation of `N - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is the string representation of `N - 1**
