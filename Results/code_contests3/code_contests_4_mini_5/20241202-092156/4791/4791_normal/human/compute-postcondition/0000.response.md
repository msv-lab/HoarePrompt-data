`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts input as a string. Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` will be a string representation of that integer. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string representation of that integer.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string representation of that integer.**
