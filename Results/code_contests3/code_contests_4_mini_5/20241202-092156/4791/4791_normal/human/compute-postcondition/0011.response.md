`n` is assigned the value `n - 1`. Since `n` is the string representation of `N - 1`, this means we first need to convert `n` back to an integer to perform the subtraction. The previous value of `n` is `N - 1`, so after the operation, `n` becomes `N - 2`. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged, and since `N` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is now an integer representation of `N - 2`, `j` is `N - 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is now an integer representation of `N - 2`, `j` is `N - 2**
