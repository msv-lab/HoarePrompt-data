The function accepts no parameters and processes a string input (assumed to be an integer) representing the number of rooms `N` (between 2 and 500 inclusive). It then calculates and prints the levels of passages between these rooms based on binary representations of numbers from 1 to N-1, specifically returning the position of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of each number. If the input is not a valid integer or is outside the specified range, the function does not handle such cases and may lead to unexpected behavior.
