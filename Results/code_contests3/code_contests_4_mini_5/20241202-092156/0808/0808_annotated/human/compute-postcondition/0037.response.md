The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple datasets consisting of integers. Each dataset contains an integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`. After executing the function body, it will return results based on the processed datasets. The specific output behavior based on the datasets is not detailed here, but it implies it will handle up to 30 datasets of integers within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function processes up to 30 datasets of integers, each ranging from 1 to 999,999, and returns results based on these datasets.**
