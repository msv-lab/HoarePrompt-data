According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `i` and the range defined in the loop statement. The starting point of the range is `i ** 2 - 1`, which in this case is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration.

For the loop to execute a third time, the value of `j` after the first two iterations must still be less than 1,000,000. 

- In the first iteration, `j` starts at 8.
- In the second iteration, `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`.
- In the third iteration, `j` will be `11 + 3 = 14`.

Since `14` is still less than `1,000,000`, this condition is satisfied for the third iteration. 

The state of `a` does not affect the loop execution directly, and since `i` is already set to 3, it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be emphasized for the loop to execute are that `i` is 3, and `j` will start at 8, then 11, and finally 14 for the third iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False and all even indexed elements are True, `i` is 3, `j` is initially 8, then 11, and for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 14 which is still less than 1,000,000.**
