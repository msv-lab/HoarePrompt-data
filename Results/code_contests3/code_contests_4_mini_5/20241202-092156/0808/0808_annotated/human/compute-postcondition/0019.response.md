Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False and all even indexed elements that are not in the range 8 to 999,997 are True; if `a[i - 1]` is True, it indicates that `i` is in an even index and the value at that index is True. If `i` is 3, then `a[2]` is True.***
