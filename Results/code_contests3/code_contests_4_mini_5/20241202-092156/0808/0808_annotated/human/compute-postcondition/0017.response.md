The element at index `j` (which is 20) in the list `a` is assigned the value `False`. Since `a` is defined such that all even indexed elements are `True`, `a[20]` is currently `True`. After executing the code, `a[20]` will now be `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[20]` now being `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 20.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[20]` now being `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 20**.
