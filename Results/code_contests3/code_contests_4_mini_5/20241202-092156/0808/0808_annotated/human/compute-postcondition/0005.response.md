According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, and in the next iteration, `j` will be increased by `i` (which is 2). 

To find out the new value of `j` for the next iteration:
- The current value of `j` is 3.
- In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i`, so `j` will become 3 + 2 = 5.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the condition must still hold true that `j` is less than 1,000,000. Since 5 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements (where `a[3]` is now False), `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
