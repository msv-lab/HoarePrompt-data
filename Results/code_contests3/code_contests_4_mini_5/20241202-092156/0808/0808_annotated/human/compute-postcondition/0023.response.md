According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `j` is 15. The loop increments `j` by `i`, which is 4, for each iteration.

To determine the new value of `j`, we add `i` to the current `j` value:
- Current `j` is 15
- New `j` will be 15 + 4 = 19

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000. Since 19 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False, `i` is 4, `j` is 19, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
