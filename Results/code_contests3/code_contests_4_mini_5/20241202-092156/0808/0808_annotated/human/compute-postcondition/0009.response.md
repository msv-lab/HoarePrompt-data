The loop iterates over the elements of the list `a` starting from index `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 3) and marks every `i`-th element as `False`. Given that `i` is 2, the loop will mark all odd indices starting from 3 as `False`. 

After all iterations of the loop have finished, every second element starting from index 3 will be set to `False`, which includes all odd indices. The even indices will remain `True`. 

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False and all even indexed elements are True, `i` is 2.**
