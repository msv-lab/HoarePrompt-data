The value at index `j` in the list `a` is set to `False`. Given the initial state, `j` is 3, which means `a[3]` will be updated. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements (where `a[3]` is now False), `i` is 2, and `j` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements (where `a[3]` is now False), `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
