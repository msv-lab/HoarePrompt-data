The code assigns the value False to the element at index `j` in the list `a`. The previous state of `a[j]` is not specified, but it is being explicitly set to False. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements (where `a[3]` is now False), `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `a[5]` is now False.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements (where `a[3]` is now False), `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `a[5]` is now False.**
