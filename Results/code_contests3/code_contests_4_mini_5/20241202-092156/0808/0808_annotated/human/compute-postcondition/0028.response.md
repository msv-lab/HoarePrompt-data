Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `i` is 4 and `a` contains only even indexed elements that are True within the specified range, while odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False. If `a[i - 1]` is False, it indicates that `a[3]` is False for the loop to execute a fourth time, confirming that all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) remain False.***
