To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the information provided:

1. The loop is constructed as `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):`, which means:
   - The starting point of the range is `i ** 2 - 1`.
   - The ending point is `1000000`.
   - The step size is `i`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, the starting point for the current iteration can be calculated as:
   - `i ** 2 - 1 = 2 ** 2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

3. The loop iterates starting from `3`, increments by `2` (since `i` is 2), and continues as long as `j` is less than `1000000`.

4. Given that `j` starts at `3` and increments by `2`, the next values of `j` will be `3`, `5`, `7`, `9`, ..., up to `999999`.

5. The last value of `j` before the next iteration will be `j = 5` (as stated), and since `a[5]` is `False`, it indicates that the current execution of the loop has processed `j = 5`.

6. To execute one more time, the next value of `j` will be `7`. 

7. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `1000000`, which it still is for `j = 7`.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `7`.

The state needs to reflect the updated value for `j` while keeping `a` and `i` the same, as they do not change within the loop's execution.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements (where `a[3]` is now False, `a[5]` is now False), `i` is 2, `j` is 7, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1000000.**
