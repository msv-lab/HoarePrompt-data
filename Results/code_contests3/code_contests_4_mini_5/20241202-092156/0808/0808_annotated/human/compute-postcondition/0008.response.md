The value at index `j` of list `a` (which is currently 7) is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `a` indicates that `a[3]` and `a[5]` are already `False`, and now `a[7]` will also be `False`. The other variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False; `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
