The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in the list `a`. Given the initial state, `j` is `23`, which is even. The element at index `23` in the list `a` is currently `False` (as it's one of the odd indexed elements starting from index 3 that are set to `False`). Therefore, assigning `False` to `a[23]` does not change its value.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, and `a[23]` remains False.

Output State: **`a` is a list where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, and `a[23]` remains False.**
