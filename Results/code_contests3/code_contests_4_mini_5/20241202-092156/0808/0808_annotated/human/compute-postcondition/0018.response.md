To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the loop and its effects on the list `a`.

The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 3Â² - 1 = 8) and continues to set elements of `a` to False at intervals of `i` (which is 3). Therefore, the indices that will be set to False are as follows:

- Starting from index 8, the loop will set `a[8]`, `a[11]`, `a[14]`, `a[17]`, `a[20]`, ..., until it reaches 1,000,000.

We know from the provided output states after the first three iterations that:

- After 1st iteration: `j` is 14, `a[14]` is set to False.
- After 2nd iteration: `j` is 17, `a[17]` is set to False.
- After 3rd iteration: `j` is 20, `a[20]` is set to False.

To find the total effect of the loop on list `a`, we note that the loop will continue executing until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000. The increments of `j` are by `i` (3), starting from 8. Hence, the indices affected will be:

- 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ..., until the maximum index less than 1,000,000.

To find the last index, we can calculate how many times we can add 3 to 8 without exceeding 1,000,000:

The largest value of `j` can be calculated as follows:

1. Start at 8.
2. The last valid index can be calculated by finding the maximum `n` such that:
   - \( 8 + 3n < 1,000,000 \)
   - Solving for \( n \): 
     - \( 3n < 999,992 \)
     - \( n < 333,330.67 \)
   - Therefore, \( n \) can be at most 333,330.
3. Thus, the last index `j` will be \( 8 + 3 \times 333,330 = 1,000,000 - 3 \) = 999,997.

During the execution of the loop, all indices from 8 to 999,997 that are in the form of \( 8 + 3n \) will be set to False. 

Since the initial state of `a` has odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) as False and even indexed elements as True, after all iterations of the loop, the final output state will be:

- All elements at indices 8, 11, 14, ..., 999,997 will be False.
- Elements at odd indices (starting from 3) will remain False.
- Elements at even indices will remain True unless they fall in the affected range.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all odd indexed elements (starting from index 3) are False and all even indexed elements that are not in the range 8 to 999,997 are True; `i` is 3; the last `j` set to False is 999,997.**
