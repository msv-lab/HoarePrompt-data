The function reads multiple natural numbers (n) from standard input, where each n can range from 1 to 999,999, and counts the number of prime numbers less than or equal to each n. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to precompute a list indicating prime status for numbers up to 999,999, and prints the count of prime numbers for each input value. The function does not return any value directly.
