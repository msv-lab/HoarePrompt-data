You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a program which reads an integer n and prints the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to n. A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first four prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5 and 7.



Input

Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset has an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) in a line.

The number of datasets is less than or equal to 30.

Output

For each dataset, prints the number of prime numbers.

Example

Input

10
3
11


Output

4
2
5
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function reads multiple datasets consisting of integers n, where each n is a natural number such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and there are at most 30 datasets.
def func():
    a = [True] * 1000000
    for i in range(2, 1000000):
        if a[i - 1]:
            for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
                a[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are not prime, which are set to False.
    for s in sys.stdin:
        print(a[1:int(s)].count(True))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are not prime; the count of True values in `a` from index 1 to the maximum value received from `sys.stdin` is printed for each input value.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
