The value of `a[j]` is set to False. Since `j` is currently 7, `a[7]` is updated to False. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except `a[5]` and `a[7]` which are set to False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except `a[5]` and `a[7]` which are set to False; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
