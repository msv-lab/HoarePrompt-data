`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `j` is 14, so `a[14]` will be set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except `a[8]` is False, `a[11]` is False, and `a[14]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except `a[8]` is False, `a[11]` is False, and `a[14]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14**
