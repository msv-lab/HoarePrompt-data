According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and the range defined by `j`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1000000.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, which means that the loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 4) in each iteration. The last known value of `j` is 19.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we check the next value of `j`, which would be `19 + 4 = 23`. Since 23 is still less than 1000000, the loop can execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration where `j` will be 23.

State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 23; `a[23]` is True.**
