`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `a[23]` is `True`, so after execution, `a[23]` becomes `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 23; `a[23]` is False.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 23; `a[23]` is False.**
