Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True. If `i` is 2, then `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) evaluates to False, since all odd indices starting from 3 are set to False. Therefore, the if condition is satisfied as `a[i - 1]` is False. If `a[i - 1]` is True, it indicates that `i` could point to an even index, which are all set to True.***
