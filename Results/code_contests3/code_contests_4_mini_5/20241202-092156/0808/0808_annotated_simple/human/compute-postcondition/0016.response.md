According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 11, and `i` is 3. 

The loop starts at `j = i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`, and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration. 

Given that `j` is currently 11, for the next iteration, `j` will be updated to `11 + 3 = 14`. 

Since `14` is still less than `1000000`, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except `a[8]` is False and `a[11]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1000000.**
