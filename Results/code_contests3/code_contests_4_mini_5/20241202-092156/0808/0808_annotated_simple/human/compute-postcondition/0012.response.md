According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i`. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 999999, incrementing by `i` each time. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is already set to 3, which means the starting point of the loop is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 8 and incrementing by 3 until it reaches 999999.

To ensure the loop executes a second time, we need to verify the value of `j` after the first execution. The first iteration will set `j` to 8, then it will increment by 3 for the next iteration, making `j = 11` for the second execution. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, we must ensure that `j` remains less than 1000000, which is guaranteed because the loop starts at 8 and increments by 3.

State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 3, `j` starts at 8, for the loop to execute a second time `j` will be 11**
