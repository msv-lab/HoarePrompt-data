According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and the loop's starting point for the next iteration is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which equals 3. 

In the previous iteration, the loop starts at 3 and increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) on each iteration. Since `j` is currently 5, we need to calculate the next value of `j` for the loop to execute again. 

The next value of `j` will be 5 + 2 = 7. For the loop to execute once more, `j` must be less than 1000000.

State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True; `i` is 2; `j` is 7; `a[5]` is set to False; for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than 1000000.**
