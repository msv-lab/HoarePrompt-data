The value of `a[j]` is set to False. Since `j` is 19, the corresponding index in the list `a` will be updated to False. The previous state of `a` at index 19 was True, and now it is set to False. The values of `i` and `a` at other indices remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 19; `a[19]` is now False.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999999; `a[15]` is False; `i` is 4; `j` is 19; `a[19]` is now False.**
