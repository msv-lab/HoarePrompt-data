To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

The loop iterates over the range defined by `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000`, stepping by `i` (which is 4). The starting point for `j` is `4 ** 2 - 1`, which calculates to `15`. The loop will set the elements of the list `a` at index `j` to `False` for every fourth index starting from `15` until `1000000` is reached.

Each iteration of the loop modifies the list `a` by setting specific indices to `False`. 

1. In the first iteration, `j` is `15`, so `a[15]` is set to `False`.
2. In the second iteration, `j` becomes `19`, so `a[19]` is also set to `False`.
3. In the third iteration, `j` is `23`, so `a[23]` is set to `False`.
4. This process continues, with `j` incrementing by `4` each time until `j` is less than `1000000`.

The indices modified by the loop will be of the form `15 + 4k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer, until `j` reaches or exceeds `1000000`. 

The key points to note are:
- The list `a` will have all its elements set to `True` except for specific indices starting from `15` that are modified during the loop execution.
- The iterations will continue until `j` reaches the upper limit of `1000000`.

After considering all iterations of the loop, the output state includes:
- The list `a` with all elements set to `True`, except for indices that are multiples of `4` starting from `15` up to the largest `j` less than `1000000`.
- `i` remains `4` throughout.
- `j` will be the last value calculated before exceeding `1000000`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for specific indices `15, 19, 23, ..., up to the last index less than 1000000 that is of the form 15 + 4k`; `i` is 4; `j` is the last index calculated before exceeding 999999.**
