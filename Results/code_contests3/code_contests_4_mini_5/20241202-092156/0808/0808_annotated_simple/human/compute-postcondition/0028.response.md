Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for specific indices `15, 19, 23, ..., up to the last index less than 1000000 that is of the form 15 + 4k`; if `a[i - 1]` is True (which corresponds to `a[3]`), then the condition holds, and the program continues based on that state.***
