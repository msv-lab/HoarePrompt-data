The element at index `j` (which is 15) of the list `a` is assigned the value `False`. The other elements in the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a[j]`, while `a` retains its original structure except for the modified index.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True except for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 up to 999999; `a[15]` is now False; `i` is 4; `j` is 15.**
