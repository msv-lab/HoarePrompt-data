According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to 999999. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and we know that `a[1]` is False. Since `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is False, it indicates that `i` could point to an even index, which are all set to True. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will increment by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3.

At the next iteration, the loop will check `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[2]`. Since all even indices (including `a[2]`) are True, the loop can continue executing. 

State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be in the range 2 to 999999.**
