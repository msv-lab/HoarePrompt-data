The loop iterates over a range starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 3) up to 1,000,000, stepping by `i` (which is 2). During each iteration, the value at index `j` in the list `a` is set to False. Since `i` is 2, the loop will mark every second index starting from 3 as False. 

Given that `a` starts with all True values, after all iterations of the loop complete, the indices that will be set to False are all odd indices starting from 3 up to 999,999.

Output State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all even indices set to True and all odd indices (starting from 3) set to False; `i` is 2; `j` is 999999 or the last calculated value of j before reaching 1000000.**
