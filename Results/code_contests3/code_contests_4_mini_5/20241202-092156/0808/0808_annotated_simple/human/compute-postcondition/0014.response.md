According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 8. The next value of `j` will be calculated using the expression `j + i`, which results in `j` becoming 11 (8 + 3). 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than 1000000. Since 11 is less than 1000000, the loop can execute a second time. 

Thus, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True; `i` is 3; `j` is 11; `a[8]` is set to False**
