According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The range for the loop is defined as `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2, so `i ** 2 - 1` is `2 ** 2 - 1`, which equals 3.
- The loop will start from 3 and increment by 2 each time (since `i` is 2).

Currently, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be updated to the next value in the range, which would be `j + i`, resulting in `j` becoming 5 in the next iteration.

To summarize:
- At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3.
- The next value of `j` will be 5.
- The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than 1000000.

State: **`a` is a list of length 1000000 with all elements set to True; `i` is 2; `j` is 5; for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1000000.**
