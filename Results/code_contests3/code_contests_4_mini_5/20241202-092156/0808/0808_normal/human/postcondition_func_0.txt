The function reads up to 30 integers from standard input, each representing a value `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999). It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to determine which numbers up to 1,000,000 are prime, storing the results in a list. For each integer `n` read, the function counts and prints the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. The function does not return any value but outputs the count of primes for each input directly.
