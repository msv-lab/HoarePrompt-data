The value of `a[j]` is assigned to `False`, where `j` is currently 3. The initial state of the list `a` has all elements set to `True`, so after execution, the element at index 3 will be changed to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
