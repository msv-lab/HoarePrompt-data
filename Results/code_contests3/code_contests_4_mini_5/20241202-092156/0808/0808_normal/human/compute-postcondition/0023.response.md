According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute again if the current value of `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 1,000, and `j` is set to some value based on the previous iteration (specifically, `j` was set to `i ** 2 - 1` for the first iteration). 

To determine the state for the next iteration:
1. The starting value for `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`.
2. In order to execute the loop again, `j` must be updated to its next value, which will be `j + i`.
3. Since `i` is less than 1,000, the next value of `j` will still need to be less than 1,000,000 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, after the next iteration, `j` would be `i ** 2 - 1 + i`. 

To summarize:
- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000 after the next increment.
- Since `i` is less than 1,000, we can say that `j` will now be `i ** 2 + i - 1`.

Given this information, we can conclude:

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is less than 1,000, `j` is `i ** 2 + i - 1`, for the loop to execute a next time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
