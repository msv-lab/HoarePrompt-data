According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop is set to run as long as `j` is less than 1000000, and `j` is incremented by `i` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8, and `i` is 3. The starting value for the next iteration can be calculated as `j + i`, which is `8 + 3 = 11`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1000000. Since 11 is less than 1000000, the loop is valid for one more iteration. Therefore, we need to update the value of `j` to 11 for the next iteration.

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 11, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1000000**
