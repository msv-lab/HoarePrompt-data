The value of `a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Since `j` is 5, this means the element at index 5 of the list `a` is set to `False`. The previous value of `a[5]` is unknown, but it will now be `False`. The other variables (`i` and `a[3]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**.
