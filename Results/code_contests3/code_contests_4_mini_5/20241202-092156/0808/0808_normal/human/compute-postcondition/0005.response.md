According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 1,000,000 in steps of `i`. Currently, `i` is 2, so `i ** 2 - 1` is 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 5 (3 + 2).

We also need to check if this new value of `j` (5) is still less than 1,000,000. Since 5 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
