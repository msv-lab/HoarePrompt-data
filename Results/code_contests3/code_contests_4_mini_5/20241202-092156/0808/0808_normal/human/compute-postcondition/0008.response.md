The code assigns `False` to the index `j` of the list `a`. The initial state shows that `a` already has index `5` set to `False`, and the operation will set index `7` to `False`. The value of `i` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 set to `False`, index 7 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with index 3 set to `False`, index 5 set to `False`, index 7 set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
