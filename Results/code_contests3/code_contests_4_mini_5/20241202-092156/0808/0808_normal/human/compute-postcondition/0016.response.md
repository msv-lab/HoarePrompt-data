According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 11. The starting value for `j` in the loop is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. 

Since `j` is incremented by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration, we need to find the next value of `j` for the loop to execute again. The current value of `j` is 11, so the next value of `j` will be `11 + 3 = 14`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1000000. Since 14 is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 14, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1000000**
