The variable `a` is assigned a list containing 1,000,000 elements, all initialized to `True`. This does not affect the value of `n` or any other variables, but it establishes the state of the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True**
