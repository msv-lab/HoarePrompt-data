According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the range defined by `i ** 2 - 1`. The loop will execute if `i ** 2 - 1` is less than 1,000,000. Given `i` is 3, we can calculate `i ** 2 - 1` as follows:

- `i ** 2 - 1` = `3 ** 2 - 1` = `9 - 1` = `8`.

Since 8 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute. The initial value of `j` will be 8 for the first execution of the loop. 

Additionally, the state of the list `a` does not affect the execution of the loop since it only relies on the values of `i` and the calculated starting index. Therefore, no adjustments or checks are necessary for the state of `a`.

State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 8, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is 3 and `j` starts at 8**
