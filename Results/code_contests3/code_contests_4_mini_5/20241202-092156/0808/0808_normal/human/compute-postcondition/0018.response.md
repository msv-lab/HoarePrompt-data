To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the effect of the loop on the list `a` based on the initial conditions provided.

1. **Initial State**: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements. If `a[2]` is True, the loop will execute and set specific indices in `a` to False. If `a[2]` is False, the state of `a` remains unchanged.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to 3, and the loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8) up to 1,000,000 in increments of `i` (3).

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times:
- After 1 iteration, `j` is 8, and `a[8]` is set to False.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is 11, and `a[11]` is set to False.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is 14, and `a[14]` is set to False.

This pattern shows that the loop is setting `a[j]` to False for specific indices, starting from 8 and then incrementing by 3 each time. 

If `a[2]` is True, the loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches the upper limit of the range, which is 1,000,000. This means that all indices of the form `8 + 3k` (where `k` is a non-negative integer) will be set to False until it surpasses the length of the list. 

If `a[2]` is False, the loop will not execute at all, and the state of `a` will remain unchanged.

After considering both scenarios:
- If `a[2]` is True, then the output state will reflect that multiple indices have been set to False.
- If `a[2]` is False, then the output state will show that `a` has not changed.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements; if `a[2]` is True, then `a[8]`, `a[11]`, `a[14]`, ..., `a[j]` (for all j of the form 8 + 3k) are set to False; if `a[2]` is False, the state of `a` remains unchanged.**
