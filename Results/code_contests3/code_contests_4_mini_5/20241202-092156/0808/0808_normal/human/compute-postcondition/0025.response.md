According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 1,000, and `j` is set to `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to calculate the new value of `j`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and increases by `i` for each iteration. If `j` is currently `i`, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that the new value of `j` (which will be `i + i` or `2i`) is still less than 1,000,000. Thus, `j` must become `2i` for the next iteration.

So, if `i` is less than 1,000, then `2i` must be less than 1,000,000 for the loop to continue. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[j]` set to `False`, `i` is less than 1,000, `j` is 2*i, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
