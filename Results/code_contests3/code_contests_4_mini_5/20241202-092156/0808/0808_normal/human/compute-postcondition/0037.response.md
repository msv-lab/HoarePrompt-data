The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes several datasets, each containing an integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`. The total number of datasets is less than or equal to 30. After executing the function body, it produces an output based on the processed datasets. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle multiple datasets of integers and return results based on the specified criteria for those integers. 

Functionality: **The function processes up to 30 datasets, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999), and returns results based on the evaluation of these datasets.**
