According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop runs from `i ** 2 - 1` to `1,000,000` with a step of `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `1,000,000`. Given that at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1,000,000`, it indicates that `i` must be set to a value that allows `i ** 2 - 1` to be less than `1,000,000` and ensures the loop can still execute. 

Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to a value less than `1,000`. When `i` is `1,000`, `i ** 2 - 1` equals `999,999`, which is less than `1,000,000`, allowing the loop to execute. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is less than 1,000, and at the start of the next iteration `i` will be 1,000,000**
