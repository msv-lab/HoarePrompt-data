The code assigns `False` to the `j`-th index of the list `a`. Since `j` is equal to `i` and `i` is less than 1,000, the value at `a[j]` will be set to `False` in the list that originally contains 1,000,000 elements. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[j]` set to `False`, `i` is less than 1,000, `j` is `i`**
