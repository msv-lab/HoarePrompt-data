Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 20) and `V` (between 1 and 10000), along with two lists of floats `a` (containing `n` integers between 1 and 100) and `b` (containing `n` integers between 0 and 100). It calculates a minimum value based on the ratios of elements from lists `b` and `a`, multiplied by the corresponding elements of `a`, capped at `V`. The function does not handle edge cases where `b` contains zeros, which could lead to division by zero errors when calculating the ratios.**
