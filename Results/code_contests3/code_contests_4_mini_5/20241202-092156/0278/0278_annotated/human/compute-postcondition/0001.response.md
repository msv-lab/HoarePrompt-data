The code initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, by reading input values and converting them to floats. The input is taken from two separate lines, where each line contains space-separated values. The previous values of `n` and `V` are not directly affected by this code snippet, as they do not participate in the assignment of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `a` and `b` based on user input but will not specify their exact values since they depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20; `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000; `a` is a list of floats from the first input line; `b` is a list of floats from the second input line.**
