The code assigns values to `n` and `V` by reading input from `raw_input()` and converting it to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n` and `V` are unknown, but they are constrained by the defined ranges: `n` is between 1 and 20, and `V` is between 1 and 10000. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `n` and `V` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20; `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000.**
