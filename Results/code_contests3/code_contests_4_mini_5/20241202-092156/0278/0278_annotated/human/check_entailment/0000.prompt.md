You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It's a very unfortunate day for Volodya today. He got bad mark in algebra and was therefore forced to do some work in the kitchen, namely to cook borscht (traditional Russian soup). This should also improve his algebra skills.

According to the borscht recipe it consists of n ingredients that have to be mixed in proportion <image> litres (thus, there should be a1 ·x, ..., an ·x litres of corresponding ingredients mixed for some non-negative x). In the kitchen Volodya found out that he has b1, ..., bn litres of these ingredients at his disposal correspondingly. In order to correct his algebra mistakes he ought to cook as much soup as possible in a V litres volume pan (which means the amount of soup cooked can be between 0 and V litres). What is the volume of borscht Volodya will cook ultimately?

Input

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and V (1 ≤ n ≤ 20, 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000). The next line contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). Finally, the last line contains n space-separated integers bi (0 ≤ bi ≤ 100).

Output

Your program should output just one real number — the volume of soup that Volodya will cook. Your answer must have a relative or absolute error less than 10 - 4.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 20, V is an integer between 1 and 10000, ai is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 100, and bi is a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 100.
def func():
    n, V = map(int, raw_input().split())
    a, b = [float(i) for i in raw_input().split()], [float(i) for i in
    raw_input().split()]
    print(min(reduce(lambda ans, ai: ans + reduce(lambda minx, ab: min(minx, ab
    [0] / ab[1]), zip(b, a), 2.0 ** 30) * ai, a, 0), V))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 20) and `V` (between 1 and 10000), along with two lists of floats `a` (containing `n` integers between 1 and 100) and `b` (containing `n` integers between 0 and 100). It calculates a minimum value based on the ratios of elements from lists `b` and `a`, multiplied by the corresponding elements of `a`, capped at `V`. The function does not handle edge cases where `b` contains zeros, which could lead to division by zero errors when calculating the ratios.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
