The function `func` accepts integer inputs `n` and `V`, and two lists of floating-point numbers `a` and `b`, which must satisfy certain constraints. It calculates a minimum value based on a complex lambda function that operates on these inputs. Specifically, it uses the `reduce` function to perform calculations across the lists `a` and `b`, taking the ratio of elements from `b` and `a`, and applying a minimum operation with a large number. Finally, it prints the minimum value that meets the criteria set by `V`. 

However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, the function assumes that the inputs are provided correctly and does not handle potential errors that may arise from invalid inputs or empty lists. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n` and `V`, and two lists `a` and `b`, computes a minimum value based on ratios from these lists and prints it, but does not return a value and does not handle input errors. **
