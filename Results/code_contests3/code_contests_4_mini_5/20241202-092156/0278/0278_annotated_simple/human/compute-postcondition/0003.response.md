The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `b` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `bi` satisfies 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on certain conditions. However, the specific outputs based on the input conditions are not provided in the output statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function is described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), V (an integer), a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of n integers), and processes these inputs to return a result based on the defined logic.**
