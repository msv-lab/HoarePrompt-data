Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 20) and `V` (between 1 and 10000), as well as two lists `a` and `b` containing `n` floating-point numbers each. It calculates a minimum value based on the elements of these lists and prints the minimum of the computed value and `V`. The function does not handle any edge cases such as empty input lists or invalid input formats and assumes the inputs will always be provided correctly. **
