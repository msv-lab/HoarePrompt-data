The values of `n` and `V` are assigned from the input using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes an input line, splits it by spaces, and converts each part to an integer. Since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `V`, but we know that `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 20, and `V` will still be an integer between 1 and 10000. The lists `ai` and `bi` remain unchanged as this code does not affect them.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20; `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000; `ai` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 100; `bi` is a list of n integers where each element is between 0 and 100.**
