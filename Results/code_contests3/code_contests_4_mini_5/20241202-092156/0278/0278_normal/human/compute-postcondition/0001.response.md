The code assigns the values from the input to two new lists, `a` and `b`. Each list is constructed by taking a space-separated string input, converting each element to a float, and storing them in the respective lists. The initial state of the variables does not change, but new lists are created based on user input.

The values of `n`, `V`, `ai`, and `bi` are not directly affected by this code snippet. However, `a` and `b` now hold the values that are provided as input, which can be any float values based on the input given.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 20; `V` is an integer between 1 and 10000; `ai` is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 100; `bi` is a list of n integers where each element is between 0 and 100; `a` is a list of floats from input; `b` is a list of floats from input.**
