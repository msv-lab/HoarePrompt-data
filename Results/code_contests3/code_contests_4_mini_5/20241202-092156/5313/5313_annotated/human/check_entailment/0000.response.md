To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func()` to see if it correctly calculates the minimum perimeter for a given area `N`.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The function must compute the minimum perimeter of a shape that encloses an area of exactly `N` city blocks.
2. The perimeter must be minimized based on the geometric properties of the shapes that can be formed with `N` blocks.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `n` (which corresponds to `N` in the problem description).
2. It computes the integer square root `x` of `n`.
3. The program has different branches based on whether `n` is a perfect square or not:
   - If `n` is a perfect square (`x ** 2 == n`), the perimeter is calculated as `4 * x`.
   - If `n` is not a perfect square, it checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`:
     - If true, it returns `4 * x + 2`.
     - If false, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Edge Cases and Considerations:
- The perimeter of a shape that encloses the area can vary significantly based on the shape. For instance, a square shape tends to have the smallest perimeter for a given area.
- The checks made in the program seem to be aimed at determining whether `n` can be enclosed by a rectangle of dimensions derived from `x` and `x + 1`.

### Verification Against Examples:
- For `N = 4`: The square root is `2`, so it returns `4 * 2 = 8`, which is correct (the perimeter of a 2x2 square).
- For `N = 11`: The square root is `3`, and since `3 * (3 + 1) > 11`, it returns `4 * 3 + 2 = 14`, which is correct.
- For `N = 22`: The square root is `4`, and since `4 * (4 + 1) > 22` is false, it returns `4 * (4 + 1) = 20`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum perimeter for all possible values of `N` based on the logic implemented. It adheres to the problem description by calculating the perimeter based on the area and ensuring that it accounts for perfect squares and other arrangements.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
