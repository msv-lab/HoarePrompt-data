`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which is the integer square root of `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 10^6, so `x` will be calculated accordingly. The state of `N` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.**
