The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since we know that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and that `x` squared is equal to `n`, we can derive that `n = x^2`. This means `x` can take values from 1 to 1000 since `1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6`. Therefore, `answr` will be four times `x`, leading to the possible values of `answr` ranging from 4 to 4000. 

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 times `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 times `x`.**
