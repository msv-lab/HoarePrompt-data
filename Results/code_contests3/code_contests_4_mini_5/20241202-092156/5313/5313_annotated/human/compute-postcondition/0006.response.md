The variable `answr` is assigned the value of the expression `(x + x + 1) * 2`. The value of `x` is known to be an integer such that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and `x` squared is not equal to `n`. Therefore, `x + x + 1` can be simplified to `2x + 1`. 

The resultant value of `answr` would be `2 * (2x + 1)` which simplifies to `4x + 2`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n` where `x` squared is not equal to `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n` where `x` squared is not equal to `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`**.
