Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x ** 2 == n`, then `answr` is set to 4 times `x`. If `x ** 2 != n`, and if `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is set to `4x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is set to `4 * (x + 1)`.***
