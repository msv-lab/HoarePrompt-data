The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The value of `x` is known to be the integer square root of `n`, which means `x` is a positive integer that satisfies the conditions provided. Since `x` is a positive integer, `x + 1` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `answr` is calculated as `4` multiplied by `x + 1`.

Given that `x * (x + 1)` is less than or equal to `n`, we can deduce that `answr` will also be a positive integer. However, without knowing the specific value of `n`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `answr`, but we can represent it in terms of `x`.

The output state will therefore include the values of `N`, `n`, `x`, and the calculated result for `answr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
