The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^6 \). The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate based on an internally defined positive integer `N` within the specified range, but without additional details, the specific return value remains unclear.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on an internally defined positive integer N within the range of 1 to 10^6. The specific return value is not provided.**
