Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). It computes the integer square root `x` of `n` and determines a variable `answr` based on whether `n` is a perfect square or not. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4x`. If not, it checks if `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n` to return `4x + 2`, otherwise it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The result is then printed. Edge cases include the handling of perfect squares and values of `n` that are just above a square of an integer.**
