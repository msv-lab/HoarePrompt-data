Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`; the square of `x` is not equal to `n`. If `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is assigned the value of (x + x + 1) * 2. Otherwise, `answr` is 4 * (x + 1).***
