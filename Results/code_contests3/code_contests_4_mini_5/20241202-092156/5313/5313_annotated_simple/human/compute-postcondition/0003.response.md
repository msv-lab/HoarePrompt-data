The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`, and `x` squared is equal to `n`, we can deduce that `answr` will be equal to `n` multiplied by 4. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `n` and `answr` through the value of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `n * 4`.**
