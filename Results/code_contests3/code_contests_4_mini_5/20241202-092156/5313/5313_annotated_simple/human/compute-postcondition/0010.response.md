Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`. If `x ** 2` equals `n`, then `answr` is equal to `n * 4`. If `x ** 2` is not equal to `n` and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is assigned the value of (x + x + 1) * 2. Otherwise, `answr` is assigned the value of 4 * (x + 1).***
