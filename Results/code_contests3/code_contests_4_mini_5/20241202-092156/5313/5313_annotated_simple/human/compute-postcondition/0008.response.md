`answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. Since `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`, and given the constraints, `x + 1` will be greater than `x`. Thus, `answr` will be calculated based on the value of `x`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state will include the value of `answr` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer value of the square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**.
