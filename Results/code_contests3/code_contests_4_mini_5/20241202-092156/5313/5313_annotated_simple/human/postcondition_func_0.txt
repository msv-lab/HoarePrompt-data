The function accepts a positive integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and calculates a value based on the integer square root of `n`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * sqrt(n)`. If not, it assesses whether the sum of `x` and `x + 1` (where `x` is the integer square root of `n`) exceeds `n` to determine if it should return `(x + x + 1) * 2` or `4 * (x + 1)`. The function prints the final result, which is derived based on these calculations. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
