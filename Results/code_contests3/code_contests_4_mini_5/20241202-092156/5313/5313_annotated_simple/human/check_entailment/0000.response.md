To determine whether the provided program meets the problem description's requirements, we need to analyze its logic and how it calculates the minimum perimeter for a given area \( N \).

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The program needs to find the minimum perimeter that can enclose an area of exactly \( N \) blocks, where the blocks are arranged in a square grid.
2. We know that to minimize the perimeter for a given area, we should ideally form a rectangle (or a square) that is as close to a square shape as possible.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program first calculates the integer square root of \( N \) and assigns it to \( x \).
- It then checks if \( x^2 = N \):
  - If true, it calculates the perimeter as \( 4 \times x \).
- If \( x^2 \neq N \):
  - It checks if \( x \times (x + 1) > N \):
    - If true, it calculates the perimeter as \( (x + x + 1) \times 2 \).
    - If false, it calculates the perimeter as \( 4 \times (x + 1) \).

### Perimeter Calculation Logic:
1. When \( N \) is a perfect square, the perimeter is straightforwardly calculated.
2. For non-perfect square \( N \):
   - The logic of determining the perimeter based on whether \( x \times (x + 1) \) is greater than \( N \) is intended to check if a rectangle can be formed that is more square-like.
   - However, the conditions and calculations may not always yield the minimum perimeter for all potential rectangles that could enclose \( N \).

### Critical Cases:
- For certain values of \( N \), the perimeter calculation could yield an incorrect result. 
- For example, \( N = 11 \):
  - The program calculates \( x = 3 \) (since \( 3^2 < 11 < 4^2 \)).
  - It checks \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \) (which is greater than 11), so it calculates the perimeter as \( (3 + 3 + 1) \times 2 = 14 \).
  - However, the optimal rectangle for area 11 is a \( 3 \times 4 \) rectangle, which yields a perimeter of \( 2 \times (3 + 4) = 14 \), which is correct in this case but may not hold for other values.

### Conclusion:
The program does not account for all possible configurations of rectangles that can enclose the area \( N \) optimally. There are cases where it could return a perimeter that is not the minimum due to the conditions used in the calculations.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to cover all scenarios adequately, potentially leading to incorrect perimeter calculations for certain values of \( N \).
