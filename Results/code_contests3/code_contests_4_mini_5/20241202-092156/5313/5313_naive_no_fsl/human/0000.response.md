To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code and evaluate it against the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimum perimeter for a given area \( N \) in a square grid. The perimeter of a shape is minimized for a given area when the shape is as close to a square as possible. 

Let's break down the program:

1. **Calculate the integer square root**: 
   ```python
   x = int(n ** 0.5)
   ```
   This finds the largest integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \leq N \).

2. **Check if \( N \) is a perfect square**:
   ```python
   if x ** 2 == n:
       answr = x * 4
   ```
   If \( N \) is a perfect square, it correctly computes the perimeter as \( 4 \times x \).

3. **Check if the area can be enclosed with dimensions \( x \) and \( x + 1 \)**:
   ```python
   elif x * (x + 1) > n:
       answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
   ```
   This condition checks if \( x \times (x + 1) \) is greater than \( N \). However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the perimeter is minimized since we might have to consider other combinations of dimensions.

4. **If neither of the above, calculate a perimeter for a rectangle of dimensions \( x + 1 \)**:
   ```python
   else:
       answr = 4 * (x + 1)
   ```
   This assumes that \( N \) can be enclosed in a rectangle of dimension \( (x+1) \times (x+1) \), but this does not account for cases where other rectangular dimensions could provide a smaller perimeter.

### Example Cases to Consider

- For \( N = 10 \):
  - The program will compute \( x = 3 \) (since \( 3^2 = 9 \)).
  - It will check \( 3 \times (3 + 1) = 12 > 10 \), so it would compute the perimeter as \( (3 + 3 + 1) \times 2 = 14 \). However, the optimal rectangle of area 10 could be \( 2 \times 5 \), which yields a perimeter of \( 2 \times (2 + 5) = 14 \) as well.
  
- For \( N = 12 \):
  - \( x = 3 \) again.
  - It will check \( 3 \times (3 + 1) = 12 \) and go to the else part, giving \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) instead of the optimal rectangle \( 3 \times 4 \), which gives a perimeter of \( 14 \).

From these evaluations, we see that the program does not correctly compute the minimum perimeter for all possible values of \( N \). It is missing logic to handle various combinations of dimensions that could yield a smaller perimeter.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, we determine:

Correctness: **False**
