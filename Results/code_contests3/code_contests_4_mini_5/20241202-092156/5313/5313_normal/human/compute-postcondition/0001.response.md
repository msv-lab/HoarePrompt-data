`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which is the integer square root of `n`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6, `n` will fall within this range. Therefore, `x` will hold the integer value of the square root of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.**
