The value of `answr` is assigned the result of the expression `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and it is not true that `x` is an integer, this implies that `n` is not a perfect square, and therefore `x` is the largest integer less than the square root of `n`. 

Since `x * (x + 1) > n`, it indicates that `x` is sufficiently large such that when multiplied by `x + 1`, it exceeds `n`. 

The expression simplifies to `answr = (2x + 1) * 2`, which can be further simplified to `answr = 4x + 2`.

No other variables are affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n` and it is not true that `x` is an integer; `x * (x + 1) is greater than n; answr = 4x + 2**
