`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and `x` squared is equal to `n`, the value of `answr` will be `4 * x`, where `x` is the square root of `n`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x**
