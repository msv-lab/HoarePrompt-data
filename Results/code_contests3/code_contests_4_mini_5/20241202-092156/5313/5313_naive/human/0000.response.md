To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it calculates the minimum perimeter that can enclose exactly N city blocks.

The program attempts to find the integer square root of N (denoted by `x`), and then it checks a few conditions to determine the perimeter:

1. If `x ** 2 == n`: This checks if N is a perfect square. If it is, the perimeter is `x * 4` (the perimeter of a square).
2. If `x * (x + 1) > n`: This condition checks if a rectangle of the dimensions `x` by `x + 1` would exceed the area N. If this is true, it sets the perimeter to `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
3. In the final case, if neither of the above conditions hold, it calculates the perimeter for the rectangle `(x + 1) by (x + 1)` which is `4 * (x + 1)`.

Now, let's identify potential issues or edge cases:

- For N = 1: 
  - The program calculates `x = 1`, and since `1 ** 2 == 1`, it returns `4`. This is correct since the perimeter of a square of area 1 is indeed 4.
  
- For N = 2: 
  - The program calculates `x = 1`. It goes into the last condition since `1 * (1 + 1) = 2` is not greater than `2`. It calculates the perimeter as `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. This is correct as the best shape is a 1 by 2 rectangle which has a perimeter of 6, but the program incorrectly computes it as 8.
  
- For N = 3: 
  - The program calculates `x = 1`. The calculation goes to the last condition and computes the perimeter as `4 * (1 + 1) = 8`. This is incorrect since the best shape is a 1 by 3 rectangle which has a perimeter of 8, but the program's logic does not account for this properly.
  
- For N = 5: 
  - The program calculates `x = 2`, and it checks the second condition. It calculates the perimeter as `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. This is incorrect since the best shape here is a 1 by 5 rectangle which has a perimeter of 12, but the logic doesn't correctly derive it.
  
- For N = 6: 
  - The program calculates `x = 2` and computes the perimeter as `4 * (2 + 1) = 12`. This should be a 2 by 3 rectangle which has a perimeter of 10. This means the output is not correct.

Since the program fails to compute the correct perimeter for several values of N, we can conclude that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
