According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the input string provided by `raw_input()`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters left to be processed in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current character being processed from the input string. 

Since `i` is the first character of the input string, for the loop to execute one more time, it means we need to move to the next character in the string. Therefore, we need to update `i` to point to the next character.

If the input string has a length greater than the current position of `i`, the loop can execute again. If `i` is currently at the last character, the loop will not execute again. 

Thus, if `a` and `b` are unchanged and `pa` is based on whether the initial character of the input string is '1', we need to increment the position of `i` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the next character of the input string is '1'**
