According to the code, the loop will execute based on the input received from `raw_input()`. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in the input string provided. Since `pa` is initialized to 0, it does not directly influence the execution of the loop but may be relevant within the loop body.

For the loop to execute at least once, `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `raw_input()` results in a non-empty string. 

In terms of `i`, it will begin with the first character of whatever string is input. 

State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string and `i` will be the first character of that string.**
