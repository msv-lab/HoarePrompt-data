To determine the output state, we analyze the code snippet provided:

1. `pb` is either 1 or 2 based on the new value of `i`.
2. The expression `i == '1'` evaluates to `True` (1) or `False` (0) depending on whether `i` is equal to the string '1'.
3. The code `pb += i == '1'` means that if `i` is '1', `pb` will increment by 1; otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Given this logic and the initial values:
- If `i` is '1', `pb` increments by 1.
- If `i` is not '1', `pb` remains unchanged.

Thus, we can summarize the output based on the possible value of `i` and its effect on `pb`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the remaining input string; `pb` is either 2 or 3 if `i` is '1', or remains 1 or 2 if `i` is not '1'; `i` is the third character of the input string if it exists.**
