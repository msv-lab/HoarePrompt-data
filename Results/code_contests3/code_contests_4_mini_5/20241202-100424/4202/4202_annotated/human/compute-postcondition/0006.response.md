To analyze the impact of the code on the program:

1. The expression `i == '1'` checks if the value of `i` is equal to the string `'1'`. 
2. If `i` is indeed equal to `'1'`, the expression evaluates to `True`, which in Python is equivalent to `1`. If `i` is not equal to `'1'`, it evaluates to `False`, which is equivalent to `0`.
3. The result of the expression `i == '1'` is then added to the current value of `pa`, effectively incrementing `pa` by `1` if `i` is `'1'` or leaving it unchanged if `i` is not `'1'`.
4. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

The final output state will depend on whether `i` is equal to `'1'` or not.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged depending on whether `i` is '1', and `i` must be less than the length of the input string for the loop to execute again.**
