`pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `i` is given as the second character of the input string, which determines whether `pb` will increase. If `i` is '1', `pb` becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 1. Therefore, the Output State depends on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is '1':
- `pb` becomes 2.

If `i` is not '1':
- `pb` remains 1.

Thus, the Output State is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the remaining input string, `pb` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `i`, and `i` is the second character of the input string (if it exists).

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the remaining input string, `pb` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `i`, and `i` is the second character of the input string (if it exists)**.
