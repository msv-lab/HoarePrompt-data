The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are 01-strings, which means they are strings composed solely of the characters "0" and "1". The lengths of these strings range from 1 to 1000 characters, inclusive. After executing the function body, it processes these strings and produces a result based on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, both of which are 01-strings of length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It processes these strings to produce a result based on their binary values.**
