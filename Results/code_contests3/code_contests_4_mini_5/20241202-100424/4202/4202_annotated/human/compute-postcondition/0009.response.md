According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided to `raw_input()`. The loop will iterate over each character of the input string. The initial state indicates that `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string `a`, and `pb` is 0, but does not specify the contents of `a` or the input string.

For the loop to execute at least once, the input string must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input string contains at least one character.

At the end of the last iteration, the state of `pb` is still 0. 

So, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that the input string is not empty, and `i` will be the first character of the input string.

State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input string from raw_input() is not empty, and `i` is the first character of the input string**
