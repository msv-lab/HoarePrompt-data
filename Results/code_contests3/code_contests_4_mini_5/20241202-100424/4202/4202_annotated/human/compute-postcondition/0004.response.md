`pa` is updated by adding 1 if the condition `i == '1'` is true, otherwise it remains unchanged. The current value of `pa` can either be 0 or 1, depending on its previous state. The value of `i` is not defined in the initial state, so I cannot determine if `pa` is incremented or not. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 0 or 1 and it may or may not be incremented based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is either 0 or 1 and it may or may not be incremented based on the value of `i`.**
