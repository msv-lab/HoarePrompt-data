Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if string `a` can be transformed into string `b` according to the operations defined in the problem description. 

Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` twice to read the input strings, but it does not store these strings into variables `a` and `b`. Instead, it counts the number of '1's in the input, which is not the intended operation according to the problem description.

2. **Logic for Transformation**: The logic used in the program only compares the count of '1's in the two strings, `pa` and `pb`. This does not account for the actual operations allowed (appending parity and removing the first character). The problem requires a more comprehensive check of whether `a` can be transformed into `b`, which may involve the structure of the strings and not just the count of '1's.

3. **Output Handling**: The output logic is also incorrect. The program uses a list index to choose between 'NO' and 'YES' based on the counts of '1's, which fails to consider the actual transformation steps that could be performed. 

In summary, the program only checks the counts of '1's and does not implement the necessary logic to determine the actual transformation possibility between the two strings. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
