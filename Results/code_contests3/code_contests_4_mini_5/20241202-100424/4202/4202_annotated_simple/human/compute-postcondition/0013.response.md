According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input being read by `raw_input()`. Since `a` is a non-empty string, it implies that there are characters to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of the input string. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop must read the next character from the input string. So, if `i` is the second character now, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the third character of the input string.

Since `pb` is either 0 or 1 and is increased by 1 if `i` is '1', its value will depend on the current value of `i`. If the next character (third character in the string) is '1', `pb` will become 1 if it was 0, or it will remain 1 if it was already 1.

Thus, the updated states would be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the third character of the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1; for the loop to execute again, `i` must be the third character of the string.**
