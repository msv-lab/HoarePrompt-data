The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is '1', then `pb` becomes either 1 or 2; if `i` is not '1', then `pb` remains the same. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the third character of the input string, `pb` is updated based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the third character of the input string, `pb` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same depending on whether `i` is '1' or not.**
