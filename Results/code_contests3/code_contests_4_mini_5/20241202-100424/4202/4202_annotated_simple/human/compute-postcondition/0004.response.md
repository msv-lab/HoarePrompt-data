The value of `i` is the second character of string `a`. The expression `i == '1'` checks if this character is equal to '1', resulting in either `True` (1) or `False` (0). The value of `pa` will be incremented by 1 if `i` is '1', otherwise, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is either 0 or 1 (depending on if the second character of `a` is '1'), `i` is the second character of string `a`.**
