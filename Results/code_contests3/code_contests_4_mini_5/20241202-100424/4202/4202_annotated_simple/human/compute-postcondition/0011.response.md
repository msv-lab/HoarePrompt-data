According to the code, the loop iterates through each character in the `raw_input()` string. The loop will continue to execute for as long as there are characters remaining in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the input string. The loop will execute again for the next character in the input string.

Since `a` is a non-empty string, after the last iteration, `i` will change to the next character in the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to represent the next character in the string.

If `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, it remains unchanged for the next iteration, as it does not affect the loop's execution.

Given this, we need to determine the next character in the string after the current `i`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the second character of the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1**
