Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-empty strings consisting of the characters "0" and "1", reads them from input, counts the number of '1's in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to that in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Note that the function does not explicitly pass the parameters `a` and `b`, and instead reads them directly from input, which may lead to confusion regarding the expected input behavior. **
