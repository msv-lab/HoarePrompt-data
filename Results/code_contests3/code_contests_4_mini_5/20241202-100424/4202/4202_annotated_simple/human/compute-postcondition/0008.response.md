`pb` is assigned the value `0`, which initializes it to zero. The values of `a`, `b`, `pa`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the last character of the input string processed, and `pb` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the last character of the input string processed, `pb` is 0**
