The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the first character `i` is equal to '1'. Since `i` is the first character of the input string, it can either be '1' or not. Therefore, if `i` is '1', then `pb` becomes 1 (since `pb` starts at 0); if `i` is not '1', then `pb` remains 0. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, the Output State can be represented based on the possible values of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the first character of the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1**
