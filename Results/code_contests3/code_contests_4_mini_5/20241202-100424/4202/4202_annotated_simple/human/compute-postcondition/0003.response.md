According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by `raw_input()`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters in the input string. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is 0, and `i` is the first character of string `a`. If `i` is '1', then `pa` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that the next character of the string `a` must be available. Since the loop processes each character of the string sequentially, if `i` was the first character, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be the second character of the string. Therefore, `pa` will remain the same unless the next character is '1'.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is 0, `i` is the second character of string `a`**.
