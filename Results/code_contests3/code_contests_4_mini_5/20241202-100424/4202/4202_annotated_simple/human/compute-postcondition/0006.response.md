The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. Since `pa` is either 0 or 1, the resulting value of `pa` can be either 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is '1' or not. The states of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is either 0 or 1 (and can become 1 or 2 depending on `i`), and `i` will be the next character from the input.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is either 0 or 1 (and can become 1 or 2 depending on `i`), `i` will be the next character from the input.**
