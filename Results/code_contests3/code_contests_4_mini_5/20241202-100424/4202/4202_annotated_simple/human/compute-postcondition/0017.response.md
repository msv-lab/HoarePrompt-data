The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-empty strings consisting only of the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. After executing the function body, it processes these strings according to specific logic. However, the exact return values or conditions based on the input parameters have not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-empty strings consisting of "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The specific output or behavior based on these parameters is not defined.**
