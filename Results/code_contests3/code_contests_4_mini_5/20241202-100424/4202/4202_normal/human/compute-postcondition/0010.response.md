`pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is 0, and since the input is a non-empty string, `i` will be either '0' or '1'. Therefore, `pb` will either remain 0 (if `i` is '0') or become 1 (if `i` is '1'). 

The output state reflects these possibilities. 

Output State: **`a` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `b` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of that input.**
