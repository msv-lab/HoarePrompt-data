According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input received from `raw_input()`. The loop will iterate for each character in the input string. Since `pa` is the count of '1's in the input and `pb` is 0, the initial state of `a` and `b` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, but it does provide context for what the loop may process.

For the loop to execute at least once, the input from `raw_input()` must contain at least one character. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input is not an empty string. 

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- The input from `raw_input()` must be a non-empty string (it can be "0", "1", or any combination).
- The variable `i` should be initialized to the first character of this input.

State: **`a` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `b` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input from raw_input() is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of that input.**
