The variable `pb` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `pa` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `pa`, along with the new value of `pb`.

Output State: **`a` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `b` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is 0**
