The code checks if the first character of the input (which is stored in `i`) is equal to the string '1'. If it is, `pa` is incremented by 1. Since `pa` is initially 0, if `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1; if `i` is '0', then `pa` remains 0. Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `i`. 

Output State: **`a` is "0", `b` is "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1 based on whether the input character `i` is '0' or '1'**
