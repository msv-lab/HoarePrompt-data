The variable `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `pa` can either be 0 or 1 based on the previous state. If `i` is '1', then `pa` will be incremented to 1 or 2, depending on its initial value. If `i` is not '1', `pa` remains unchanged. The character `i` is determined by the next character in the input string, which is necessary for the loop to execute again. Thus, the output state reflects the possible values of `pa`.

Output State: **`a` is "0", `b` is "1", `pa` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', or remains either 0 or 1 if `i` is not '1'**
