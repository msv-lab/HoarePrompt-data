The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the third character `i` is '1'. Since `pb` is either 0 or 2, if `i` is '1', `pb` will become 1 or 3, respectively, and if `i` is '0', `pb` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1"; `b` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1"; `pa` is the count of '1's in the input; `pb` is either 1 or 3 if `i` is '1', or remains 0 or 2 if `i` is '0'; `i` is the third character of the input.
