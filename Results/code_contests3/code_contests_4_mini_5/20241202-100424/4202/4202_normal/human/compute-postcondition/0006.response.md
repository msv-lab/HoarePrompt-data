The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. If `i` is '1', `pa` will be either 2 or 3 (depending on its previous value), and if `i` is not '1', `pa` will remain either 0 or 1. The values of `a` and `b` are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is "0", `b` is "1", `pa` is either 2 or 3 if `i` is '1', or remains either 0 or 1 if `i` is not '1'.

Output State: **`a` is "0", `b` is "1", `pa` is either 2 or 3 if `i` is '1', or remains either 0 or 1 if `i` is not '1'**
