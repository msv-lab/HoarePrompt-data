`pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `i` is the second character of the input string, which could be either '0' or '1'. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` increases by 1; if `i` is '0', `pb` remains unchanged. The value of `pb` can be either 0 or 1 before this operation, and depending on the value of `i`, it can become either 0 or 2 after the operation.

Output State: **`a` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `b` is a string consisting only of "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input, `pb` is either 0 or 2, `i` is the second character of that input**.
