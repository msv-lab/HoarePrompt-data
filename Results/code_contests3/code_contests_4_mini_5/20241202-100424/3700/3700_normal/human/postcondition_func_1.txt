The function reads two inputs: the first input contains an integer H and an integer N, and the second input consists of N integers. It calculates the sum of the N integers and compares it to H. If the sum is greater than or equal to H, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. There is no handling for edge cases such as when N is 0, which would lead to a comparison with H of the sum of an empty list.
