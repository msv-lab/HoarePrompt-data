The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` (number of monsters) and `b` (maximum Special Moves), computes their sum `c`, and returns `c`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it is reduced by `mod` before returning. The function does not utilize or validate the health values of monsters provided in the context, nor does it handle cases where `mod` is not defined.
