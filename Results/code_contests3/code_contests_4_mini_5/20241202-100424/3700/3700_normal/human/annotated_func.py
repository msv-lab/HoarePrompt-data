#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and the health values of the monsters are provided as a list of integers where each health value H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is reduced by `mod` and remains non-negative.
    return c
    #The program returns the non-negative integer value of c, which is reduced by mod if c is greater than or equal to mod
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` (number of monsters) and `b` (maximum Special Moves), computes their sum `c`, and returns `c`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, it is reduced by `mod` before returning. The function does not utilize or validate the health values of monsters provided in the context, nor does it handle cases where `mod` is not defined.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers, `N` is an integer, and `s` is the sum of the integers in `H`. If `s` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two inputs: the first input contains an integer H and an integer N, and the second input consists of N integers. It calculates the sum of the N integers and compares it to H. If the sum is greater than or equal to H, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. There is no handling for edge cases such as when N is 0, which would lead to a comparison with H of the sum of an empty list.
