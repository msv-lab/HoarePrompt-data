The code prints 'No', which does not change the values of the variables `H`, `N`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the action taken.

Output State: **`H` is a list of integers from input, `N` is an integer from input, `s` is the sum of the integers provided in the input, and 'No' is printed.**
