In the provided code, `H` is assigned the value of a list created by taking input values and converting them to integers. The initial state mentions that `N` is an integer, and `H` is a list of integers. The code snippet indicates that both `H` and `N` will be populated from the input.

Given the initial state and the input for `H` and `N`, the output state will reflect the new values of `H` and `N` based on the input received.

Output State: **`H` is a list of integers from input, `N` is the integer from input**
