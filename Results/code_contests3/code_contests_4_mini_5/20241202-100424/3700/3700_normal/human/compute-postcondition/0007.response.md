The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `H`. `N` is an integer that satisfies the condition 1 <= N <= 200000. `K` is an integer that satisfies the condition 0 <= K <= 200000. `H` is a list of integers where each integer `H_i` satisfies the condition 1 <= H_i <= 10^9. After executing the function body, the exact output behavior is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of integers `H`, with specific constraints on their values, but the return value is not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer between 1 and 200000), K (an integer between 0 and 200000), and H (a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9).**
