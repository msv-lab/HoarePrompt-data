The code snippet takes input from the user, splits it into individual string components, converts each component to an integer, and then computes the sum of these integers. The variable `s` is assigned this sum. The initial state indicates that `H` is a list of integers from input, and `N` is an integer from input. The values of `H` and `N` are not directly affected by this line of code; instead, `s` will hold the computed sum of the integers provided in the input.

Since `H` and `N` are not directly referenced in the code, their states remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new value of `s` which is the sum of the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`H` is a list of integers from input, `N` is an integer from input, `s` is the sum of the integers provided in the input.**
