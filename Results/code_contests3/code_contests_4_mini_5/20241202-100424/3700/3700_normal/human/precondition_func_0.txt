a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and the health values of the monsters are provided as a list of integers where each health value H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
