Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of "Attack" actions needed by Fennec to defeat all monsters after using "Special Move" up to K times. However, the program instead checks if the sum of the health values of the monsters exceeds a certain threshold (H) and simply prints "Yes" or "No", which does not address the actual requirements of the problem.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 1
4 1 5
```

According to the problem description, Fennec can use her special move once (K = 1) and should reduce the health of the monsters strategically to minimize attacks required. The expected output here is `5`, as the monster with health 5 would be reduced to 0 with a special move, and Fennec would need to perform 4 attacks on the monster with health 4 and 1 attack on the monster with health 1, totaling 5 attacks.

However, the program simply outputs whether the total health exceeds a number without calculating the necessary attacks, which does not fulfill the requirements. Thus, it is incorrect.
