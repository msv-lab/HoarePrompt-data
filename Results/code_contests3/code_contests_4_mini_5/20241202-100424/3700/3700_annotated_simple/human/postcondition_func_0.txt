The function accepts two non-negative integers, `a` (representing the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), and returns the value of `c` calculated as `a + b` modulo `mod`. If `a + b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, `c` is set to `a + b - mod`, ensuring that `c` is non-negative in such cases. However, if `a + b` is less than `mod`, `c` will simply be `a + b`, which can be less than 0 if not checked properly. The function does not handle cases where `mod` is undefined or not set, which could lead to errors.
