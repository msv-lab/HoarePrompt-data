#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and the input list contains N integers H_i (1 <= H_i <= 10^9) representing the health of each monster.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer (1 <= a <= 200000), `b` is a non-negative integer (0 <= b <= 200000), and `c` is equal to `a + b - mod`, where `c` is greater than or equal to 0 if `c >= mod`.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of c, which is equal to a + b - mod, and is guaranteed to be non-negative if c >= mod.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `a` (representing the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of Special Moves), and returns the value of `c` calculated as `a + b` modulo `mod`. If `a + b` is greater than or equal to `mod`, `c` is set to `a + b - mod`, ensuring that `c` is non-negative in such cases. However, if `a + b` is less than `mod`, `c` will simply be `a + b`, which can be less than 0 if not checked properly. The function does not handle cases where `mod` is undefined or not set, which could lead to errors.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers where each H[i] (1 <= i <= N) satisfies 1 <= H[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers from input; `N` is the first integer from input; `s` is the sum of integers from new input. If `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `H`, then reads another list of integers and calculates the sum `s` of this second list. It prints 'Yes' if `s` is greater than or equal to `H` (which seems to be misinterpreted in the annotations since `H` is a list, not a single value), otherwise it prints 'No'. However, the function does not handle edge cases where `H` is an empty list or improperly checks against it, potentially leading to an error or unintended behavior.
