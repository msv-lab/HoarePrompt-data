The code executes a print statement that outputs 'Yes'. The values of the variables `H`, `N`, and `s` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. However, the output is generated as part of the program's execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `H` is a list of integers from input; `N` is the first integer from input; `s` is the sum of integers from new input, and the value of `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, and the message 'Yes' is printed.

Output State: **`H` is a list of integers from input; `N` is the first integer from input; `s` is the sum of integers from new input, and the value of `s` is greater than or equal to `H`; 'Yes' is printed.**
