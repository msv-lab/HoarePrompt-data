The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `H`. 

- `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 200000\).
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq K \leq 200000\).
- `H` is a list of integers where each \(H[i]\) (for \(1 \leq i \leq N\)) satisfies \(1 \leq H[i] \leq 10^9\).

The function does not have a specified output in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function based on the constraints and relationships provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (integer), K (non-negative integer), and H (list of integers), without specifying the return value or behavior.**
