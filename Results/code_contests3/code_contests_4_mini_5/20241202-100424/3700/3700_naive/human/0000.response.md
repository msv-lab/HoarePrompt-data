Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of attacks Fennec needs to perform before winning. Instead, it appears to check whether the sum of monster health values exceeds a certain threshold (H), and prints "Yes" or "No" based on that condition. 

For example, with the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
The expected output is `5`, as Fennec needs to perform five attacks (after using the special move once on the monster with health 4) to bring all monsters' health to zero. However, the program does not calculate or print the correct number of attacks needed; it only checks if the total health exceeds H, which is not part of the problem statement.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description correctly, leading to its incorrectness.
