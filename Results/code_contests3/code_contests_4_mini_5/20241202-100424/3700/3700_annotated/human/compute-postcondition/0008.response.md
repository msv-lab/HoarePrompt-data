Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (representing the number of subsequent integers to be input), reads another integer `H` (which is the threshold value), and then sums `N` integers provided as input. It prints 'Yes' if the sum of these integers is greater than or equal to `H`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not use the parameter `K` and does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
