The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `H`. The parameter `N` is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq N \leq 200000\). The parameter `K` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq K \leq 200000\). The parameter `H` is a list of integers where each integer \(H_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq H_i \leq 10^9\). 

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints and the nature of the parameters, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `N`, a non-negative integer `K`, and a list of integers `H`, where `N` is the number of elements in `H`, `K` represents a threshold or limit, and `H` contains the actual values that fall within the specified range. The specific return value based on these parameters is not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer), K (a non-negative integer), and H (a list of integers), and processes these inputs based on the constraints provided. The specific return value based on these parameters is not detailed.**
