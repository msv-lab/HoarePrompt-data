Postcondition: ***`N` is a new integer within the range 1 to 200000, `H` is a list of integers with each integer satisfying 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, and `s` is the sum of the integers from the input. If `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is less than `H`, 'No' is printed.***
