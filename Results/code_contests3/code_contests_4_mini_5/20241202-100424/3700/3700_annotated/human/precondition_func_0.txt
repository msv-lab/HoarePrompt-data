a is an integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, and b is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000. Additionally, the function expects a list of integers representing the health values of the monsters (H_i) such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each monster.
