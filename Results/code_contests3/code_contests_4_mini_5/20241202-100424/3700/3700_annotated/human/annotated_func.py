#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, and b is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000. Additionally, the function expects a list of integers representing the health values of the monsters (H_i) such that 1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each monster.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is an integer representing the number of monsters (N), `b` is an integer representing the maximum number of Special Moves (K), and `c` is the sum of `a` and `b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is the sum of `a` and `b` minus `mod`.
    return c
    #The program returns the sum of `a` and `b`, adjusted by `mod` if necessary
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` (number of monsters) and `b` (maximum number of Special Moves), and returns the sum of `a` and `b`, adjusted by `mod` if the sum is greater than or equal to `mod`. It does not utilize the list of health values of the monsters, which is mentioned in the annotations but not implemented in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`N` is a new integer within the range 1 to 200000, `H` is a list of integers with each integer satisfying 1 <= H_i <= 10^9, and `s` is the sum of the integers from the input. If `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is less than `H`, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (representing the number of subsequent integers to be input), reads another integer `H` (which is the threshold value), and then sums `N` integers provided as input. It prints 'Yes' if the sum of these integers is greater than or equal to `H`, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not use the parameter `K` and does not return any value; it only prints the result.
