Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. The first function (`func_1`) does not utilize the health values of the monsters at all, despite the problem requiring an understanding of how to minimize the number of attacks needed given the health points and the allowed special moves.

2. The second function (`func_2`) misinterprets the inputs. It reads an integer `H` as a threshold, which is not relevant to the problem as described. The problem describes that `H_i` are the health values of individual monsters, and the goal is to compute the minimum number of attacks needed, not to compare a sum against an arbitrary threshold.

For instance, in the test case with input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
The expected output is `5`, which can be calculated as follows:
- Use 1 special move on the monster with health `5`, reducing it to `0`.
- Attack the monster with health `4` down to `0` (3 attacks).
- Attack the monster with health `1` down to `0` (1 attack).
- Total attacks = 3 + 1 = 4. However, we can use one special move to reduce the monster health directly, leading to a total of `5` attacks.

Since the code does not correctly implement the required logic and instead has irrelevant functionality, the correctness is deemed false.
