The expression `print('10' * (n // 2) + ('1' if n & 1 else ''))` constructs a string based on the value of `n`. The value of `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers.

1. `n // 2` evaluates to the integer division of `n` by 2, which determines how many times the string '10' will be repeated.
2. The string '10' is repeated `(n // 2)` times.
3. The expression `('1' if n & 1 else '')` checks if `n` is odd (using the bitwise AND operator). If `n` is odd, it adds '1' to the end of the string; otherwise, it adds an empty string.

Thus, the output is a string that consists of '10' repeated `n // 2` times, followed by '1' if `n` is odd.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer representing the number of flowers; the output string is '10' repeated (n // 2) times followed by '1' if n is odd, otherwise an empty string.**
