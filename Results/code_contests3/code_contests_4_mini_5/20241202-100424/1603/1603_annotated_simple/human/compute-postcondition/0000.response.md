In the provided code snippet, `n` and `m` are assigned new values based on input received from `raw_input()`, which is split and converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified, but they are stated as positive integers representing the number of flowers and visitors, respectively. The input will replace these values with new integers.

Since the specific values of `n` and `m` are not given in the initial state and depend on the input, we cannot determine their exact new values. However, we can state that they will be replaced with valid positive integers based on the constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer representing the number of flowers, `m` is a new positive integer representing the number of visitors.**
