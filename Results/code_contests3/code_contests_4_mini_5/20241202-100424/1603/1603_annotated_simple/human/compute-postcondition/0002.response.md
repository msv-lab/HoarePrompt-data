The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates based on external inputs which include `n`, a positive integer representing the number of flowers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and `m`, a positive integer representing the number of visitors (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). Each visitor has a segment defined by `l_i` and `r_i`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

The function's output is determined by the segments provided for the visitors and the number of flowers. In specific cases, the function may return a result based on the conditions of these segments. 

Functionality: **The function processes the number of flowers and segments for visitors, returning results based on the defined segments and the constraints provided for the number of flowers and visitors.**
