Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Ignoring Visitor Ranges**: The program completely disregards the input of visitor ranges (`l_i` and `r_i`). The problem description states that the beauty of the exhibition is based on the visitors' segments, but the function does not take these segments into account at all.

2. **Fixed Flower Arrangement**: The function generates a specific pattern of '10' (roses and lilies) based solely on whether `n` is even or odd. This does not allow for any flexibility or optimization based on the visitor segments, which is crucial for maximizing the sum of beauties.

3. **No Calculation of Beauty**: The function does not calculate the beauty of any segments as required by the problem. The beauty is defined as the product of the number of roses and lilies within the given ranges, which is not addressed in the program.

4. **Output Relevance**: The output format does not correspond to the calculated beauty for the visitor ranges. The task demands that the arrangement of flowers maximizes beauty based on visitor preferences, which the function fails to achieve.

In conclusion, the function does not perform any operations related to the visitor segments or maximize the beauty of the exhibition as described, making it incorrect.
