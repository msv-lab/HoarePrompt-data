The function `func` does not directly accept parameters as it is defined with empty parentheses. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and for each pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i`, the constraints 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n hold true for i from 1 to m. 

The function's output will depend on the values of `n`, `m`, `l_i`, and `r_i`, but since those inputs are not explicitly passed as parameters in the function definition, we cannot specify exact return values without additional context on how these inputs are utilized within the function.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n and m are integers within the range 1 to 1000, and for each i from 1 to m, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The specific output or return value is not defined without further details on the implementation.**
