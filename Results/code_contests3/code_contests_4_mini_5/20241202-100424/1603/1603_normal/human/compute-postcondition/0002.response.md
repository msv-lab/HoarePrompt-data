The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that integers `n` and `m` are provided, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000. Additionally, the function processes `m` subsequent lines of input, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, satisfying the condition 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. 

The output of the function is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that the function performs operations based on the input values of `l_i` and `r_i`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process integer inputs under given constraints and output results based on those inputs.

Functionality: **The function processes inputs constrained by integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000, and m pairs of integers l_i and r_i such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, and returns results based on these inputs.**
