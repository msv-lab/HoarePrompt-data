The function accepts a string input that consists of a positive integer `n` (representing the row number) followed by a character `s` (representing the seat in that row). It processes this input to compute a specific output based on seating arrangements. The function does not handle invalid inputs or return error messages for invalid row numbers, and it directly prints the computed result without returning a value. The output is calculated based on the modified value of `n` and the ordinal position of the character `s`.
