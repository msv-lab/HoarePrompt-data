Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is the value read from input after stripping; `S` is the same value as `s`; `M` is either 1 or 2; `N` is updated to be either the previous value of `N` + 1 or the previous value of `N` + 2; the result of the expression `(N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C)` is printed.**
