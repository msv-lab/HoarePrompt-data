Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is the value read from input after stripping; `S` is the same value as `s`; if `M` is either 1 or 2, then `N` is updated to be either the previous value of `N` + 1 or the previous value of `N` + 2, and `M` is set to 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 2.***
