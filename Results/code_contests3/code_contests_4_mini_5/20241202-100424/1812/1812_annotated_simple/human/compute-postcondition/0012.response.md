Functionality: ** The function reads an input string consisting of a positive integer `N` (representing a row number) followed by a character `s` (representing a seat, which can be 'a' to 'f'). It then computes and prints a numerical value derived from these inputs based on specific calculations involving `N` and the position of `s`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.**
