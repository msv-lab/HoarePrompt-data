The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer with a constraint that it must be between 1 and 10^18, representing the row number. The parameter `s` is a character that must be one of the letters from 'a' to 'f', representing the seat in that row. The function returns a value based on the combination of these two parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed here. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number and a character s ('a' to 'f') representing the seat in that row.**
