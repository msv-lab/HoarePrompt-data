The code defines a lambda function `gets` that reads a line from standard input, strips any whitespace from the beginning and end, and can be called with an optional argument (defaulting to `sys.stdin.readline`). However, this does not directly affect the variables `n` or `s`, as there are no assignments or modifications made to them in the provided snippet. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the values of `n` and `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row number, and `s` is a character ('a' to 'f') representing the seat in that row.**
