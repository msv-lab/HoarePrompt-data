Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character ('a' to 'f'), `S` is an input string, `N` is the new integer value of `S` without its last character after decrementing by `M`, `C` is calculated based on the last character of `S`, `M` is either 1 or 2 and now `M` is changed to 2 or 1 respectively due to the operation `M ^= 3`.**
