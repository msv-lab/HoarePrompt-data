`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` plus `i`, where `i` is updated to the next character in `row`. This means that `nRow` will now contain its previous value concatenated with the next character from `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is updated to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.
