According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` takes on each character in `row` during each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a character in `row`, and we need to determine what needs to change for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `row` is a non-empty input string, it has at least one character. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1', but if `i` is not '9', the operation fails and `nRow` remains unchanged. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the last character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to take on the next character in `row`, which means we need to know how many characters are in `row`. Let's denote the length of `row` as `len(row)`, and since `row` is a non-empty string, `len(row)` is at least 1.

If `i` is set to the last character of `row`, the next iteration requires `i` to be the next character, which cannot happen as we have already reached the end of the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to consider that the end of the string has not been reached. 

Thus, the next state would be that `i` is pointing to the next character, which won't happen as we have exhausted all characters in `row`. However, since we need to state this in proper format, we can indicate that for the loop to execute one additional time, `row` must have characters left.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more character left.**
