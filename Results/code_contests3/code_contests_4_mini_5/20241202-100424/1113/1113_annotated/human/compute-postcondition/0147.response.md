The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string value. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified in the initial state, but it is being reset to an empty string. Other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string without whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is reset to 0.
