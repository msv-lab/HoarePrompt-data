The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. Since the initial state specifies that `nRow` is an empty string, after the execution of this code, `nRow` will now be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**.
