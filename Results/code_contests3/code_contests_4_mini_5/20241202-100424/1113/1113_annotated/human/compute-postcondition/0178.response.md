The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character '1' to it. Since `nRow` was not defined in the initial state, its previous value is unknown. However, the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is updated to the next character in `row` after the current character, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.
