According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, the `row` must not be an empty string, as an empty string would result in no iterations. Given the current states, `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `nRow` do not impact the execution of the loop directly; however, the key variable is `row`. Since `row` is specified as the input string without whitespace, we can assume it contains some characters.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `row` is a non-empty string. The variable `i` starts at 0 and will be reset for each character in `row` during the loop. The first character of `row` will be assigned to `i` during the first iteration.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character of `row` during the first iteration**
