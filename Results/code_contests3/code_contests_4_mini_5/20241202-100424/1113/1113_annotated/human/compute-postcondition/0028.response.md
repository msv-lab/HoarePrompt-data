The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, meaning it will be a non-empty string input provided by the user, and any leading or trailing whitespace will be removed. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `row` is now a non-empty string input.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'.**
