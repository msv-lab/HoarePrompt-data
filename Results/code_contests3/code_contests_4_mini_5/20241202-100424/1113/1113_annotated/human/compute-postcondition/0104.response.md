The `append` method is called on the list `res`, adding the value of `nRow` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings (including `nRow`), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'.
