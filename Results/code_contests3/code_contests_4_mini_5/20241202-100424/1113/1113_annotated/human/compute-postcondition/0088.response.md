`nRow` is assigned an empty string. This operation does not affect the values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, or `row`. The variable `nRow` now holds the value of an empty string, while its previous state was a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is the user's input string, `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is the user's input string, `nRow` is an empty string.**
