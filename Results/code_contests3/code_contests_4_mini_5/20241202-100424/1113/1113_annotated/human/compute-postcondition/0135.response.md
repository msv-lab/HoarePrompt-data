According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not equal to '9', which means it must be a character from the string `row`. Given that `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute again for the next character in the string. 

Since `i` is currently not equal to '9', it will take the next character in `row`. If `row` had a character at the next position, `i` will be assigned that character, and it will not affect `nRow`. 

To summarize:
- `maxint` remains positive infinity.
- `res` stays as a list containing 9 modified strings.
- `T` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` remains 2.
- `row` remains a non-empty string.
- `i` will now take the next character from `row`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the string representation of the next integer based on the new value of `i`.**
