`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `nRow` is the 9th character in `row`, and the value of `i` is the second character in `row`. Therefore, `nRow` becomes the concatenation of the 9th character and the 2nd character of `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is the concatenation of the 9th and 2nd characters in `row`, `i` is the second character in `row**.
