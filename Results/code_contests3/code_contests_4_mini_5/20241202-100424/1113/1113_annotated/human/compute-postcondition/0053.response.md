`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string, appending `i` (which is a character from `row` that is not '9') will result in `nRow` now containing that character. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now the character `i` (the first character of `row` which is not '9').

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now the character `i`**
