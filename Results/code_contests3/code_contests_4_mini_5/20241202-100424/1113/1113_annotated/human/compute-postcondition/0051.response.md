The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will now be '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is equal to '9'.**
