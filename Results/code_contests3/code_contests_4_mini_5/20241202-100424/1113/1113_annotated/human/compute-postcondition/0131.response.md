`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 0, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 0, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
