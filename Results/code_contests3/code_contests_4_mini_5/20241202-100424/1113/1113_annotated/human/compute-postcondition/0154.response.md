According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` has been updated to '1'. For the loop to execute again, `i` must take on the next character in `row`.

Since `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, it has at least one character. The first character of `row` is not equal to '9' during the first iteration, so for the next iteration, `i` will be the second character of `row`. If `row` has more than one character, then `nRow` will be set to the value of this new `i`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is the second character of `row`, and if `row` has more than one character, `nRow` is set to the value of `i`**.
