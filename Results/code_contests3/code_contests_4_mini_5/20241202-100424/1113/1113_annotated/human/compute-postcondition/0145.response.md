According to the code, the for loop is set to iterate 9 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8, which is the last index before the loop completes its range. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented to 9, which means the loop will not execute again since the range is 9 and `i` must be less than 9.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9 (it would be 9 after the last iteration), and since the loop has completed its iterations, the only way for it to execute again is to modify the loop condition or the value of `i`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', for the loop to execute again `i` must be reset to 0.**
