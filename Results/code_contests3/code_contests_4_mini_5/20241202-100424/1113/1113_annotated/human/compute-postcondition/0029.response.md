The code `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nRow`. This means that the previous value of `nRow`, which was formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', is now overwritten and lost. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is an empty string.**
