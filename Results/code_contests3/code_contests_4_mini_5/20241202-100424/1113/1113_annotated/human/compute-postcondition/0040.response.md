According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `row`. If `row` has at least 10 elements, the loop can execute for the next value of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9. The behavior of the loop indicates that if `i` reaches 9, `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 10 in the next iteration, and `nRow` will have been modified to reflect this change.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, for the loop to execute a tenth time `row` must contain at least 10 elements, and `i` will be 10.**
