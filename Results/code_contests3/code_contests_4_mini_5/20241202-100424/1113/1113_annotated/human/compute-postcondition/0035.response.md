Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, and `row` is a non-empty input string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, if `i` is not '9', the operation fails due to a type error, and `nRow` remains unchanged.***
