Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the string representation of the next integer plus '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the original string representation of the next integer plus the character `i`.***
