`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but since it is a string, the new value of `nRow` will be this original value plus `'1'`. The states of the other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is the second character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with `'1'`.
