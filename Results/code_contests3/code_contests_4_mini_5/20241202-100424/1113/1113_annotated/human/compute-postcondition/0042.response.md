`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 10. Since `nRow` is currently a list, this operation suggests that it is either being used to keep count or is being updated in some way. However, without the initial value of `nRow`, we cannot determine its exact state after the increment. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, and `i` is 10; `nRow` is increased by 10.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 10; `nRow` is increased by 10.**
