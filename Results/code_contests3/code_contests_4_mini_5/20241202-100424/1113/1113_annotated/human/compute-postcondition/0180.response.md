Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, and `i` is updated to the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.***
