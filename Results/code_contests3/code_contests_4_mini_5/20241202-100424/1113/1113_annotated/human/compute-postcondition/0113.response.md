Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters. If the 9th character `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, which is the 9th character in `row`.***
