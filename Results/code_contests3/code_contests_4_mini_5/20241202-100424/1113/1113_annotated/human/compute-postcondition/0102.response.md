Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the third character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to contain its previous value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`.***
