The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The current state of `res` is that it already contains 11 modified strings. The value of `nRow` is defined as the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. This operation does not affect the other variables (`maxint`, `T`, `t`, and `row`). After executing the code, `res` will contain 12 modified strings.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 12 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, and `nRow` is equal to the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1'.**
