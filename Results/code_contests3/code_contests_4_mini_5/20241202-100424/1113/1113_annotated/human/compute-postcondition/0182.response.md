The variable `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, and since `nRow` is derived from `row`, it will be added as a new element to `res`. The value of `maxint`, `T`, `t`, and `row` do not change, and only the list `res` is affected by the addition of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 12 modified strings after appending `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, and `nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 12 modified strings after appending `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, and `nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.**
