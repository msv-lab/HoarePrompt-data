`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous state of `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, and `nRow` is defined as the result of replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1'. Thus, after execution, `res` will contain 11 modified strings (the original 10 plus the new `nRow`). The values of `maxint`, `T`, `t`, and `row` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and `nRow` is the result of replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1'.**
