The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes `t` test cases where `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10,000. Each test case consists of 9 lines of strings, and each string contains exactly 9 characters, representing digits from '1' to '9'. After processing the input, the function returns a result based on the test cases.
