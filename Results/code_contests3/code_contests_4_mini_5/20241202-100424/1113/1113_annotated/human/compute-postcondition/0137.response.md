The code `nRow += i` appends the character `i` to the string `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is a string representation of the next integer, and `i` is the next character in `row`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be the original string plus the character `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the original string representation of the next integer plus the character `i`.**
