Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
