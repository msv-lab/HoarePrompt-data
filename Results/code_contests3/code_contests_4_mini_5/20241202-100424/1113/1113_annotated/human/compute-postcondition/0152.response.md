`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row` during the first iteration, `nRow` will now contain the single character `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is `i`, `i` is not equal to '9' and is the first character of `row` during the first iteration.
