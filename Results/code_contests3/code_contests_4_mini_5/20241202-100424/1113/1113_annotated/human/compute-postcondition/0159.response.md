The code updates `nRow` by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The previous value of `nRow` has not been defined in the initial state, but it is mentioned that if the third character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` would have been updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. Since the code is now concatenating '1' regardless of the condition, `nRow` will always have '1' added to whatever value it held previously.

Therefore, since `nRow` is modified by adding '1', the output state will reflect that change along with the other unchanged variables.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 3, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'.**
