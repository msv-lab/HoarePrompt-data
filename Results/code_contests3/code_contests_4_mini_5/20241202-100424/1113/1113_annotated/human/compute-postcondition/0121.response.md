Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, and `row` is a string with at least 9 characters. If the third character `i` in `row` is '9', then `nRow` is modified by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
