The code `nRow += i` appends the character `i` to the end of the string `nRow`. Since `i` is the next character in `row`, and `row` has at least one more character remaining, the value of `nRow` changes by adding this new character. The other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`) remain unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending `i`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending `i`.**
