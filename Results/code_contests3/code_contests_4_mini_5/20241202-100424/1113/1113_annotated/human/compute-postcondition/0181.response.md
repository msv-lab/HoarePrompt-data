Given the provided loop code and the initial state, we analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed. The loop processes each character of the `row` string. If the character is '9', the output string `nRow` is appended with '1'. For any other character, that character is directly appended to `nRow`.

Since `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and `nRow` starts as an empty string, the final state of `nRow` will consist of all characters of `row` with each occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'. 

The output state after all iterations of the loop will reflect that `maxint` remains positive infinity, `res` contains the same 11 modified strings, `T` is still greater than or equal to 1, `t` equals the length of `row`, and `nRow` is constructed based on the rules described.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, and `nRow` is the string `row` with every '9' replaced by '1'.**
