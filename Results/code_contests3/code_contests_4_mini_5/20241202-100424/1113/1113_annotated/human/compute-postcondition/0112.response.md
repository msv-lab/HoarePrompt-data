`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is the 9th character in `row` and not equal to '9', `nRow` will now contain the character represented by `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `i` is the 9th character in `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `i` is the 9th character in `row`.**
