According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', hence `nRow` is set to '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after '9' to allow iteration. Since `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and `i` is '9', the next iteration will proceed with the next character in `row`. 

Since `i` is currently '9' and the loop has reached this character, we need to update `i` to the next character in `row` (which is the character immediately following '9'). If '9' is the last character in `row`, the loop will not execute again. However, since we are tasked to prepare for the next execution, we will indicate the next character as `i`.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', `nRow` is updated to '1'**
