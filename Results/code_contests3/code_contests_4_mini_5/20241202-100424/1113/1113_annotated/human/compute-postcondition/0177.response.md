According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `row`. The variable `i` represents the current character being processed in the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', meaning we have already processed the characters up to '9'. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and `t` is equal to the length of `row`, if `i` is the next character after '9', we need to determine if there are more characters to process in `row`. 

If `i` is indeed the last character of `row`, the loop will not execute a second time. However, if there are more characters in `row` to iterate over, we need to set `i` to the next character.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character after the current `i`, and `row` must still have characters left to process. Thus, if `i` is the last character, `t` would remain the same, but if there are characters remaining, we would update `i` to the next character.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, and `i` is updated to the next character in `row` after the current character.**
