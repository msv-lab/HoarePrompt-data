The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the third character in `row`. The previous state of `nRow` is unknown, but it will now include the character represented by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.
