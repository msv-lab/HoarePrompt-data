The variable `nRow` is assigned a new value by appending the string '1' to its previous value. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value. Thus, we can only note that `nRow` has been modified to include '1' at the end. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is modified by appending '1'.**
