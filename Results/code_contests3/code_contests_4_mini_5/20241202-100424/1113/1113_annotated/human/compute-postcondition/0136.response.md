The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string '1'. Since `nRow` is a string representation of the next integer based on the new value of `i`, the original value of `nRow` will have '1' concatenated to the end of it. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is the string representation of the next integer plus '1'.
