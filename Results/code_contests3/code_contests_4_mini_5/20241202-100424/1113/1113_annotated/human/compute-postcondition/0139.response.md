According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`. Given that `row` is a non-empty string, there are still characters left to iterate over.

Since `i` is the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must change to the next character in `row`. If `i` is currently '9', then `nRow` will be the string representation of the next integer plus '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` will be the original string representation of the next integer plus the character `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to set `i` to the next character in the `row`. If `row` has more characters left, `i` will now point to that next character. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least one more character remaining.**
