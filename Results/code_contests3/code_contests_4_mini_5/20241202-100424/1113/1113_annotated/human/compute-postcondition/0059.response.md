According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters in the `row`. If there are more characters remaining after the current character `i`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is updated to include '1'. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain more characters after the current character `i`. If `i` is '9', the next character in `row` must be the subsequent character after '9'. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have more characters after '9', and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
