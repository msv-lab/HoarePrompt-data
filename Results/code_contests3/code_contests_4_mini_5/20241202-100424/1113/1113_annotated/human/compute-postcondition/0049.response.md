According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop will execute for each character in the `row` string. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. Given that `nRow` is currently an empty string, it indicates that `row` should contain at least one character to ensure the loop runs. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed at least once, `row` must be a non-empty string. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` will be set to the first character of `row`. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
