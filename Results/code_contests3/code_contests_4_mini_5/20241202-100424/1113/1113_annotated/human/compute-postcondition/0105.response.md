According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, with the variable `i` starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, since `i` would be 8, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9. As this is the last iteration of the loop, `i` reaching 9 means the loop will not execute again.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 9.**
