Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is the second character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is increased by appending '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
