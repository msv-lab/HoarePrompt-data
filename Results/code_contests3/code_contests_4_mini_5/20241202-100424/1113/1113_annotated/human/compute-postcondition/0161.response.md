Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 3, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and `i` is the third character of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to its previous value.***
