The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This directly affects only the variable `nRow`, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than 9.
