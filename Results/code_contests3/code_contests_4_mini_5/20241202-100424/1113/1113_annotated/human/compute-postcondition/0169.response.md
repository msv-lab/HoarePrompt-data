In this case, `nRow` is assigned the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is originally an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is '9'.
