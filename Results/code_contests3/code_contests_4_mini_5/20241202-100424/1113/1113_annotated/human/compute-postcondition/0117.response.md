Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, and `i` is the second character in `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is the 9th character in `row` concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the concatenation of the 9th and 2nd characters in `row`.***
