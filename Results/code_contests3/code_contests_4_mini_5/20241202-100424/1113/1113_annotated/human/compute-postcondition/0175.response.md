The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i` to it. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', and since `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', `nRow` will now contain '1' followed by that character. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', and `nRow` is updated to '1' followed by `i`.
