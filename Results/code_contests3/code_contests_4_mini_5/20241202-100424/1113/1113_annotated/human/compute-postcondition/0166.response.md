The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This means that regardless of the previous values of other variables, `nRow` no longer holds any value. The other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `nRow`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string.
