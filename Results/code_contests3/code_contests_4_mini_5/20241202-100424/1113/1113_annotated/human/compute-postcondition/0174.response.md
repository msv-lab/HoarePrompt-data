`nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', `nRow` is '11'.
