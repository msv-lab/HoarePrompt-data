The value of `row` is assigned the result of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will now hold the string input provided by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The previous values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is the input string without whitespace, `nRow` is the modified version of `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', `i` is reset to 0.
