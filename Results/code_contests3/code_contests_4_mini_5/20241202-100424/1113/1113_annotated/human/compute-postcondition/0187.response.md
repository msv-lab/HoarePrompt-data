Functionality: ** The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case consists of 9 lines of strings containing digits from '1' to '9'. It replaces all occurrences of '9' in each line with '1' and collects the modified lines into a list. Finally, it outputs the modified strings for all test cases, ensuring that the digit '9' is never present in the output. **
