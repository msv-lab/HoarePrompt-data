The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This action does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 1.
