`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is '1', `i` is '9'**
