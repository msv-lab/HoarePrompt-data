The code snippet `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nRow`. This action overrides any previous value that `nRow` may have had. Prior to this assignment, `nRow` was formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in the input string `row` with '1', but now it is reset to an empty string.

The values of the other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0**.
