`res` is being modified by appending `nRow` to it. Since `res` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `res` will contain one element, which is `nRow`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is the last character in `row`, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'.
