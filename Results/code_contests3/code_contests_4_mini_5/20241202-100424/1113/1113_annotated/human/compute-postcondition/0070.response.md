According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must be a non-empty string. Currently, `row` is defined as the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, so it will be non-empty if there are any characters left after stripping. 

Since `i` is initialized to 1, which does not affect the loop's execution directly, it will be updated to each character in `row` as the loop iterates. Therefore, we need to ensure that `row` is a non-empty string.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one character after stripping whitespace. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 1**
