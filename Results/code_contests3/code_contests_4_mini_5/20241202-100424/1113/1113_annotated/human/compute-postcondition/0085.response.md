The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The list `res` already contains 9 modified strings, and the value of `nRow` is derived from the string `row` by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1', while keeping all other characters unchanged. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated state of `res` after appending `nRow`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged.**
