The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently equal to the 9th character in `row`, it will change from its original value to that value plus '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is now the 9th character in `row` plus '1', and `i` is the second character in `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a string with at least 9 characters, `nRow` is now the 9th character in `row` plus '1', `i` is the second character in `row`**
