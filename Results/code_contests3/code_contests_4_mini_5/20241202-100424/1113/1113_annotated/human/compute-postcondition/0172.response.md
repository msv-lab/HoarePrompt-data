Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, and `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
