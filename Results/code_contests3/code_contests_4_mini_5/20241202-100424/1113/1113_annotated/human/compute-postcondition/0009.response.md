The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of other variables (`maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
