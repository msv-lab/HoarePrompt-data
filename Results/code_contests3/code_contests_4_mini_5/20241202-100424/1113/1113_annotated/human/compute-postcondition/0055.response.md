According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop executes again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, and `nRow` has been updated based on the first character of `row`. Since `i` takes each character in `row`, we need to determine the next character that `i` will take during the next iteration.

If `row` has more characters beyond the current position of `i`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to take the next character in the string, which would be at the subsequent index. 

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have more characters after the current character `i`, and `i` will be the next character in `row`.**
