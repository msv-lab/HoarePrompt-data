Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by appending `i` to it. In both cases, `row` must have more characters after the current character `i`, and `i` will be the next character in `row`.***
