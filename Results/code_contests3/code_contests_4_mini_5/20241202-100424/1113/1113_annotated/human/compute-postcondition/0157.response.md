Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and if the second character of `row` (`i`) is '9', then `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with the second character of `row`.***
