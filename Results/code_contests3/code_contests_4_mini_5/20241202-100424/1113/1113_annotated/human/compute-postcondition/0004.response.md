The code assigns the value of `float('inf')` to the variable `maxint`, which represents positive infinity in floating point representation. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and no other variables are impacted. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity.

Output State: **`maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity**
