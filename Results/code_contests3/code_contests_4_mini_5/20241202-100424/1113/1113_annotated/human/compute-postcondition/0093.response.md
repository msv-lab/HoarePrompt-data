The variable `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is the first character in `row`, the value of `nRow` will now contain that first character. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
