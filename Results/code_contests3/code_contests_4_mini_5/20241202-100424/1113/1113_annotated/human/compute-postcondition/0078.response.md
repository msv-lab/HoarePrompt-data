`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `nRow` is previously updated to `nRow + '1'` and `i` is the next character in `row`. Thus, `nRow` will now contain its previous value concatenated with the character `i`. The values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, and `i` is the next character in `row`.**
