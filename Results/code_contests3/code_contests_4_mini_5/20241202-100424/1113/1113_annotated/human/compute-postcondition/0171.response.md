The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` will now contain the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.
