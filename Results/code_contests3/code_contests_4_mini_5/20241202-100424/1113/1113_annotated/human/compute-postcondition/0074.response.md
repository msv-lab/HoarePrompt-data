The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `nRow` will have the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `nRow + '1'`, `i` is 1 and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `nRow + '1'`, `i` is 1 and `i` is not equal to '9'**
