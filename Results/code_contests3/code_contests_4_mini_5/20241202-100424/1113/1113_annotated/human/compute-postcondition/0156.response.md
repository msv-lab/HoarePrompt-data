The variable `nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`. Since `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` will now contain its previous value plus this second character. The other variables remain unchanged, but `nRow` will be modified accordingly.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, and `nRow` is set to its previous value concatenated with the second character of `row`.**
