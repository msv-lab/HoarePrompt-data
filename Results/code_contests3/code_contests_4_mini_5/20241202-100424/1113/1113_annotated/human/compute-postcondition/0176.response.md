Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 11 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is equal to the length of `row`, `row` is the same non-empty string without whitespace, and `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '11'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to '1' followed by `i`.***
