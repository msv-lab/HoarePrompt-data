Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings (with `nRow` appended), `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string without whitespace, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is set to the value of `i`, where `i` is the first character of `row` during the first iteration and is not equal to '9'.***
