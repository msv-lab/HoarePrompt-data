`nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, but it will now contain whatever its previous value was concatenated with '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 10 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to contain its previous value concatenated with '1'.
