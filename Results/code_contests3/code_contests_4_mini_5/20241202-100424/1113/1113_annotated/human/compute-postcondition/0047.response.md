The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, and the value of `nRow` remains as it was defined before this line. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow` appended, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1', and the loop can still execute a second time if `i` is less than 9.
