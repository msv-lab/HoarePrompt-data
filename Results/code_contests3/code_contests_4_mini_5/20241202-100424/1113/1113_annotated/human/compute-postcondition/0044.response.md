To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop code and its effect on the variable `nRow`. 

The loop processes each character in the string `row`. If the character is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`; otherwise, it appends the character itself to `nRow`. 

Assuming `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute once for each character in `row`. Thus, after all iterations:

- `maxint` remains positive infinity.
- `res` will be a list containing the final value of `nRow`.
- `T` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `t` remains 0.
- `row` remains unchanged as a non-empty input string.
- `nRow` will consist of the characters of `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'.

If `row` contains `m` characters, then `nRow` will be formed by appending either '1' for each '9' or the actual character for any other character.

Assuming the loop executes for all characters in the string:

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1'.**
