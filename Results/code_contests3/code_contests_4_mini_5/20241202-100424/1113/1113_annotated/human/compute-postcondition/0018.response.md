The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the string '1'. However, the initial state does not mention any prior value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is updated but its previous value is unknown.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value which is unknown.**
