Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`.***
