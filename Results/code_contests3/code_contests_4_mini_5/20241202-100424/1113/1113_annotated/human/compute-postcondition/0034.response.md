The code snippet `nRow += i` attempts to concatenate the string representation of `i` to `nRow`. However, since `i` is an integer (specifically 9), this operation would typically raise a TypeError in Python. 

Given that `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is 9, the output should reflect the intention of concatenating `i` to `nRow`, but since Python does not allow concatenation of a string and an integer directly, it results in an error.

Thus, the output would indicate that `nRow` remains unchanged due to the type incompatibility, and we retain the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `nRow` is an empty string; operation fails due to type error and `nRow` remains unchanged.**
