Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`, with `i` being the next character in `row`.***
