According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is at least 1. The values of `maxint` and `res` do not directly influence the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed at least once, `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the loop variable `t` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than or equal to 1, and `t` is 0**
