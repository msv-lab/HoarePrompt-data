The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that '1' is appended to the existing value of `nRow`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `nRow` now contains one more character (the string '1') added to it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but since `row` must have at least one more character remaining for the loop to execute one more time, we can assume that this condition still holds true.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` now contains one additional character '1'.**
