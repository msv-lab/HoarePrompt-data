The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables, including `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, `row`, and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is 1 and equal to '9'.

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is 1 and equal to '9'**.
