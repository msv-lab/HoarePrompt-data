Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'. The loop has executed at least once, thus `row` contains at least 1 character.***
