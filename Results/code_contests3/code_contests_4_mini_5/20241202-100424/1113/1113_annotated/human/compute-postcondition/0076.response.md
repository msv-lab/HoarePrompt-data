According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `row` during the iterations. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is not equal to '9', and since `row` is a non-empty string, there must be more characters left for the loop to continue executing.

Given that `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is not '9', the loop can execute again for the next character in `row`. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be updated to the next character in `row`, and we need to ensure that `nRow` continues to be updated.

State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + '1'`, and `i` is the next character in `row`**
