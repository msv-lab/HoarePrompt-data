Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing 9 modified strings, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 2, `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `nRow` is the string representation of the integer `i`, which is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
