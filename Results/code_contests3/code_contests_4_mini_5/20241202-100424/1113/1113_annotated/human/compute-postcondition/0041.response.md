The variable `nRow` is being appended with the string `'1'`. This operation will not affect the values of `maxint`, `res`, `T`, `t`, or `i`. However, it will change the value of `nRow` by adding the string `'1'` to it. Since `nRow` is a list, after the operation, it will now contain at least 11 elements (assuming it had at least 10 previously).

Output State: **`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is now a list containing at least 11 elements.**
