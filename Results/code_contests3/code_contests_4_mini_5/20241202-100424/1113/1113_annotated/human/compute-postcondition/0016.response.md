Postcondition: ***`maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is an empty list, `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is a non-empty input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' concatenated to the previous value of `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`, which is 0.***
