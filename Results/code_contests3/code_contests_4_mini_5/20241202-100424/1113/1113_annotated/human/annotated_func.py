#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function processes t test cases where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 9 lines of strings, each string containing exactly 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9'.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `maxint` is positive infinity, `res` is a list containing `T * 9` modified strings where all '9's are replaced by '1', `T` is a non-negative integer, `t` is equal to `T - 1` (the last iteration index), `row` is the last non-empty input string, and `nRow` is the modified string corresponding to `row` with all '9's replaced by '1'.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case consists of 9 lines of strings containing digits from '1' to '9'. It replaces all occurrences of '9' in each line with '1' and collects the modified lines into a list. Finally, it outputs the modified strings for all test cases, ensuring that the digit '9' is never present in the output.
