According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a new string from input, it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` is set to 0, which is the initial index for the loop. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `row` needs to have at least one character.

State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `t` is `T`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
