`nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + i`. The value of `nRow` can either be '11' or the first character of `row` concatenated with '1'. Since `i` is '10', when concatenating with a string, it will result in string concatenation rather than arithmetic addition. Therefore:

- If `nRow` is '11', then `nRow + i` results in '1110'.
- If `nRow` is the first character of `row` concatenated with '1' (let's denote the first character of `row` as `c`), then `nRow` becomes `c + '1' + '10'`, which results in `c + '110'`.

So, after evaluating both cases, we find that the value of `nRow` changes based on its initial state. The value of `i` does not affect other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '1110' or `c + '110'`, `i` is '10'.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '1110' or `c + '110'`, `i` is '10'**
