The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res`, `nRow`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `res`, `nRow`, and `i`, while `row` now contains the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace; `i` is 1**
