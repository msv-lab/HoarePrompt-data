Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '111' while `t` remains 'T', and for the loop to execute again `row` must contain at least 2 characters. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to '11' concatenated with `i`, while `t` remains 'T', and for the loop to execute again `row` must contain at least 2 characters.***
