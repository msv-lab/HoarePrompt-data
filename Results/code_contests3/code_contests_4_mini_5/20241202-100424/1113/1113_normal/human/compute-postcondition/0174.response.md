`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. However, `nRow` will be updated to include an additional '1' appended to whatever its current value is. The output state does not change the other variables, so we note the update to `nRow` without knowing its original state. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include another '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is updated to include another '1'**.
