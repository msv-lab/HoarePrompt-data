According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, corresponding to the range defined in the `for` statement. Since the loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will stop executing when `i` reaches 9. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` would be 8 (the last valid index before the loop exits). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9. 

Since the range is defined to allow `i` to take values from 0 to 8, it will not execute again once `i` becomes 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be less than 9.

State: **`nRow` is the string obtained by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1'; `row` is the original input string; `res` now includes `nRow`, `i` is 9, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 9.**
