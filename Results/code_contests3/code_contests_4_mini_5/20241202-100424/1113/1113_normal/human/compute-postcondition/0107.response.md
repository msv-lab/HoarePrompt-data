The code assigns an empty string `''` to the variable `nRow`. This means that `nRow` will no longer contain the string representation of `row` with '9's replaced by '1's. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `row`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is an empty string; `t` remains 'T'; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is an empty string; `t` remains 'T'; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
