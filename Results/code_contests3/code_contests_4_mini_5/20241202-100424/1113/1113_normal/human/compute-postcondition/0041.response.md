The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, the previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will now contain '1' appended to its prior value. The state of `i` and `row` are not affected by this operation, but it is noted that `row` must have at least 4 characters for the loop to execute one more time.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1', `i` is the third character of `row`, `row` has at least 4 characters.**
