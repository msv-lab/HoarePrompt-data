The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, but since the specific values are not provided, we can only state that `nRow` is increased by `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is increased by `i`, `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.**
