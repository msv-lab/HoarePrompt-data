According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is '9' or a character from `row`, and `nRow` is either set to '1' if `i` is '9', or updated to be a string concatenated with the character `i`. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string, the next character for `i` will be the second character in `row`. For the loop to execute again, `row` must have more characters remaining after the current character, and `i` will be updated to the next character in `row`. 

State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the second character of `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must contain at least 2 characters.**
