The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take the input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res`, `nRow`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Since `row` is being assigned a new value based on user input, the state of `row` will now reflect that input string after whitespace has been stripped.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in the last `row` with '1's, `t` is 'T + 1', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is 0.**
