The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '11', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '111'. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '111', `t` remains 'T', and for the loop to execute again `row` must contain at least 2 characters.
