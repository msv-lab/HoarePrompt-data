Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '11', `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. Otherwise, if `i` is not '9', `nRow` is set to '1' plus the value of `i`, `t` is still 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.***
