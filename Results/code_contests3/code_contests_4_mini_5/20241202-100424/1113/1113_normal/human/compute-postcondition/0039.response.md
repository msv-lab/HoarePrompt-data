Postcondition: ***`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i` which is the second character of `row`, a non-empty string with at least 2 characters; if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '11', otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the value of `i` followed by '1'. In the else part, if `i` is '9', `nRow` is set to '1', otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the value of `i` and then `nRow` is concatenated with `i`.***
