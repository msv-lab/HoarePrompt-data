`nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string '1'. The variable `nRow` is modified, but its previous value is not known as it is not defined in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value (which is unknown).

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value (which is unknown).**
