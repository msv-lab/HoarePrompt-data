The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state mentions that `res` contains 9 strings, and `nRow` is formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's. The other variables `t`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. After executing the code, `res` will contain one additional string, which is the value of `nRow`. 

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's, `t` remains 'T', `i` is the last character of `row`, and `row` is unchanged.**
