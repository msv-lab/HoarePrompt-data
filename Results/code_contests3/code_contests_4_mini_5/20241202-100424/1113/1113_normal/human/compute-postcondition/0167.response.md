According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must not be an empty string. Since `row` is described as the input string after stripping whitespace, it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 but will be reassigned to the first character of `row` during the first iteration. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `row` is not empty and adjust `i` accordingly to represent the first character of `row`.

State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is now the first character of `row`**
