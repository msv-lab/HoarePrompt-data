The code `nRow += i` will append the value of `i` to the existing value of `nRow`. The initial state indicates that `row` has at least one more character for the loop to execute, and `i` will be the next character in `row`. This means that `i` has a defined value, which will be added to `nRow`.

Since `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, the state of `res` does not change, and we only focus on the impact of the code on `nRow`. The specific values of `nRow` and `i` are not given, but we can denote the changes accordingly.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is updated by appending the character `i`.**
