The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 10 strings, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's. The other variables (`row` and `i`) are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace; `i` is the last character of `row`; and `nRow` has been appended to `res`.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace; `i` is the last character of `row`.**
