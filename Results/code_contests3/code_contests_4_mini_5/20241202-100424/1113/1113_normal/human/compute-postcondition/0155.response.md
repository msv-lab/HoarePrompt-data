The string `nRow` is assigned the value of '1' appended to it. The previous state of `nRow` is not provided, but it is implied that it was either an empty string or contained other characters. The value of `res` with 10 strings having '9's replaced by '1's is not directly affected by this operation. The variable `i` does not change in this operation either. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to it.**
