`nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of the other variables `t`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `nRow` is an empty string**
