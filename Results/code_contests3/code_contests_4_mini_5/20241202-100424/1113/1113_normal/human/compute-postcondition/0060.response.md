`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with '1'. The initial value of `nRow` can be either '11' or the first character of `row` concatenated with '1'. In both cases, concatenating '1' will result in `nRow` being either '111' or the first character of `row` followed by '11'. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '111' or the first character of `row` followed by '11', `i` is '10'.
Output State: **`nRow` is either '111' or the first character of `row` followed by '11', `i` is '10'**
