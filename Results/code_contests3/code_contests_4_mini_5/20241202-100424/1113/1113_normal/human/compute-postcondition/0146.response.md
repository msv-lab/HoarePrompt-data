The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will hold a string input from the user after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res` and `nRow` are not affected by this line of code. Given that the loop cannot execute again, `i` remains at 9 and does not change. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `row` but keeps the previous states of `res` and `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is added to `res`, `i` is 9, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
