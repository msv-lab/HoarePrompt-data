According to the code, the loop will execute regardless of the state of `T`, since it is controlled by the range which is fixed at 9. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment up to 8 during the loop iterations. The state of `t` does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0. 

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time (which it will, as the range is fixed at 9)**
