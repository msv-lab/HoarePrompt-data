The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is 8, and since `i` is specified as the next element in `row`, its value is unknown but must be a valid integer. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be 8 + `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is 8 + i, `t` remains 'T', `i` is the next element in `row`, and `row` must contain at least 9 elements.**
