`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is set to the first character of `row`, `nRow` will now contain that first character of `row`. The value of `row` is not specifically given, but it is confirmed that it is a non-empty string, meaning `i` is a valid character. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` contains the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` contains the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
