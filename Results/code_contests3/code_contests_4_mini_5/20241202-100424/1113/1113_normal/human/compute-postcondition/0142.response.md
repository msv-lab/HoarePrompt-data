Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by concatenating it with '1', while `t` is 'T + 1' and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, `t` is still 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.***
