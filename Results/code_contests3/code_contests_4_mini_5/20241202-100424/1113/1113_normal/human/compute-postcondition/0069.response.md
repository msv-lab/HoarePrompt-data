The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` is not relevant because it will be overwritten. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `t` is `T`, `i` is 0, and `row` is a new string from input.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `t` is `T`, `i` is 0, and `row` is a new string from input.**
