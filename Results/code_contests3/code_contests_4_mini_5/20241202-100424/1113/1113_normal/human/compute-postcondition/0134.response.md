Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1', `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is `i` concatenated, `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.***
