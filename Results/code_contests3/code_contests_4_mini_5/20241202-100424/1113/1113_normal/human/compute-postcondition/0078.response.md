The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The initial value of `nRow` is '1', and `i` is the next character in `row`, which is not specified but is assumed to be a string. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` will be the concatenation of '1' and `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is now '1' concatenated with `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is now '1' concatenated with `i`**
