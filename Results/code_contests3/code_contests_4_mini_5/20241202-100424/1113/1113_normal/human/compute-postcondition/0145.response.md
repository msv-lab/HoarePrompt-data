According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8, which is the last valid index for the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9, but since `range(9)` only allows values from 0 to 8, the loop cannot execute again. Thus, the loop will not execute a second time unless the range is modified to accommodate an additional iteration.

State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is added to `res`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 9, but the loop cannot execute again since it only runs for i in range(9)**
