The loop processes each character in the input string `row`. For each character, if it is '9', it appends '1' to the string `nRow`. If the character is anything else, it appends that character to `nRow`. 

If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `row` and will transform every '9' into '1', while leaving all other characters unchanged. If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string.

After all iterations of the loop have finished executing: 
- `nRow` will contain the transformed string with '9's replaced by '1's.
- `i` will be equal to the last character of `row` if `row` is not empty, or it will be undefined if `row` is empty.
- `t` remains 0 throughout the loop since it is not modified.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is the last character in `row` if `row` is not empty, otherwise it is undefined.**
