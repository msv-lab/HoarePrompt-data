The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the string `'1'`, which means that the previous integer value of `nRow` (which is 8) will now be concatenated with the string. The result of this operation will turn `nRow` into a string that represents the value `81`. Other variables remain unchanged, and there are no returns in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is now '81', `t` remains 'T', `i` is the next element in `row`, and `row` must contain at least 10 elements.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is now '81', `t` remains 'T', `i` is the next element in `row`, and `row` must contain at least 10 elements.**
