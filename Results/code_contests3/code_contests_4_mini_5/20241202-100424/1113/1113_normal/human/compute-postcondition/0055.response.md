According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. The loop will iterate for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row`. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1', and the next character for `i` will be the second character of `row` (if it exists). If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is set to the first character of `row`, and the next character for `i` will still be the second character of `row` (if it exists). 

Since `row` is a non-empty string, it must have at least one character. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least two characters, and `i` must be the second character in the string.

State: **`nRow` is either '1' or the first character of `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
