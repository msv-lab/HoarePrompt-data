`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the third character in `row`, and since `row` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute a third time, `i` has a specific character value based on that position in `row`. However, the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.**
