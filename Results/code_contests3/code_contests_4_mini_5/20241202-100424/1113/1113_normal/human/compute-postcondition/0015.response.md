`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the first character in `row`, which is a non-empty string and is not equal to '9'. Since `nRow` is not previously defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but it will be updated to include the character `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the first character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i**
