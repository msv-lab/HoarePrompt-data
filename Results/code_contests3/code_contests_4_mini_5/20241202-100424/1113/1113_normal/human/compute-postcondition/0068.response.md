The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The variables `res`, `nRow`, `t`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `row` is now assigned a new value based on user input.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is the last modified string from the final `row`, `t` is `T`, `i` is 0, and `row` is a new string from input.**
