`row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**
