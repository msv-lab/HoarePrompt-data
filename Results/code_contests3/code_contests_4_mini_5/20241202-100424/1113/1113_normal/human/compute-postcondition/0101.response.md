The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is 8, and `i` is the next element in `row`, which is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` will be 8 + `i`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is 8 + i, `t` remains 'T', `i` is the next element in `row`.**
