The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `nRow` is not mentioned, we can assume it is either initialized previously or is in a state that allows concatenation. The character `i` being '9' does not affect the operation. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is in its previous state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'`.**
