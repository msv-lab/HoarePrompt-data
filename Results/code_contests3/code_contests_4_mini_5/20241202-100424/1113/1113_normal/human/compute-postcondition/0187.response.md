Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `T`, which indicates the number of test cases, and processes `T` grids, each consisting of 9 strings of digits from '1' to '9'. For each string, it replaces every occurrence of '9' with '1', and then outputs the modified strings. The function effectively transforms the input grid by altering the character '9' and returns the result as a single output containing all modified rows for each test case. **
