The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This directly affects the value of `nRow`, while the other variables (`res`, `t`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is '', `t` is 'T + 1', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is '', `t` is 'T + 1', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is 0**
