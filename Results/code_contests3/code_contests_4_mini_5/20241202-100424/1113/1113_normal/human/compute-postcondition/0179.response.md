The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is the third character of `row`, but the specific character is not provided. The initial state mentions that `res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, and `row` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute a third time, but this does not affect the operation of the code. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` due to the addition of `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is increased by the third character of `row`, `res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, and `i` is the third character of `row`.**
