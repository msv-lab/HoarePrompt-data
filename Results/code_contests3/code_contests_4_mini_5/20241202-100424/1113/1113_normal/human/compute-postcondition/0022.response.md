`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that the string '1' is appended to the current value of `nRow`. The initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, but since it is being modified, we can say that its value will now include '1' at the end. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.**
