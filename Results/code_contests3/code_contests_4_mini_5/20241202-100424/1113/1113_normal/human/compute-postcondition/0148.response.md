According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the `row` string. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `row` during the iterations. 

Before the loop starts, `res` contains 10 strings, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is initialized to 9, but `i` will be reassigned in the loop. Thus, we need to ensure that `row` is not empty for the loop to execute.

State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must be a non-empty string, and `i` will be assigned the first character of `row` during the loop.**
