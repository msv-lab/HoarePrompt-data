The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to the variable `maxint`. This means that `maxint` will hold the representation of positive infinity in floating-point numbers. The value of `t` and `write` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity**.
