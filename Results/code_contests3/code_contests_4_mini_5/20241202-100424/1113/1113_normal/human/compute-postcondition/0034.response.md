`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, which is not equal to '9', the result will be that `nRow` becomes the string representation of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `row` (not '9').

Output State: **`nRow` is now equal to `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `row` (not '9').**
