The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of the other variables (`row`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string containing at least one character, `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string containing at least one character, `i` is '9'**
