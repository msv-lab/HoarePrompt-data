Postcondition: ***`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to be a string concatenated with the character `i`, where `i` is a character from `row` that is not '9'. The variable `row` remains a non-empty input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` is the first character of `row`.***
