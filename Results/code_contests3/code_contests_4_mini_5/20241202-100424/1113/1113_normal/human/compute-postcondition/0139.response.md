According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to '11', `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.

Since `i` is '9', the loop has already processed this character. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still have characters left to iterate over. Given that `row` remains a non-empty string, we need to consider the next character in `row` after '9'. 

If there are more characters in `row`, `i` will take the value of the next character in the string. Therefore, the next state should reflect the iteration over the next character in the `row`.

State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.**
