The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous state of `nRow` is unknown, but it will now be an empty string. The variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged, so their previous values still apply. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
