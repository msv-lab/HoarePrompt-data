`nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is an empty string, `t` remains 'T', `i` is 8, `row` is unchanged and assigned the value of input after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is '', `t` remains 'T', `i` is 8, `row` is unchanged and assigned the value of input after stripping whitespace.**
