According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character processed in `row`, which is one of the characters in the string.

Assuming that `row` has at least one more character after the character represented by `i`, the next character that `i` will take in the subsequent iteration will be the next character in `row`. 

Given that `i` is currently '9', and `nRow` was updated to '1', we need to consider that `i` will move to the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters, `i` will be assigned the next character.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character beyond the current position of `i`.

State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least one more character after '9'.**
