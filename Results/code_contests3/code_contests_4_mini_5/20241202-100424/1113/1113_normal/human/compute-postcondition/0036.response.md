According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` takes on each character of `row` in sequence. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row`, and if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` has been updated to the value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the next character in the string `row`. Since `row` is non-empty, and `i` is currently the first character, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the second character of `row`. 

Therefore, if `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` will be updated to the second character of `row`, and `nRow` will be set to the value of that second character (if it is not '9').

State: **`nRow` is either '1' if `i` is '9', or `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
