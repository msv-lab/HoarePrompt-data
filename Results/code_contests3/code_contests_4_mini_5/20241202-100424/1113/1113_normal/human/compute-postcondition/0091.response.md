In the given code, `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string `'1'`. The initial value of `nRow` is an empty string (`''`). After executing the statement, `nRow` will become `'1'`. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is '1', `t` remains 'T', `i` is 8, and `row` is non-empty.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is '1', `t` remains 'T', `i` is 8, and `row` is non-empty.**
