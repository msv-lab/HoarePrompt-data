According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`, which needs to be converted to an integer to determine if the loop can run again. 

If `row` is not empty, `i` would represent the last character in `row`, which could potentially be a digit from '0' to '8'. If `row` is empty, `i` is undefined, and the loop cannot execute again.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to run again, `i` must be less than 8.

State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'; `i` is the last character in `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 8.**
