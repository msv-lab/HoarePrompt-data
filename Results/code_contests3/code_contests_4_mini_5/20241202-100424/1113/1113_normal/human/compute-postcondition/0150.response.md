In the initial state, `nRow` is an empty string and `row` is a non-empty string. The code `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` was initially empty, after this operation, it will contain the single character '1'. The values of `res`, `row`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'**
