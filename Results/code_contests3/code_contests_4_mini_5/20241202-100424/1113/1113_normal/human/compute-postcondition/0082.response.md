The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating `i` to it. Since `nRow` is currently '11', the new value of `nRow` will depend on the value of `i`. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to '11' concatenated with `i`, `t` remains 'T', and for the loop to execute again `row` must contain at least 2 characters.
