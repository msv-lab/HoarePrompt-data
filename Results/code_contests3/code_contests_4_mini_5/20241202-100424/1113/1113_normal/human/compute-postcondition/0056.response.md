`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is either '1' or the first character of `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be '1' + '1' (which results in '11') or the first character of `row` + '1'. The output state will thus reflect the possible values of `nRow`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '11' (if it was '1') or the first character of `row` + '1'; `i` remains the second character of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '11' or the first character of `row` + '1'; `i` is the second character of `row`.**
