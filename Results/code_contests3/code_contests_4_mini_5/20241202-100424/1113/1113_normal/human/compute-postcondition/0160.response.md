The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since the specific previous value of `nRow` is unknown, we can only indicate that it is being increased by `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `row` must contain at least 11 elements, and `i` is the next element in `row`; `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `row` must contain at least 11 elements, and `i` is the next element in `row`; `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
