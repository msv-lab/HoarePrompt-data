According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If the loop is to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9'. In this case, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes either '11' or the first character of `row` concatenated with '1'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to '10', and `nRow` will be updated based on the conditions provided: if `i` is '9', `nRow` will either be '11' or the first character of `row` concatenated with '1'. However, if `i` is anything other than '9', `nRow` is concatenated with `i`, which in this case should be the next character in `row`.

Thus, we need to adjust the states accordingly for the next iteration. 

State: **`nRow` is either '11' or the first character of `row` concatenated with '1', `i` is '10', for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 11 characters.**
