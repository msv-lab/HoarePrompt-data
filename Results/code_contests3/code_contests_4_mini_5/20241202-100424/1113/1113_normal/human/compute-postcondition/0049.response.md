According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. Since `nRow` is an empty string, it does not affect the loop execution directly, but the state of `row` is crucial. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is set to 9, but this variable is being redefined in the loop as it takes on each character in `row`. Therefore, the current value of `i` is irrelevant to the loop's execution. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` is a non-empty string. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `row` to contain at least one character. 

State: **`nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty string (contains at least one character), `i` is set to the first character of `row`**
