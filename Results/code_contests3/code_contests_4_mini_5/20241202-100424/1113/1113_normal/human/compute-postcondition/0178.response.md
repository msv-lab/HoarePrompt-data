`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which means that the string '1' is appended to `nRow`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `nRow`, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can state that `nRow` will now include an additional '1' at the end of its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` has an additional '1' appended to it.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the third character of `row`, `nRow` has an additional '1' appended to it.**
