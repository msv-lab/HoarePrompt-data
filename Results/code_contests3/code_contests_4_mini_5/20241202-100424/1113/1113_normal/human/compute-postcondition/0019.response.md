`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the second character in `row`, and `row` must have at least 2 characters for this code to execute. The previous value of `t` is not affected, and `nRow` is assumed to be a variable that exists prior to this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.**
