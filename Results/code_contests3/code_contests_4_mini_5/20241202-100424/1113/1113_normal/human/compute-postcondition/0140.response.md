The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, but we do not have the specific value of `i` at this moment. However, `nRow` will now be one character longer with '1' added at the end. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1', `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` remains a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.
