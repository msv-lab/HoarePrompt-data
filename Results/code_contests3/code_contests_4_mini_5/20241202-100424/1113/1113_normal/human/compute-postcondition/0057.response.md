`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is either '1' or the first character of `row`, and `i` is the second character of `row`, the new value of `nRow` will be a concatenation of its previous value and the character `i`. The output state reflects this change while noting the conditions given for `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '1' or the first character of `row`, and now `nRow` becomes the concatenation of its previous value and `i`, which is the second character of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '1' or the first character of `row`; `nRow` becomes concatenated with `i`, the second character of `row`.**
