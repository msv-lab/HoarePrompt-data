According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`, which means it is at index 1. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, the loop has executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next character in `row`. If `row` has at least 3 characters, then `i` will be updated to the third character, and we need to consider the value of this character. 

Assuming `row` has at least 3 characters, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be set to '11', otherwise, `nRow` will be updated to the value of `i` followed by '1'. 

Thus, after the current iteration, `i` will be the third character in `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 4 characters.

State: **`nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, `i` is the third character of `row`, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 4 characters.**
