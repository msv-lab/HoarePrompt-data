`nRow` is concatenated with the string '1', which means `nRow` will now hold the value '1'. The previous values of `row` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'**
