The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 9 strings, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1's. The values of `t` and `row` do not affect this operation. After executing the append, `res` will contain one additional string, which is `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is added to `res`**
