The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. Since `row` must have at least one more character after '9' for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is an existing character from `row`. The previous state of `nRow` is not given, but it is affected by the addition of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
