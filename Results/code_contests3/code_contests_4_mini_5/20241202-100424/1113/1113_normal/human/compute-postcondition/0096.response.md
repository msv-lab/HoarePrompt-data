The code attempts to append the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`, which is currently an integer (8). Since this operation will not change the integer value of `nRow`, but rather will result in an error due to type mismatch, we will assume a conceptual understanding instead. The values of other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is still 8, `t` remains 'T', `i` is the next element in `row`, and `row` must contain at least 9 elements, but an error would occur due to the incompatible operation.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is still 8, `t` remains 'T', `i` is the next element in `row`, and `row` must contain at least 9 elements, but an error would occur.**
