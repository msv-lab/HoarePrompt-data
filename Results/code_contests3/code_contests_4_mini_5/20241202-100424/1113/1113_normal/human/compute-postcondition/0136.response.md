`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1' + '1', which results in '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '11', `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '11', `t` is 'T + 1', and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace.**
