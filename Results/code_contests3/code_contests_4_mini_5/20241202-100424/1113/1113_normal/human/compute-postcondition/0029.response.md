The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` was a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', but now it has been reset to an empty string. The values of `i` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is `''`, `i` is the last character in `row`, and `row` is the input string after stripping.

Output State: **`nRow` is `''`, `i` is the last character in `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping**
