`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `T` is determined by user input, and it will be an integer. The other variables (`t`, `write`, `maxint`, and `res`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer.**
