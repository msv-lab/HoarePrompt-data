The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of the string '1' being concatenated to its current value. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `nRow`, so we assume it holds an initial value (which may or may not be defined). The string `'1'` is added to whatever value `nRow` previously had.

The states of other variables, including `res`, `row`, and `i`, are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value; `res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `row` must contain at least 11 elements for the loop to execute a second time; `i` is the next element in `row`.**
