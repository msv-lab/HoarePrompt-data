The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`, which means that `nRow` will no longer hold any previously assigned value. The values of `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is an empty string; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace; `i` is 1.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's; `nRow` is an empty string; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace; `i` is 1**
