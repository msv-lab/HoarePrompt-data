The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` would initially be '1', and after the operation, it would become '11'. If `i` is any other character (which is the second character of `row`), then `nRow` would update to whatever value `i` holds, plus '1'. Since `nRow` can either be '1' or the value of `i` followed by '1', the output state depends on the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is either '11' if `i` is '9', or `nRow` is updated to the value of `i` followed by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters; `i` is the second character of `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is either '11' if `i` is '9', or `nRow` is updated to the value of `i` followed by '1'; `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters; `i` is the second character of `row`.**
