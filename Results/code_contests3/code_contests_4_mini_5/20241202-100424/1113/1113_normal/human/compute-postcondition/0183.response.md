The loop executes a total of 9 times, processing input strings and modifying the `res` list by appending new strings formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1'. After all iterations, `res` will contain the original 9 strings plus the new strings created in each iteration.

After all iterations of the loop, `res` will contain 9 original strings with '9's replaced by '1's, and 9 new strings formed from the last 9 inputs, also with '9's replaced by '1's. The variable `nRow` will hold the last processed string with '9's replaced by '1's, `row` will be the last input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` will be the last character of that input string.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 strings with all '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in the last input `row` with '1's, `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is the last character of `row`.**
