According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least one more character, and the loop is iterating over its characters. If the last character processed was `i`, which was '9', then `nRow` would have been updated to '1' appended to its previous value. If `i` was not '9', then `nRow` would have been updated by appending the character `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `i` must now take the next character in `row`. Therefore, `row` must have at least one more character remaining for the loop to continue. If the last character processed was the last character of `row`, then the loop cannot execute again.

Assuming the last value of `i` was not the last character of `row`, we can say that `i` would take on the next character in `row`. 

State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `row` has at least one more character, for the loop to execute again `nRow` is updated with the next character in `row`.**
