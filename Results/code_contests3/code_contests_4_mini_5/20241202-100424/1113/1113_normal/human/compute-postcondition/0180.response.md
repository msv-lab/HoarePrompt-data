Postcondition: ***`res` contains 11 strings with '9's replaced by '1's. If `i` is the third character of `row` and it equals '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending an additional '1' to it. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the third character of `row`, while `res` remains the same and `i` is still the third character of `row`.***
