According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop will execute one more time for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `t` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to the third character in `row`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` will be the third character in `row`.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the third character in `row`, for the loop to execute a third time `row` must have at least 3 characters.**
