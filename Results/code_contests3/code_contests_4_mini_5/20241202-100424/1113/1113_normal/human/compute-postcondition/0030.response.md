According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row` variable. The `row` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute at least once. Currently, `nRow` is an empty string (`''`), and `i` is the last character in `row`, which implies that `row` should have at least one character. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `row` must be a non-empty string, and since `i` is the last character of `row`, it should be adjusted to reflect the first character of `row` when the loop starts.

State: **`nRow` is '', for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
