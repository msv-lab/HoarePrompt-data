According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character in `row`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be updated to the next character in the `row`. 

Since `i` is currently the first character, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be the second character in `row`. The length of `row` must be at least 2 for this to happen.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the second character in `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 characters.**
