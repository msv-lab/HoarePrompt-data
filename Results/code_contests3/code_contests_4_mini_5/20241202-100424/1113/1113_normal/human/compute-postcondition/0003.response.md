The code assigns the `write` variable to `sys.stdout.write`, which allows for writing output to the standard output. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the state of the `input` function is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`**
