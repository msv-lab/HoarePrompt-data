According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 'T', which indicates that the loop has executed `T` times. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be incremented, and thus `t` would be `T + 1`.

State: **`res` contains 9 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in the last `row` with '1's, `t` is 'T + 1', `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` is the last character of `row`.**
