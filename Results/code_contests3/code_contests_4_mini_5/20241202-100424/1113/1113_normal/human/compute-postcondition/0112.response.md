`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `i`. The value of `i` is the first character of `row`, and since `i` is not equal to '9', it can be any other character. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the character `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings with '9's replaced by '1's, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `t` is 'T', `row` is not empty, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
