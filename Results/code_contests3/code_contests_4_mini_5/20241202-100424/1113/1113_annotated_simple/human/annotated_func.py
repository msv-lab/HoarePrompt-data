#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 9 lines of exactly 9 characters, where each character is a digit from '1' to '9' representing a valid sudoku solution.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is `T - 1`, `res` is a list containing `9 * T` strings with '9's replaced by '1's for each corresponding user input, `row` is the last non-empty string input by the user, `nRow` is the transformed string of `row`, and `i` is the last character of `row`.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, each representing a Sudoku solution formatted as 9 lines of 9 characters (digits from '1' to '9'). It processes each test case by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input rows and then outputs the transformed rows. The function does not validate the Sudoku solutions and assumes all input is correctly formatted as per the specifications.
