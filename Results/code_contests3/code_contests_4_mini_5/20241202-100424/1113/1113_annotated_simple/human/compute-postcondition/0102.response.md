Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 10 strings. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i` to its previous value. In both cases, `row` must have at least one more character, and `i` must be the next character in `row`.***
