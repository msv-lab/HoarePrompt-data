The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its current value. The initial state indicates that `nRow` will be modified, but the previous value of `nRow` is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated by appending '1'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` has been updated by appending '1'.**
