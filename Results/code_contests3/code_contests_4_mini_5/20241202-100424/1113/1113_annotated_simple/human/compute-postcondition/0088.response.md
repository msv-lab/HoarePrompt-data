The code `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nRow`. This means that the previous value of `nRow`, which was formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1', is overwritten and lost. The other variables, such as `res`, `row`, and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is an input string, `nRow` is now an empty string, and `i` is 8; the loop has completed all iterations and will not execute again.
