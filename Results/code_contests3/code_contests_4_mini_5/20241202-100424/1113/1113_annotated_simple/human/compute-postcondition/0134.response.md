Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings and `row` is the user's input string with at least 2 characters. If the second character `i` of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the string concatenated with `i`, where `i` is the second character of `row` and is not equal to '9'.***
