The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` represents the next character in `row`, it adds that character to `nRow`. The state of `res` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.**
