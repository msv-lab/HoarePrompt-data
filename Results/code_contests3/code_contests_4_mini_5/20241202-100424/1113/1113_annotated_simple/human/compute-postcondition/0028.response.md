The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means `row` will now hold the original user input without any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in the original `row` with '1', and `i` is 9 for the loop to not execute again.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9 for the loop to not execute again.**
