The variable `nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i` to it. The value of `i` is defined as the second element in `row`, and `nRow` is initially set based on the value of the first element in `row`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` after adding `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the second element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated based on the first element in `row` plus `i`.**
