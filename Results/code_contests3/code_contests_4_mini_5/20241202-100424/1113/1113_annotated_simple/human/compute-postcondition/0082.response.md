The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the value of `i`, which is the third character in the string `row`. However, the initial state does not provide any previous value for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its exact value after the increment. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
