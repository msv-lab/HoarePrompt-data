The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the transformed string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the transformed string, `i` is 9**
