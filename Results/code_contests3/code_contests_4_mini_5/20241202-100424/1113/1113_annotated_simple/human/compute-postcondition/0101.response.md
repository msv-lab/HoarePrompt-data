The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. As `row` has at least one more character, `i` will have a specific value corresponding to that character. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will be updated to include `i`. The output state will reflect the changes made to `nRow` while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'), `row` must have at least one more character, `nRow` is updated by adding the character `i` to its previous value.**
