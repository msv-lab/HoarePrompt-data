The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of its previous state plus the string '1'. However, the initial state does not provide information about `nRow`, so we only know that `nRow` will append '1' to whatever its previous value was. The other variables (`res`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings; `row` is a non-empty string; `i` is the second character in `row`; and `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings; `row` is a non-empty string; `i` is the second character in `row`; `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'.**
