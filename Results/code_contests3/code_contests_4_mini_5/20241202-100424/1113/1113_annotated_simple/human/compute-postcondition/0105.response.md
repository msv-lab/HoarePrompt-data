According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` from 0 to 8 (inclusive), which means it will execute a total of 9 times. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, which is the last valid value for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Since `i` is currently 8, it will become 9 for the next iteration.

However, since the loop is defined to run for `i` in the range of 9, when `i` is 9, the loop will not execute again as it exceeds the upper limit of the range. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than 9.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the concatenation of all characters from `row` with '1' replacing every occurrence of '9' in it, `i` is 9, for the loop to execute one more time `nRow` must be appended to `res` and `i` must be less than 9.**
