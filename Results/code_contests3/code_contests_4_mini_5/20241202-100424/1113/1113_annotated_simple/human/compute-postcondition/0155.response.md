The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of the current `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, we infer that it could hold any string value. The other variables `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is still a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is still a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.**
