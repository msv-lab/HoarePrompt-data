According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the characters in the `row`. If `row` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty, and `i` is the second character in `row`. 

To determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- If `i` is the second character, it means that there is at least one more character after it. 
- The next character in `row` will be accessed for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to update `i` to the next character in `row`, which will be the third character. Additionally, `nRow` will either be updated based on whether the next character is '9' or not.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the third character in `row`**
