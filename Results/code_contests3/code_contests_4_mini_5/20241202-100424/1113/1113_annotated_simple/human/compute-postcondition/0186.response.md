The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a specific number of test cases defined by an integer `t`, which is constrained such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of 9 lines, where each line contains exactly 9 characters. Each character is a digit from '1' to '9', representing a valid sudoku solution. The return value is not specified in the provided output information, but the function likely validates the sudoku solutions or performs some operations based on them. 

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases of sudoku solutions, each consisting of 9 lines with 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9', where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
