The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. However, there is no previous value provided for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its exact state after the operation. The values of `res`, `row`, and `i` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `row` has at least 13 characters, `i` is the 13th character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `row` has at least 13 characters, `i` is the 13th character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.**
