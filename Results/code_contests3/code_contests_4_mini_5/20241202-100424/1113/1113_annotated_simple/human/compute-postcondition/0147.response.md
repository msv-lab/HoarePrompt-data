`nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` is a transformed string, but it is overwritten by the empty string. The states of the other variables (`res`, `row`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9**
