According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `row`. If `row` is not empty, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is not empty, and `i` is currently the last element of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more element. After the current iteration, `i` will be updated to the next element in `row`, and `nRow` will either be incremented or concatenated based on the value of `i`.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is not empty, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more element, `i` will be the next element in `row`.**
