The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 9 strings, and `nRow` is formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1'. The last character of `row`, stored in `i`, does not affect the operation of appending the new string to the list. Therefore, the length of `res` increases by one, and the content of `res` is updated with the new value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1', `i` is the last character in `row`.**
