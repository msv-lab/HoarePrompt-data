The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The other variables `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` must have at least one more character, `i` must be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` must have at least one more character, `i` must be the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by adding '1' to its previous value.**
