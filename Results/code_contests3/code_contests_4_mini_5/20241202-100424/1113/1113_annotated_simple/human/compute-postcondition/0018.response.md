`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `nRow`, but it is implied that it holds some value. The values of `t` and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` is now the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` is now the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'.**
