The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is less than the length of `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'.
