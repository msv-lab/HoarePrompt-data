The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its current value. The value of `nRow` is dependent on the first element of `row`, which is not specified but is non-empty. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will be the previous value plus '1'. The other variables `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the second element in `row`, `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1'.**
