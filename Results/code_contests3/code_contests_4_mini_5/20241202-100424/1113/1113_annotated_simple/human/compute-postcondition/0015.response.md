The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is 0 (as stated in the initial conditions), the value of `nRow` is incremented by 0. The values of other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` remains unchanged because we added 0 to it.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` remains unchanged.**
