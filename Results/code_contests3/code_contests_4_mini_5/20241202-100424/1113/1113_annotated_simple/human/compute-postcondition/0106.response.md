The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `res`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is the input string, `nRow` is the concatenation of all characters from `row` with '1' replacing every occurrence of '9', and `i` is 9.
