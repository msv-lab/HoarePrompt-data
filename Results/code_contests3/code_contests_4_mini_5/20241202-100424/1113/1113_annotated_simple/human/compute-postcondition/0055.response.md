According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string or list, it contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first element in `row`, and the loop will continue iterating as long as there are more elements in `row` to process.

If `i` is the first element in `row`, after processing `i`, the next `i` will be the second element in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least two elements.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the second element in `row` for the loop to execute a second time, and `nRow` is updated based on the value of the first element in `row`.**
