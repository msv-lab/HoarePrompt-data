The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the first character in `row`, which is not equal to '9'. However, the initial state does not provide the previous value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine the final value of `nRow`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and must not be empty, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'; `nRow` is updated to include `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and must not be empty, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'; `nRow` is updated to include `i`.**
