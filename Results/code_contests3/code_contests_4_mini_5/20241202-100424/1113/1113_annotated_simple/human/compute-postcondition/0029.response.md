The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The previous value of `nRow` was the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1', but now it is reset to an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `row`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9**
