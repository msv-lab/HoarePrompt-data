`res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings, and `nRow` is the transformed string resulting from replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. The `append` method adds `nRow` to the end of the list `res`. The previous values of `res` remain unchanged except for the addition of `nRow`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings plus the new `nRow`, `row` is the user's input string, `nRow` is the transformed string, and `i` is the last character of `row` if `row` is not empty.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `row` is the user's input string, `nRow` is the transformed string, `i` is the last character of `row` if `row` is not empty.**
