According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `row`. If `row` has at least 4 characters, the loop can execute again for the fourth character. At the end of the last iteration, `row` has at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least 4 characters, and `i` will be the fourth character of `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings, `row` is the user's input string with at least 4 characters, and `i` is the fourth character of `row`.**
