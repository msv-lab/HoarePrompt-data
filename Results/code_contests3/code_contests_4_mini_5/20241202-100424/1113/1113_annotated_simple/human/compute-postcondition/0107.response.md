The code snippet initializes `nRow` as an empty string. Since `nRow` was previously defined as the concatenation of all characters from `row` with '1' replacing every occurrence of '9', this initialization effectively clears its value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is the input string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9.**
