Postcondition: ***`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`). If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '11'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to '1' followed by the character `i`, while `row` remains a non-empty string and `i` continues to represent the next character in `row`.***
