To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the code and the initial conditions.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For every character:

- If the character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`.
- If the character is not '9', that character is appended to `nRow`.

After all iterations of the loop, `nRow` will consist of all characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'.

Given that `res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings (which remains unchanged during the loop), and `row` is assumed to be a non-empty string, we can conclude that:

- `nRow` will be the result of transforming `row` based on the specified conditions.
- `i` will have taken the value of the last character in `row` after the loop completes.

Therefore, the final output state will be:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the last character of `row`.**
