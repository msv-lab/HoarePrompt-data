To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the code provided.

The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `row`. For each iteration:
- If the character `i` is '9', it appends '1' to the string `nRow`.
- If the character `i` is not '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

After all iterations:
- If `row` contains characters, `nRow` will consist of the original characters from `row`, but with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'.
- If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string.

Therefore, after the loop has executed for all characters in `row`, the output state is that `nRow` will contain the modified string based on the conditions outlined, while `t` and `i` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1'.**
