The code `nRow += i` increments `nRow` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next element in `row`, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but it is assumed to be a valid numerical value since `row` is not empty. The initial values of `t` and `row` do not affect the operation of this specific line. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `nRow` by `i`, while the previous state of `nRow` is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`**
