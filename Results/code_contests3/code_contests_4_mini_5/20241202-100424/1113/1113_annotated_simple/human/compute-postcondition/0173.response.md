According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in `row`. If the loop executes again, it means there is at least one more character in `row` that has not yet been processed. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 11 transformed strings, which suggests that the loop has already iterated over 11 characters of `row`. 

Since `nRow` is updated based on the value of `i`, and `i` must represent the next character in `row`, we need to determine the state after processing the current `i`. If `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to the value of `i`. 

If `row` has more characters beyond the current one, then the next value of `i` would be the 12th character, and the loop can execute once more. Therefore, the state needs to reflect the current conditions and the next expected values for `i` and `nRow`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 12 characters, `i` is the 12th character of `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly based on the value of `i`.**
