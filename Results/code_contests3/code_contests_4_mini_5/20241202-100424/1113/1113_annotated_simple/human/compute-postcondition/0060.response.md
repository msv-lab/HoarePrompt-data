`nRow` is assigned the value of the current `nRow` plus the string '1'. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state. The values of `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the third element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the third element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.**
