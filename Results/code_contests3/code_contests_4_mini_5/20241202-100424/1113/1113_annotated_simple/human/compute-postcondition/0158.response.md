According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`, and since `row` is still a non-empty string, there is at least one character remaining for the loop to process. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to include the character `i`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the next character in `row`, and there must be at least one more character in `row` after the current `i`. Thus, if `i` is not the last character of `row`, the next character must be processed.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still contain at least one more character after `i`.**
