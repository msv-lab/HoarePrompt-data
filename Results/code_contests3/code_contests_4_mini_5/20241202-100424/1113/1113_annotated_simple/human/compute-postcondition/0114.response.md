According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is equal to '9' which means `nRow` has been updated to '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character from `row`. 

Assuming `row` has at least one more character beyond the current one (which is '9'), the next value of `i` will be the character after '9' in `row`. If `row` had 10 characters, `i` would now correspond to the next character at index 10 (if it exists). 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `nRow` will still reflect the latest update which is '1', and `i` will be the next character in `row`.

State: **`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '1'**.
