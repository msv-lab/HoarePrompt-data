According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means if `row` has at least 10 characters, the loop can execute one more time for the character at the next index. 

Since `i` is '9', for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least 10 characters, and `i` will represent the next character in `row`, which would be `i` equal to the character at the index following '9'. If `row` has at least 11 characters, then `i` would be the character at index 10.

State: **`res` contains 10 strings, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 11 characters, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'.**
