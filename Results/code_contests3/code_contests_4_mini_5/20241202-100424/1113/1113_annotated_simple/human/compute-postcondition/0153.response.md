Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is redefined in the loop, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1' appended to its previous value. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`.***
