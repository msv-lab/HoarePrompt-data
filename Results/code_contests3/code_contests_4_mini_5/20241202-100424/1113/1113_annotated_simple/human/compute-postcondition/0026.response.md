The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The variable `res` is affected by this operation, but the states of `t` and `row` remain unchanged. Since `nRow` is derived from `row`, its value is determined by the original user input with whitespace stripped and with each '9' replaced by '1'. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1', and `nRow` has been added to `res`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1', and `nRow` has been added to `res.**
