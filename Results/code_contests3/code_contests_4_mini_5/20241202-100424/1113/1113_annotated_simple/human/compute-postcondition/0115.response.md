`nRow` is assigned the value of '1' concatenated with '1', resulting in '11'. The previous value of `nRow` was '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '11'.
Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '11'**.
