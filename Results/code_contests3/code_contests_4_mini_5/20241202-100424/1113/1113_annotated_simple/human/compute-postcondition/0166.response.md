The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This operation does not affect any of the other variables: `res` remains a list containing 11 transformed strings, `nRow` changes from its previous value to an empty string, `row` retains the value of the input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` remains 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 9**
