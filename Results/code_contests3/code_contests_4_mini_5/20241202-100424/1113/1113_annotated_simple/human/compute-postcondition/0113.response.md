Postcondition: ***`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to the concatenation of its previous value and `i`, where `i` is any value that is not the string '9'.***
