According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string or list, the loop can execute again for the next character or element in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element in `row`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the third element in `row`, and the loop should still have `row` available as a non-empty string or list.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the third element in `row`.**
