The value of `nRow` is modified by appending the character `i` to it. Since `nRow` is currently '1' and `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` will now be '1' followed by the value of `i`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '1' followed by the character `i`.**
