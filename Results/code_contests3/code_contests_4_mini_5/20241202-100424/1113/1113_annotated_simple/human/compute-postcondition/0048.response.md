The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `row`, or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9**
