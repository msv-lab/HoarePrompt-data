The code `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nRow`, replacing its previous value. The previous value of `nRow` was the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1', but now it is reset to an empty string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings, `row` is the user's input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `T` is greater than 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings, `row` is the user's input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `T` is greater than 9**.
