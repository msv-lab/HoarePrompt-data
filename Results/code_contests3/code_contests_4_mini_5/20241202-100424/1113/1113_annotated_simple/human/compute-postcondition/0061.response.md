`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The previous value of `i` is known (as it is the third element in `row`), but the value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is updated with the addition of `i`, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the third element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to `nRow + i`.**
