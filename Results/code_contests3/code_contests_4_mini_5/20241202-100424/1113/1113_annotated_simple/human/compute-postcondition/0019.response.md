The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is the next element in `row`, which is not specified but is necessary for the operation. The variable `t` remains unchanged at 0, and since `row` is not empty, the loop can continue to execute. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is incremented by the next element in `row`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is not empty, `nRow` is incremented by the next element in `row**
