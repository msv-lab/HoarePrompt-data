`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'. The value of `nRow` is updated, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, and thus the output state will reflect that `nRow` is updated with the addition of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings, `row` must have at least 11 characters, and `nRow` is updated with the addition of `i`.**
