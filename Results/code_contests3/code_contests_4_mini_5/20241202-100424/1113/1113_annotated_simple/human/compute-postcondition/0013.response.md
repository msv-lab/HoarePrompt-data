The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, so we cannot determine its final value after the operation. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `i` is '9', `row` is not empty, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is '9', `row` is not empty, `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
