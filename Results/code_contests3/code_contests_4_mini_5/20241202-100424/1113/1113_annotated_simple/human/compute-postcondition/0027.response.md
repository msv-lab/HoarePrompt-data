According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 8 (as it would have been incremented from 7 in the previous iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9, at which point it would no longer satisfy the condition for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is 9 for the loop to not execute again.**
