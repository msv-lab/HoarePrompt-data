According to the code, the loop will iterate over the variable `row`, which contains the new user input stripped of whitespace. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must not be an empty string. Therefore, it needs to be ensured that `row` contains at least one character. 

Before the loop starts, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `T` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `t` is 1. However, the key variable affecting the execution of the loop is `row`. 

So, for the loop to execute the first time, `row` should not be an empty string, and `i` will be the first character in `row`. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`**
