According to the code, the loop execution depends on the contents of `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`, and at the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row`. If `row` is not empty, there are more characters to process. 

Since `i` is the first character in `row`, after the current iteration, `i` will be updated to the next character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must still contain characters. After processing the first character, `i` will be the second character in `row`.

The conditions for `nRow` are also dependent on the character `i`. If `i` is '9', then '1' is appended to `nRow`. Otherwise, `nRow` includes `i`, which is not '9'. 

Thus, if `row` has characters remaining, the next state will reflect that `i` is now the second character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated based on the new `i` value.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the second character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated based on whether this new `i` is '9' or not.**
