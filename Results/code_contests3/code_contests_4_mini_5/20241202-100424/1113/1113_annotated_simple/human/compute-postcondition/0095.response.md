According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop will execute again for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, since `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is either '9' or something else, we need to determine the status of `i` and `nRow`. 

If `i` is '9', then for the loop to continue, `nRow` has been updated to '1', and `i` would remain at '9'. However, if `i` is not '9', then `nRow` would be '0', and `i` would be less than '9'.

Thus, if `i` was '9', the next iteration will still have `nRow` as '1' and `i` as '9'. If `i` was not '9', then `i` would increment to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` would be '0' as per the stated logic.

Assuming `row` contains more than 9 characters, the next state must reflect this increment of `i`. 

Since the task does not specify what value `i` is at the beginning (whether it's '9' or something else), we can summarize the possible states:

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than the length of `row`, and `nRow` will be updated accordingly.**
