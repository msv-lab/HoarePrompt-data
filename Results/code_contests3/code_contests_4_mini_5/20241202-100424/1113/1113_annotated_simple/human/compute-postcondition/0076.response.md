According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character in `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string. The loop will continue executing for each character in `row`.

Since `i` is the first character in `row`, after the first iteration, it will move to the second character in `row` for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after the first character.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the second character in `row`, and for the loop to execute a second time `row` must contain at least 2 characters.**
