`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, the result of this operation will be that `nRow` becomes the string `'1'`. The values of the other variables, `res` and `row`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now '1', `i` is 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is now '1', `i` is 9**
