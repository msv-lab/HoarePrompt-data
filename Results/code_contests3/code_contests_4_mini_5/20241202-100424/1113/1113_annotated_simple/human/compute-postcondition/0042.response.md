The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value of `i`, which is the third character in `row`. The value of `t` remains unaffected, and the state of `row` is not altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the third character in `row`, `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`**
