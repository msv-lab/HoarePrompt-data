The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. The initial state of `res`, `row`, `i`, `T`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings formed by replacing each '9' in the corresponding user inputs with '1', `row` is the new user input stripped of whitespace for the next iteration, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `T` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `t` is 1.
