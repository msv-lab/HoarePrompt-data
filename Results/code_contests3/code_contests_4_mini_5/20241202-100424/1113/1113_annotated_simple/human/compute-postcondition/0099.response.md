According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it can contain at least one character. If the loop executes again, the next character in `row` will be processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', meaning the loop executed for the last character of the string. In this case, since `i` is '9', `nRow` will be updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to consider that there are no more characters left in `row` for the loop to execute, so `i` will be the next character, which will not exist. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least one more character after '9'.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'), `row` must have at least one more character, and `i` must be the next character in `row`**.
