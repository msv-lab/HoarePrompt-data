Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.***
