The variable `nRow` is being appended with the string '1'. However, the value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value or the final value after the operation. The other variables `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` has '1' appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped and not empty, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` has '1' appended to it.**
