The code `nRow += '1'` concatenates the string '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. However, since `nRow` is not mentioned in the initial state, its previous value is unknown. The variable `t` remains 0, and `row` is still not empty, but since the operation does not affect `t` or `row`, the output state will reflect the unknown value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is not empty, and `nRow` is the previous value concatenated with '1' (previous value unknown)**
