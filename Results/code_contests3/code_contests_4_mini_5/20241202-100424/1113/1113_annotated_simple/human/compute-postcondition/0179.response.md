`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the 13th character of `row`. The value of `nRow` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine its previous value. The states of the other variables, `res` and `row`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `row` has at least 13 characters, and `i` is the 13th character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `row` has at least 13 characters, `i` is the 13th character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
