`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.**
