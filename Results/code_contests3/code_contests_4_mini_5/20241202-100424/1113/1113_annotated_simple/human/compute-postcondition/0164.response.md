According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`, which means `i` is currently 8 (since the loop iterates from 0 to 8). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 9 for the loop to execute a second time**.
