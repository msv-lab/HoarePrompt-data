According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. If there are more characters in `row`, the loop will execute one more time for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string and `i` is the second character in `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to the next character in `row`. If `row` has at least 3 characters, `i` will be the third character in `row`. Consequently, the state should reflect that `i` is now updated to the next character, and `row` must still be a non-empty string.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`**.
