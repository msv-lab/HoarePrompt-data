The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes the original user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of the other variables (`t`, `nRow`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the original `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `i` is 9.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is the original user input with whitespace stripped, `nRow` is the original `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `i` is 9**.
