The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The initial value of `nRow` is an empty string (`''`), so after execution, `nRow` becomes `'1'`. The other variables, including `res` and `row`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `i` is equal to '9'**
