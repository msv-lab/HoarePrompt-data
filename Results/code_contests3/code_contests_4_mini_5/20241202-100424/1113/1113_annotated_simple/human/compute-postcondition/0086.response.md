According to the code, the loop is designed to execute a total of 9 times, as it iterates over the range of 9. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently the last character for the last iteration and the loop will increment `i` for the next iteration, `i` will take on a new value for the next execution, which will be 1 greater than its current value. However, since `i` is defined as the last character in `row`, which corresponds to the final iteration (when `i` would be 8), it means the next value will be 9, but the loop will not execute for that value since the range is from 0 to 8 (inclusive).

Thus, the loop cannot execute again. The state at the end of the last iteration means that the loop has reached its limit.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1', `i` is 8; the loop has completed all iterations and will not execute again.**
