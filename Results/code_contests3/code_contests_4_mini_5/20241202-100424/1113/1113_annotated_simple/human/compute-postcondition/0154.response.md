According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is redefined for each character in `row`. Since `i` is currently defined in the loop, we need to consider the next character in the string for the loop to execute one more time. 

Given that `row` is a non-empty string and `i` will take on the next character in the string during the next iteration, we need to determine what that character is. If the current `i` was the last character in `row`, the loop would not execute again. However, since `i` is redefined in the loop, we must assume that there is at least one more character available for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is currently defined as one of the characters in `row`, if `row` has more characters left, then in the next iteration, `i` will take the next character from `row`. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `row` is still a non-empty string.**
