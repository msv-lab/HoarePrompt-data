According to the code, the loop execution depends on the content of the `row` variable. In order for the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character (i.e., it should not be an empty string). The variable `i` will take on the value of the first character in `row` during the first iteration.

Given that `t` is 0 and `nRow` is an empty string, these variables are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop. The important state to ensure is that `row` is not empty.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is the first character of `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must not be empty and `i` is 0**
