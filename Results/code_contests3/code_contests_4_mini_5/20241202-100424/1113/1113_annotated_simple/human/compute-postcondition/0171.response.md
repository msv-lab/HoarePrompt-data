The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', the result of the operation will be that `nRow` becomes equal to the value of `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row`, `i`, is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is now equal to `i`, `row` is a non-empty string, and the first character of `row`, `i`, is not equal to '9'.**
