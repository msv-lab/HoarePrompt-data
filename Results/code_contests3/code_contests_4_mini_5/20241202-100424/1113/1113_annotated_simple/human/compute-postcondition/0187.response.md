Functionality: ** The function accepts a number of test cases `t`, each representing a Sudoku solution formatted as 9 lines of 9 characters (digits from '1' to '9'). It processes each test case by replacing all occurrences of '9' with '1' in the input rows and then outputs the transformed rows. The function does not validate the Sudoku solutions and assumes all input is correctly formatted as per the specifications. **
