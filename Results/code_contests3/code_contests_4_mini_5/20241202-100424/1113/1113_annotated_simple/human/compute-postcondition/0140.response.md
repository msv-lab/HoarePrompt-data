The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to `nRow`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine the exact result of this operation. The values of `res`, `row`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings, `row` is the user's input string with at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 transformed strings, `row` is the user's input string with at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1'.**
