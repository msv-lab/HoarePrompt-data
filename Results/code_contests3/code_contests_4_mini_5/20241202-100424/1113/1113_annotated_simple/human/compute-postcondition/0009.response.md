The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is the user input with whitespace stripped.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, and `row` is the user input with whitespace stripped.**
