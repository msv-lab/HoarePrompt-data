The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string and `i` is 0, the operation results in `nRow` still being an empty string (concatenating an empty string with 0 results in '0'). Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings (9 original strings and the previous value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '0', `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
