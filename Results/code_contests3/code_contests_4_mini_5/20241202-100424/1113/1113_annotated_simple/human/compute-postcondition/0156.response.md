The string `i` is appended to the string `nRow`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. The list `res` remains unchanged, and `row` also does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include the character `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 transformed strings, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to include the character `i`**
