`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the first element in `row`, which is not equal to '9'. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `nRow`, so it is updated with the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the first element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string or list with whitespace stripped, `i` is the first element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i`.**
