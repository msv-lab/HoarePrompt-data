According to the code, the `for` loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, the `row` string must contain at least one character. The current state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string, which suggests that `row` also might not have any characters. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `row` needs to be a non-empty string. Given that `i` is currently set to 9, it indicates the loop is set to start from the 9th character of `row`, which would not be valid if `row` has fewer than 10 characters.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `row` should be a string with at least one character. Specifically, `row` can be adjusted to any non-empty string, and `i` will represent the index of the first character of `row`, which should be reset to 0 for proper iteration.

State: **`res` contains 10 strings (9 original strings and the final value of `nRow`), `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '', `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
