The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to `nRow`. However, there is no information provided about the initial state of `nRow`, and it is also not mentioned in the initial state. The other variables `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state focuses on the action of appending to `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the third character in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.**
