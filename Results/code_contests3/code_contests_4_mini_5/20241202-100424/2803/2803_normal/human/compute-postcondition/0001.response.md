To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet.

1. The code checks the value of `k`.
2. If `k - 1` is not zero (meaning `k` is greater than 1), it calculates `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`.
3. If `k` is equal to 1, it simply returns `n`.

Now, since `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), we consider both scenarios:

- For `k` = 1, the output will directly be `n`.
- For `k` > 1, we need to compute `len(bin(n)[2:])`, which gives the number of bits needed to represent `n` in binary, and then calculate `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`.

Given that the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we will express the output state based on the conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is either 1 (output is `n`) or greater than 1 (output is `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`)**
