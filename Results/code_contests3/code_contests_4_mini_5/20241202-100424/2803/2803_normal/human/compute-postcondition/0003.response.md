Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from standard input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It returns `n` if `k` is 1; otherwise, it calculates and returns `2` raised to the power of the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus 1. The function does not handle any potential edge cases or errors related to input. **
