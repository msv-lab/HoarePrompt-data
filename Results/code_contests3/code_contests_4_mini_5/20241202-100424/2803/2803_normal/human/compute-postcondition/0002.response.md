The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is stated that `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The exact output of the function is not provided, but it is implied that the function will return a result based on the values of `n` and `k`, which are subject to the specified constraints. 

Since the function does not take parameters directly, it may rely on the values of `n` and `k` being set in some other way prior to the function's execution. 

Based on the information given, we cannot specify the exact functionality without knowing the output details tied to `n` and `k`. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but operates on integers n and k, constrained by 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
