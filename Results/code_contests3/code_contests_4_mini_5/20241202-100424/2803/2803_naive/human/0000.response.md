To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and functionality of the code.

Here's a breakdown of the program:

```python
(n, k) = map(int, raw_input().split())
print(2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1 if k - 1 else n)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to compute the largest xor-sum possible by selecting up to `k` candies from `1` to `n`.
   - The maximum xor-sum for any set of numbers is approached by taking the highest powers of `2` that can be formed by the numbers in the range.

2. **Key Logic in the Code**:
   - `len(bin(n)[2:])` gives the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. This means it is finding how many bits are necessary to represent the largest number `n`.
   - `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` calculates the maximum xor-sum possible using the numbers from `1` to `n` if `k > 1`.
   - The condition `if k - 1` checks if at least one candy can be selected (i.e., `k >= 1`). If `k` is `1`, then it simply returns `n`, the tastiness of the only selected candy.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - If `k = 1`, the program returns `n`, which is correct because you can only select one candy, and that's the best option.
   - However, if `k` is greater than `1`, we need to ensure that the calculation of `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1` indeed represents the largest xor-sum that can be formed with up to `k` candies.
   - The maximum xor-sum that can be achieved from the numbers `1` to `n` is indeed `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, as it represents the scenario where you are using all bits available in the range up to `n`.

### Test Cases:
- For input `(4, 3)`, the output is `7` which is correct.
- For input `(6, 6)`, the output is also `7`, which is correct.

### Edge Cases:
- Let's test with additional edge cases:
  - Input `(1, 1)`: The output should be `1` (which it is).
  - Input `(2, 1)`: The output should be `2` (which it is).
  - Input `(10, 5)`: The output should be `15` (which it is).
  - Input `(15, 10)`: The output should be `15` (which it is).

From the analysis and testing, it appears that the program functions correctly under the given constraints and for the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly computes the largest possible xor-sum for the given constraints based on the problem description.
