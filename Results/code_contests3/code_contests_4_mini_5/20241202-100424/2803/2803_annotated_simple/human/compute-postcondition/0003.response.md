Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It calculates and prints `n` if `k` is equal to 1. If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates `2 ** len(bin(n)[2:]) - 1`, which is one less than the power of two corresponding to the number of bits in `n`, and prints that value. The function does not return any value. **
