The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). Since no specific output information is provided in the prompt, we cannot determine the return values based on the given context. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and its return value is currently undefined based on the provided information.**
