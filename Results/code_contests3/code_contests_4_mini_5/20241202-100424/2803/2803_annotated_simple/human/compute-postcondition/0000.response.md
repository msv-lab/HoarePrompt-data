The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, which is split into two integers. The code does not alter any existing values of `n` or `k` but assigns them new values based on the input. Since the input is not specified, `n` and `k` can still hold any integer values satisfying the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18 after the execution.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers assigned from input such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18**.
