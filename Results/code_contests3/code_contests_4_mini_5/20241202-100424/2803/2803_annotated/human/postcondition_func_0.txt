The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than 1, it calculates and returns `2` raised to the power of the number of bits in `n` minus 1. If `k` is equal to 1, it simply returns `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and executes based on input values.
