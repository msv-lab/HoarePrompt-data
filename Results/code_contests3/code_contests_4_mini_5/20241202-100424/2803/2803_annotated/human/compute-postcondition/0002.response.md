The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The function will return a value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. 

Since the specifics of the output are not provided, we can only conclude that the function must handle the integers `n` and `k` within the specified bounds. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return a result based on the integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on the integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
