Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the smallest index `k` such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first `k` doors. 

Hereâ€™s an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
4
0 0 1 1
```

In this case:
- `0 0` indicates two doors in the left exit, and `1 1` indicates two doors in the right exit.
- The correct output should be `3` because after opening the first three doors (0, 0, 1), all doors in the right exit are open, allowing Mr. Black to exit.

However, analyzing the program:
- The loop iterates in reverse and checks for the first change between `0` and `1`. 
- It does not account for the fact that Mr. Black needs to open all doors in at least one exit to be able to exit.

For the input `4 0 0 1 1`, the program would incorrectly output `1` because it looks for the first index where the door type changes, which does not fulfill the requirement of verifying whether all doors in either exit are open.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements for at least one potential case, leading to an incorrect implementation.
