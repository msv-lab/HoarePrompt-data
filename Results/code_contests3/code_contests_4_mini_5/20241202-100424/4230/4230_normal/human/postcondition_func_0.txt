The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of doors followed by a sequence of `n` integers (0s and 1s) that indicate the door openings. It determines the last index where the sequence of doors changes from one exit type to another (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). If there is no change in the sequence, it returns 0. The function then prints this index.
