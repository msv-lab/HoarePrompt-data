The variable `n` is assigned the values from the input, which is a sequence of integers that represent the number of doors. The input consists of the first integer (number of doors) followed by a sequence of integers (0s and 1s) that describe the state of each door. The specific values from the input are not provided, but `n` is expected to hold these values after execution. The output state relates to the structure of `n` after the input is processed.

Output State: **`n` is a sequence of integers representing the number of doors and their states (0s and 1s)**
