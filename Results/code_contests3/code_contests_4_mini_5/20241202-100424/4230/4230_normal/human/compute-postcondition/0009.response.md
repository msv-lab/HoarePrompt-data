According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate from `n - 2` down to `0`. The variable `i` starts from `n - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2` (before the loop executes) and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n - 3`. 

Given that `n` is at least 2, `i` can take on the value of `n - 3` only if `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3 and `i` is `n - 3`.**
