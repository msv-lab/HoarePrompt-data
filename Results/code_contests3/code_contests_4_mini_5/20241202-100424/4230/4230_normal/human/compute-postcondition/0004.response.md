According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to `n - 2`.

To allow the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2, and we need to set `i` to `n - 2` before the first execution. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`**
