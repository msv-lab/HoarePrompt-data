`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we can express `ans` as `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. Since `n` is at least 2, `ans` will be at least 0. The states of the other variables, `c`, and the condition regarding the loop execution are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is at least 0, and `i` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 3`**
