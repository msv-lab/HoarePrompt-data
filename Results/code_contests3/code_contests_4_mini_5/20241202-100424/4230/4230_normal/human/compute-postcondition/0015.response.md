The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is at least -1, `i` is at least -2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
