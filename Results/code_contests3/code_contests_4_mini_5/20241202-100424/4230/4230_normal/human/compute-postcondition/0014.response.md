The variable `i` is assigned the value `n - 4`. Given that `n` is at least 2, `i` will be at least -2. The code updates `ans` to be `i + 1`, which will be at least -1. Thus, after execution, the value of `ans` will be `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is at least -1, and `i` is at least -2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, `ans` is at least -1, `i` is at least -2**
