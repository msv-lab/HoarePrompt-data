In the given code snippet, `c` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The `raw_input()` function takes input from the user as a string, and `split()` divides the string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Each substring is then converted to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. 

The initial state mentions that `n` is the first element of the original sequence of integers representing the number of doors and their states, but does not provide specific values for the input. Therefore, `c` will hold a collection of integers derived from the user's input, but the specific values of `c` are unknown.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `c` is now a collection of integers derived from user input, and the value of `n` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the original sequence of integers representing the number of doors and their states; `c` is a collection of integers from user input**.
