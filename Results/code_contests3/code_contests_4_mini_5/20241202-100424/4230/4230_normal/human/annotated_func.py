#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected that the first line of input is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of doors, followed by a line of n integers (each either 0 or 1) indicating the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors, where 0 represents a door in the left exit and 1 represents a door in the right exit.
def func():
    n = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = n[0]
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
            ans = i + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a collection of integers from user input, and `ans` is either the last index where `c[i]` is different from `c[i + 1]` or 0 if no such index exists.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of doors followed by a sequence of `n` integers (0s and 1s) that indicate the door openings. It determines the last index where the sequence of doors changes from one exit type to another (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). If there is no change in the sequence, it returns 0. The function then prints this index.
