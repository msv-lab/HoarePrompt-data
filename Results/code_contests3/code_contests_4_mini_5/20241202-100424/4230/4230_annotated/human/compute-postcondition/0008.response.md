Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object of integers converted from input, `ans` is set to `n - 1` if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i + 1]`, the program continues without any change to `ans`.***
