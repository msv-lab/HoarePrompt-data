The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 200,000\)) and a list of `n` integers, each either 0 or 1, representing the state of a sequence of doors. It processes this sequence to find the index of the last element in the list that differs from the next element. If all elements are the same, the function sets `ans` to 0, which indicates no differing elements were found. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`. 

However, the function does not return any values; it only prints the result. Additionally, the input is taken directly from standard input, which may limit its usability in a broader context where function parameters are preferred.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0s and 1s), and prints the index of the last element that differs from its next element, or 0 if all elements are the same. **
