According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The for loop iterates from `n - 2` to `0` (inclusive), which means `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is `2`, the loop will execute with `i` being `0` on the first iteration. 

So, for the loop to be executed the first time, `n` must be at least `2`, and on the first iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object of integers converted from input, `ans` is 0, `i` is n - 2**
