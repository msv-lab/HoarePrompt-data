The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the calculation results in `ans` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object of integers converted from input, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is a map object of integers converted from input, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0**
