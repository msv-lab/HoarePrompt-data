The variable `c` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it will contain a map object that converts each element of the input list (from `raw_input()`, which accepts space-separated integers) into integers. However, the original value of `n` is not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` remains as the first integer from the input list, while `c` becomes a map object of integers.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input list of n integers; `c` is a map object of integers converted from input.**
