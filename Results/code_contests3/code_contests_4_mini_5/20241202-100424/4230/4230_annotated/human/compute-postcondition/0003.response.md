The initialization of `ans` sets its value to 0. The other variables, `n` and `c`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the input list of n integers, `c` is a map object of integers converted from input, `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input list of n integers, `c` is a map object of integers converted from input, `ans` is 0**
