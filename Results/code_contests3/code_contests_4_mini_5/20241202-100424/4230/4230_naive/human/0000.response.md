To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Mr. Black opens doors in a sequence, where:
   - `0` represents a door in the left exit.
   - `1` represents a door in the right exit.
2. Mr. Black can exit if all doors in at least one exit are open.
3. We need to find the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, Mr. Black can exit.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is as follows:
```python
n = map(int, raw_input().split())
n = n[0]
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
ans = 0
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
        ans = i + 1
        break
print(ans)
```

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0`, checking if the current door type is different from the next door (`c[i] != c[i + 1]`). This does not properly determine when all doors of one type have been opened. The exit condition is based on the presence of at least one door from each exit type being opened.
  
2. **No Check for All Doors**: The program does not check if all doors of either exit have been opened. It only checks pairs of adjacent doors, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```
In this scenario:
- After opening the first door (0), the left exit is not fully open.
- After opening the first two doors (0, 1), neither exit is fully open.
- After opening three doors (0, 1, 0), the left exit is still not fully open (only one door).
- After four doors (0, 1, 0, 1), neither exit is fully open.
- After five doors (0, 1, 0, 1, 0), all doors are opened, but we were not able to determine the smallest `k` correctly.

The program will return `3`, which is incorrect because Mr. Black can only exit after all doors are opened.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the smallest index `k` such that Mr. Black can exit, as it fails to check if all doors in at least one exit are open. 

Correctness: **False**.
