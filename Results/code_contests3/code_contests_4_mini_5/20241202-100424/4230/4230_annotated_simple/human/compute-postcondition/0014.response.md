`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is -1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `ans` is 0; `i` is -1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `ans` is 0; `i` is -1**
