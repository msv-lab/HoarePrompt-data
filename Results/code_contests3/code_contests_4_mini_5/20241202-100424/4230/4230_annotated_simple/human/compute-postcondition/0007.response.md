The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
