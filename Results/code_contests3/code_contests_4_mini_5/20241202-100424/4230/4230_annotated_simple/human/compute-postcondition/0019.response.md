The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraint that there is an integer `n` such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 200000`, and a sequence of opened doors represented as a list of `n` integers, where each integer is either `0` (indicating a left exit) or `1` (indicating a right exit). 

Based on the output conditions:

- Case_1: If the list of opened doors contains only 0s, the function returns "All left exits".
- Case_2: If the list of opened doors contains only 1s, the function returns "All right exits".
- Case_3: If the list of opened doors contains both 0s and 1s, the function returns "Mixed exits".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to evaluate the sequence of opened doors and return a string indicating whether all exits are to the left, all exits are to the right, or if there are mixed exits. 

Functionality: **The function evaluates a sequence of opened doors and returns "All left exits" if all are 0s, "All right exits" if all are 1s, or "Mixed exits" if there is a combination of both.**
