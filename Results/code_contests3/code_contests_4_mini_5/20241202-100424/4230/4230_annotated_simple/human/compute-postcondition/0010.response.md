`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the other variables are also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `ans` is 1; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `ans` is 1; `i` is 0**
