`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the value of `ans` becomes 0 + 1 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i + 1]**.
