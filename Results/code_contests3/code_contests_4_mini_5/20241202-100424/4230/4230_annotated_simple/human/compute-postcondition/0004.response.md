According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is defined to iterate from `n - 2` down to `0`, which means it will execute as long as `n - 2` is non-negative. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 200000\), the minimum value of `n` is 2, which makes `n - 2` equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop will set `i` to `0` during its last execution. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 2**
