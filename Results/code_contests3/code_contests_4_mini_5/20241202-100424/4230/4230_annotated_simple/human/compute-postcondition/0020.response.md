The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, representing the number of doors, and a sequence of integers `c`, where each integer is either 0 (indicating a left exit) or 1 (indicating a right exit). The function evaluates the sequence of opened doors from the second last position to the first, checking if the current door differs from the next one. If it finds such a difference, it records the index of the door (plus one) in the variable `ans`. If all doors are the same (either all 0s or all 1s), `ans` will remain 0. 

However, the annotations suggest that the function should return specific strings like "All left exits", "All right exits", or "Mixed exits", which is not implemented in the code. Instead, the function only prints the index or 0, and it does not provide the mentioned output strings. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `c` (where each integer is either 0 or 1), and it prints the index of the last door where the value differs from the next one, or 0 if all doors are the same. It does not return specific exit status strings as suggested by the annotations. **
