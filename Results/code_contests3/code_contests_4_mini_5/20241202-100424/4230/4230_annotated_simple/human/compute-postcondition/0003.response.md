`ans` is assigned the value `0`, and no other variables are affected by this operation. The previous values of `n` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `c` is a map object containing integers from the input; `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `c` is a map object containing integers from the input; `ans` is 0**
