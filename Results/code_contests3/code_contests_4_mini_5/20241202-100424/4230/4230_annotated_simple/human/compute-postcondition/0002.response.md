The code assigns the value of the input to `c`, where `raw_input()` takes input as a string and `split()` separates it into individual components. The `map(int, ...)` converts these components into integers. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `c` is a map object containing integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `c` is a map object containing integers from the input**
