According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate from `n - 2` down to `0`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased by 1. However, since `i` is already at its minimum bound (`0`), the loop will not execute again.

So, for the loop to execute once more, the value of `i` must be adjusted to `-1`, and `n` can remain the same since it will still satisfy the condition of being within the defined bounds. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `ans` is set to 1; `i` is -1 for the loop to execute one more time.**
