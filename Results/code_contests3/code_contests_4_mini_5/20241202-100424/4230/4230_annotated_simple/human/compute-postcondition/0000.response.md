The value of `n` is assigned using `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and then applies the `map` function to create an iterable of integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers (0s and 1s). However, the actual values of `n` and the list of doors are not provided in the input, so the specific integers cannot be determined. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of n integers (0 or 1) based on the input provided.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) based on the input provided.**
