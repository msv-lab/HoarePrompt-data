To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic and verify if it handles all potential edge cases described in the problem statement.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Luba has `n` days and it takes `t` seconds to read the book.
2. Each day, Luba has a certain amount of time `a[i]` dedicated to work, meaning the remaining time for reading is `86400 - a[i]` seconds.
3. The task is to find the minimum day `d` such that the total reading time accumulated over the days is at least `t` seconds.

### Analyzing the Program:
The program reads input values and initializes `i` to 0, then enters a while loop that continues until `t` is reduced to zero or below. Inside the loop:
- It subtracts the available reading time for the current day from `t`.
- It increments the day counter `i`.

Finally, it prints `i`, which represents the number of days it took to read the book.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Exact Reading Time**: If `t` is exactly equal to the sum of all available reading time over the days, the program should return the last day (i.e., `n`).
2. **No Work Time**: If all days have `a[i] = 0`, Luba can read the entire day. If `t` is less than or equal to `86400`, she should finish reading on the first day.
3. **Insufficient Time**: If the sum of available reading time over `n` days is less than `t`, the program should ideally handle this case, but the problem guarantees that the answer does not exceed `n`, which implies it will always be possible to finish reading.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Case where `t` is less than the time available in the first day**:
  ```
  Input:
  1 50000
  0
  Output:
  1
  ```
  Here, Luba can finish reading on the first day since she has 86400 seconds available.

- **Case with maximum work time**:
  ```
  Input:
  2 86400
  86400 86400
  Output:
  1
  ```
  In this case, Luba finishes reading on the first day since she has no time to read on the second day.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the minimum number of days required for Luba to finish reading the book based on the conditions described. It handles various scenarios and adheres to the problem constraints.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
Correctness: **True**
