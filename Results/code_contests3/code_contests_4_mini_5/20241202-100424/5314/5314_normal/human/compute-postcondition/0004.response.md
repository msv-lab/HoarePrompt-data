To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the initial state of the variables.

1. `t` is decremented by the value `86400 - int(a[i])`. 
2. The variable `a` is a list of strings containing input values, and `i` is currently 0, which means we will be using the first element of the list `a`.
3. The operation will convert the first element of `a` (which is a string) into an integer using `int(a[i])`.
4. The value of `86400` is a constant, and the operation will calculate `86400 - int(a[0])`.
5. The new value of `t` will be `t` minus the calculated value.

Since we don't have specific values for `n`, `t`, or `a`, we express the output based on the general state of the input values.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `t` after the operation, while `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[0]))`; `a` is a list of strings containing the input values; `i` is 0**
