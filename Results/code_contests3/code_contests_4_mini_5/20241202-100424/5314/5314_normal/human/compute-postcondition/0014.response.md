The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it operates using the following constraints: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400. 

The output behavior based on these constraints is not provided in detail. Consequently, it cannot be determined how the function processes these inputs or what it returns. Without additional information about the output based on the input parameters, a definitive functionality description cannot be formulated.

Functionality: **The function does not accept explicit parameters but operates with constraints on `n`, `t`, and a list `a`. The specific output is not defined based on these constraints.**
