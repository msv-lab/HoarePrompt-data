The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[1])`, `a` is a list of strings containing the input values, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is greater than `86400 - int(a[1])`, `a` is a list of strings containing the input values, `i` is 3**
