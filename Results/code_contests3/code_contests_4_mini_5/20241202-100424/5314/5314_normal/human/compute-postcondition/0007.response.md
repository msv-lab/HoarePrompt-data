The line `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` updates the value of `t` by subtracting `86400 - int(a[i])` from it. The value of `a[i]` is taken from the list `a`, where `i` is currently 1. The specific value of `a[i]` is not provided in the initial state, but we know that `t` must have been greater than `86400 - int(a[1])` for this operation to have been valid.

Since `t` is updated, the output state will reflect the new value of `t`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`; `a` is a list of strings containing the input values; `i` is 1**
