The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`; `a` is a list of strings containing the input values; `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is updated to `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`; `a` is a list of strings containing the input values; `i` is 2**
