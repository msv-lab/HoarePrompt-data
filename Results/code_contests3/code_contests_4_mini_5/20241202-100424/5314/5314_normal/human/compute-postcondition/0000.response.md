The values of `n` and `t` are assigned from the input, which is processed to convert the input string into a list of integers using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. Therefore, `n` will take an integer value within the range of 1 to 100, and `t` will take an integer value within the range of 1 to 10^6. The list `a` remains unaffected by this line of code, as it does not directly alter anything related to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400.**
