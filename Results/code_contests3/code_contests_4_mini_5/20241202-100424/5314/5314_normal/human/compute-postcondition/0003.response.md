According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^6, meaning that it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Since `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0, no adjustments are needed for `t`. Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings containing the input values; `i` is 0**
