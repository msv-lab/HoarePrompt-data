The code takes an input string from the user and splits it into a list of strings, which is then assigned to the variable `a`. The previous state of `n`, `t`, and the integer values in the list `a` are not affected directly by this line of code. The variable `a` now contains strings representing integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings containing the input values.**
