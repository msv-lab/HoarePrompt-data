Functionality: ** The function reads two integers, `n` and `t`, and a list of `n` integers representing values `a[i]`. It then calculates how many elements from the list can be processed before the value of `t` becomes non-positive by repeatedly subtracting `86400 - a[i]` from `t`. The function returns the count of processed elements (stored in `i`), which is printed as output. If `t` is reduced to zero or below before processing all elements in `a`, the function will stop processing further elements and return the count of those processed so far. The function does not handle cases where `t` is initially too small to allow for any processing, nor does it specify behavior for cases where `a` contains invalid values.**
