The code assigns values to `n` and `t` by taking input from the user, which is expected to provide two integers. The initial values of `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified ranges, so after execution, `n` and `t` will hold the values provided by the user. The list `a` is not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of n integers, `n` is the first input integer, and `t` is the second input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer.**
