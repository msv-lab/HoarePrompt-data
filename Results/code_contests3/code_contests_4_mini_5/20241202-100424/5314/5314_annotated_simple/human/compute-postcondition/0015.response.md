The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `t`, where `n` represents the number of days and `t` represents the total time available in seconds. It also accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer represents the time Luba has to spend on work during each day. The function iteratively subtracts the remaining time of each day (calculated as `86400 - a[i]`) from `t` until `t` is no longer positive or all days have been processed. Finally, it prints the count of days processed before `t` became non-positive. 

The potential edge case is that if `t` is initially less than or equal to `0`, no iterations will occur, and `i` will remain `0`, leading to the output of `0`. Also, the function does not have a return statement; it only prints the result. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `t`, and a list of `n` integers representing work times. It calculates how many days Luba can work before the total available time `t` becomes non-positive and prints that count. If `t` is initially non-positive, it will print `0`. **
