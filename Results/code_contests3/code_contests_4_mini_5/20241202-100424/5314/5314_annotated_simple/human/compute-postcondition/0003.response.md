According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the second input integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer (where `t` > 0), `a` is now a list of strings split from the raw input, `i` is 0**
