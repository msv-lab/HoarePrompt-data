The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. Since `i` is 1, this means we are using the second element of the list `a`, which is `a[1]`. Therefore, the new value of `t` becomes `t - (86400 - int(a[1]))`. 

The initial values of the variables are:
- `a` is a list of `n` integers,
- `n` is the first input integer,
- `t` is the second input integer after subtracting `(86400 - int(a[0]))`,
- `i` is 1.

After executing the code, `t` is updated based on the value of `a[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is updated, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is updated, `i` is 1**
