The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer after subtracting (86400 - int(a[0])), `i` is 1**
