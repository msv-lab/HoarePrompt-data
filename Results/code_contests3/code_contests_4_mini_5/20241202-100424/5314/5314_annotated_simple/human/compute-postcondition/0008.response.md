The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables, `a`, `n`, and `t`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is updated, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is updated, `i` is 2**
