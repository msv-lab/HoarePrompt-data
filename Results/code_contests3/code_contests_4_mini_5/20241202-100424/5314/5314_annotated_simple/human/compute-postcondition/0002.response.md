The variable `i` is initialized to 0, and it does not affect any other variables or values in the current state. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of n integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer; `a` is now a list of strings split from the raw input; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers, `n` is the first input integer, `t` is the second input integer; `a` is now a list of strings split from the raw input; `i` is 0**
