The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of days (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `t` is a positive integer representing the total time available (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6). Additionally, the function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400).

The function does not directly return a value in the provided output description, but based on the context, it is implied that the function likely processes the inputs `n`, `t`, and `a` to produce a result related to Luba's work schedule or time management.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes these inputs to determine a result related to Luba's work schedule, though the specific return value is not detailed in the output.**
