Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the second line of input (`a = raw_input().split()`) as strings and does not convert these to integers. This means that the variable `a` will be a list of strings, which will cause issues when trying to perform arithmetic operations with them later on.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `t > 0`, but it does not account for the case when the number of days (`n`) is exceeded. The program does not have a condition to stop iterating over the list `a` after it has processed all `n` days. As a result, if `t` remains positive after processing all days, it will lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access `a[i]` for `i` equal to `n` or greater.

3. **Output**: The program prints `i` after the loop, which represents the number of days processed. However, the problem specifies that it should print the minimum day when Luba can finish reading the book. If Luba finishes reading on the last day, `i` may be equal to `n`, but there is no check to confirm that Luba has actually finished reading by that day.

4. **Logic Flaw**: The logic used to calculate the time Luba can spend reading is flawed. The program subtracts the working time from a constant maximum of 86400 seconds, but it does not properly accumulate the reading time over multiple days to determine when `t` becomes non-positive.

In summary, the program fails to correctly read input types, does not handle the end of the days correctly, and does not ensure that it outputs the correct day when Luba finishes reading. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
