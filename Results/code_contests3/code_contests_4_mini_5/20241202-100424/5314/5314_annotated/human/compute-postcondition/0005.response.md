The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. After execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer decreased by a value between 0 and 86400; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is between 0 and 86400 (inclusive); `a` is a list of substrings from the input; `i` is 1.
