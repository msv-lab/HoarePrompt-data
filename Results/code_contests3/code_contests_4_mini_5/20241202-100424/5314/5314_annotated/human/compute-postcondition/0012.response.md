Output State: **`t` is decreased by the sum of values `86400 - int(a[j])` for each `j` from 0 to `i-1`, `i` is the number of iterations executed, which is equal to the total elements processed from the list `a` until `t` becomes non-positive, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is between 0 and 86400 (inclusive).**
