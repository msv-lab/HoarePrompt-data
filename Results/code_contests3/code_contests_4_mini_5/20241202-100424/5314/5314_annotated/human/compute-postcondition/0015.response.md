The function `func` accepts two integers, `n` (the number of elements in the list) and `t` (a time value), as well as a list `a` of `n` integers representing time values between 0 and 86400 (the number of seconds in a day). The function iteratively processes the list, decrementing `t` by the value of `86400 - int(a[i])` for each element in the list until `t` becomes non-positive. It counts the number of iterations executed before this condition is met and prints this count.

The edge cases to consider include:
1. If `t` is initially 0 or very small, the function will print 0 immediately since it won't enter the loop.
2. The loop will always process at most `n` elements (up to 100) since `n` is constrained, but if `t` becomes non-positive before reaching the end of the list, it will print the count of elements processed up to that point.
3. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the list `a` might have fewer elements than `n`, assuming valid input is always provided based on the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list of `n` integers, then counts how many iterations it can perform by reducing `t` based on the values in the list until `t` is non-positive, and prints the count of iterations. **
