The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The states of the other variables, `n` and `t`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by the value of `86400 - int(a[i])`; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by the value of `86400 - int(a[i])`; `i` is increased by 1**.
