The code assigns the value of `raw_input().split()` to the variable `a`. The `raw_input` function reads a line of input as a string, and the `split` method splits this string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `ai` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `a` which is now a list of strings resulting from the split operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is between 0 and 86400 (inclusive); `a` is a list of substrings from the input.**
