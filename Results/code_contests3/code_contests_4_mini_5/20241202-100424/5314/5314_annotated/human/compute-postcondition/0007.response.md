The code `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])` modifies the value of `t` by subtracting the difference between 86400 and the integer value of `a[i]`. The value of `t` is decreased, but the previous value of `t` is not specified. The value of `a[i]` is assumed to be a valid integer from the list `a`.

Since `t` must have been greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we can infer that the operation is valid. However, without specific values for `t` or `a[i]`, we can only state the general impact of the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by the value of `86400 - int(a[i])` where `t` was previously greater than 0.**
