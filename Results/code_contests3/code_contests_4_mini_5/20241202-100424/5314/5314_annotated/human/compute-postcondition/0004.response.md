The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. The previous value of `t` is between `1` and `10^6`, and `a[i]` is an integer between `0` and `86400`. Thus, `int(a[i])` will also be between `0` and `86400`. The calculation `86400 - int(a[i])` will yield a value between `86400` and `0`. Consequently, `t` will be reduced by a value that keeps it within the range of valid integers.

The exact new value of `t` after this calculation depends on the specific value of `a[i]`, which is unknown. Therefore, we can only describe the effect in terms of its potential range. `t` will still remain a valid integer after the operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer decreased by a value between 0 and 86400; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` is between 0 and 86400 (inclusive); `a` is a list of substrings from the input; `i` is 0.**
