To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and see if it meets the requirements for all potential input cases.

### Problem description summary:
Luba has `n` days and needs `t` seconds to read a book. Each day, she has `a[i]` seconds of work, so the free time available for reading on day `i` is `86400 - a[i]` seconds. We need to determine the minimum day when Luba can finish reading the book.

### Program analysis:
```python
(n, t) = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
a = raw_input().split()
i = 0
while t > 0:
    t -= 86400 - int(a[i])
    i += 1
print(i)
```
1. **Input Handling**: The first line reads `n` and `t`, and the second line reads the list of work times `a`. The program assumes `a` is a list of strings and does not convert them to integers immediately.
   
2. **Loop Logic**: The loop continues until `t` is less than or equal to 0. Inside the loop, it calculates the free time for reading as `86400 - int(a[i])` and subtracts this from `t`. The loop increments `i` after each iteration.

3. **Output**: The program prints `i`, which represents the number of days it took to finish reading the book.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Off-by-One Error**: The output `i` is incremented after the last valid day. Thus, it will print the day after Luba has finished reading, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should print `i` only after checking if `t` has become zero or negative.

2. **Input Handling**: The time spent on work is read as strings and not converted to integers until later. If `a` is not correctly converted to integers before calculations, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input case:
```
1 86400
0
```
Expected output: `1` (Luba finishes reading on the first day).
However, the program would calculate:
- Free time = `86400 - 0 = 86400`
- After one iteration, `t` becomes `86400 - 86400 = 0`
- `i` is incremented to `1` and printed.

If the loop condition checks correctly and `t` is equal to 0 after the calculation, it will print `1`, which is correct. But due to the logic that could cause an increment before checking the end condition, it might miscount in other scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the off-by-one error correctly, it may print the wrong day when Luba finishes reading. 

Correctness: **False**.
