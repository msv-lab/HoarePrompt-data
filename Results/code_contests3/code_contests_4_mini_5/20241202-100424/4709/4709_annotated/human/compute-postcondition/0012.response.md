Postcondition: ***`a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid, `l` is a list of three distinct lowercase letters, `A` is the first letter of `l`, `B` is the second letter of `l`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `a`. If the characters at positions C[0] and C[4] are equal, and the characters at positions C[1] and C[3] are equal, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
