Postcondition: ***`a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid, `l` is a list of three distinct lowercase letters, `A` is the first letter of `l`, `B` is the second letter of `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 1`, `C` is a list of characters of the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
