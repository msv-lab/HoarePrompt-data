`l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid consisting of three lowercase English letters, `l` will be a list containing those three letters as separate elements. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid consisting of three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of those three letters.

Output State: **`a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid consisting of three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of those three letters.**
