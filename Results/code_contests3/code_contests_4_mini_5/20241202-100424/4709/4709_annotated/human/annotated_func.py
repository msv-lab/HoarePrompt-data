#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines, each containing three lowercase English letters, forming a 3x3 grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid consisting of three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of those three letters; `A` is the first letter of `l`, `B` is the second letter of `l`; if the integer representation of `A` is equal to the integer representation of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string input from the first line of a 3x3 grid, `l` is a list of three distinct lowercase letters, `A` is the first letter of `l`, `B` is the second letter of `l`, `i` ranges from `int(A)` to `int(B) - 1`, `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i` for each iteration, and `ans` is the count of occurrences where `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]` for all values of `i` in that range.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters provided as input. It checks if the integer representations of the first two letters are equal and initializes a counter variable, `ans`. It then iterates over the range defined by these integer values, converting each integer to a string and checking specific character positions for equality. The final value of `ans`, representing the count of matches based on these criteria, is printed. The function does not return any values.
