#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines, each containing three lowercase English letters, forming a 3Ã—3 grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string input consisting of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the three letters as separate elements, `A` is the first element of the list `l`, `B` is the second element of the list `l`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `l` contains three letters as separate elements, `A` is the first letter, `B` is the second letter, `ans` is the count of valid integers in the range from `int(A)` to `int(B) - 1`, plus 1 if the loop executed, otherwise 1 if `A` is equal to `B`.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads three lines of input, each containing three lowercase English letters. It extracts the first two lines as integers A and B, then counts how many integers in the range from A to B (exclusive) have a palindromic representation when converted to a string. If A is equal to B, it initializes the count to 1. Finally, it prints the count of such integers. However, the input is expected to be numerical representations rather than letters, which may lead to errors if the input does not conform to this expectation.
