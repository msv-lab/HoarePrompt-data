Postcondition: ***`l` contains three letters as separate elements. If the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C` and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is incremented by 1, where `A` is the first letter, `B` is the second letter, `i` is `int(A)`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`.***
