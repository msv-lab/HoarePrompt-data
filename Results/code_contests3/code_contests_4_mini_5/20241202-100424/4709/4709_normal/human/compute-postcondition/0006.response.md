The variable `ans` is assigned the value 1. Prior to this assignment, `ans` was 0. The values of the other variables, including `a`, `l`, `A`, and `B`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string input consisting of three lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the three letters as separate elements, `A` is the first element of the list `l`, which is `l[0]`, `B` is the second element of the list `l`, which is `l[1]`, `ans` is 1, and the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.
