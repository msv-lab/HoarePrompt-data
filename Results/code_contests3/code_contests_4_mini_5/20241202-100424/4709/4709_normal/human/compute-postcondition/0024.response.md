Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads three lines of input, each containing three lowercase English letters. It extracts the first two lines as integers A and B, then counts how many integers in the range from A to B (exclusive) have a palindromic representation when converted to a string. If A is equal to B, it initializes the count to 1. Finally, it prints the count of such integers. However, the input is expected to be numerical representations rather than letters, which may lead to errors if the input does not conform to this expectation. **
