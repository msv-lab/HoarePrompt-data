The variable `i` is assigned the value `int(A) + 1`, and its value is then used in the expression `str(i)`, which converts `i` to a string. The result is then converted into a list of its characters, which is assigned to `C`. This means `C` will contain the individual characters of the string representation of `i`. The state of the other variables (`l` and `B`) is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` contains three letters as separate elements; `i` is `int(A) + 1`; `C` is a list of characters of `str(i)`.

Output State: **`l` contains three letters as separate elements; `i` is `int(A) + 1`; `C` is a list of characters of `str(i)`**.
