Postcondition: ***`l` contains three letters as separate elements, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then the variable `ans` is increased by 1. If the conditions are not met, `ans` remains unchanged.***
