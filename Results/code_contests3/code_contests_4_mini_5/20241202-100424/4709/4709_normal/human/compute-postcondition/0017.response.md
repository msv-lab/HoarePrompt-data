According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(B)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `int(A) + 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `int(B)`, so `A` must be less than `B - 1` (i.e., `int(A) + 1` must be less than `int(B)`).

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be `int(A) + 2`, and `i` must still be less than `int(B)`.

State: **`l` contains three letters as separate elements; `i` is `int(A) + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `int(A) + 2` must be less than `int(B)`**.
