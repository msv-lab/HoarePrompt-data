`A` is assigned the value of `l[0]`, which is the first element of the list `l`. Since `l` contains the string `a` as a single element, `A` will now hold the value of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string input consisting of exactly three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the string `a` as a single element; `A` is the string `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a string input consisting of exactly three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the string `a` as a single element; `A` is the string `a`**
