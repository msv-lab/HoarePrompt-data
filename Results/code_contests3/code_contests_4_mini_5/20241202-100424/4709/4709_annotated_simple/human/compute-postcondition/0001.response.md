The value of `l` is assigned the result of `a.split()`. Since `a` is a string consisting of exactly three lowercase English letters with no spaces, the `split()` method will return a list containing the entire string as a single element. Therefore, `l` will be a list with one element, which is the string `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a string input consisting of exactly three lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the string `a` as a single element.**
