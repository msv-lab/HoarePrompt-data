Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input, which is incorrect in the context of Python 3 (it should be `input()`). Additionally, it attempts to split the input string based on whitespace using `split()`, but the input format specified in the problem description consists of three lines, each containing exactly three characters without spaces. Thus, the way the input is processed is fundamentally flawed.

2. **Variable Usage**: The variables `A` and `B` are intended to represent the three rows of input, but they are incorrectly used as strings and then converted to integers. This conversion does not make sense in the context of the problem, which deals with strings of characters, not integers.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The condition `if (int(A) == int(B))` and the subsequent for loop do not relate to constructing the required diagonal string from the 3x3 grid. Instead, the logic appears to be attempting to compare integer values and count occurrences based on conditions that do not match the problem's requirement of concatenating diagonal letters.

4. **Output**: The program prints `ans`, which is a count of certain conditions met during the loop, rather than the required concatenated string of diagonal letters.

In conclusion, the program fails to implement the required functionality to extract and print the diagonal letters from the 3x3 grid as specified in the problem description, making it incorrect.
