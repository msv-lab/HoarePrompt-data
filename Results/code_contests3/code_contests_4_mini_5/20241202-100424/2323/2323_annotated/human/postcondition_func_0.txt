The function accepts a positive integer `a` (given as a string) and an integer `b` (the divisor) and calculates the minimum value of `a % b` after performing "good shifts" on `a`. A good shift is performed by moving the last digit of `a` to the front, but if the last digit is `0`, it does not affect the value of `a`. The function prints the minimum result of `a % b` after all shifts, but it does not handle cases where the input value of `a` might be zero, as it assumes `a` is always a positive integer.
