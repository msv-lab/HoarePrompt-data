The value of `h` is assigned the last digit of `a` using the modulus operator `%`. Since the last digit of `a` is given as 0, `h` will also be 0. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is calculated as a % b, `i` is 0, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is calculated as a % b, `i` is 0, `h` is 0**.
