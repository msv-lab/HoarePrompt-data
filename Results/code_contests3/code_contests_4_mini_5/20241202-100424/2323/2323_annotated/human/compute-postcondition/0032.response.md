The value of `a` is modified by performing integer division by 10, which effectively removes the last digit of `a`. The previous values of the affected variables are `c` (the number of digits in `a`), `i` (which is incremented by 1 but is not directly affected by this code), and `h` (the last digit of `a` obtained by `a % 10`). The operation does not affect `c`, `i`, or `h` directly, but the value of `a` changes.

Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`; `i` is incremented by 1; `h` is the last digit of the original value of `a`; `a` is now the value of `a` without its last digit.

Output State: **`c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`; `i` is incremented by 1; `h` is the last digit of the original value of `a`; `a` is now the value of `a` without its last digit.**
