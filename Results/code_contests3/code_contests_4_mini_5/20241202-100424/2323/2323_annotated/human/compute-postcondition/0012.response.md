`c` is incremented by 1, and its previous value was 2, so after execution, `c` becomes 3. The values of `a`, `b`, and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is not defined.

Output State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 3, and `copya` is not defined.**
