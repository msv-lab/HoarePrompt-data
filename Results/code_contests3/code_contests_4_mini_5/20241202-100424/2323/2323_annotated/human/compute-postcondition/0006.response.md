`c` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `c` is 0. So after execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is equal to `a // 10**
