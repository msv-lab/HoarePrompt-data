According to the code, the loop can only execute if the variable `copya` evaluates to `True`. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is not defined, which means it cannot evaluate to `True` and thus the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, `copya` needs to be defined and assigned a value that evaluates to `True` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `copya` must be defined and evaluate to True**
