According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero (truthy). Right before the loop, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is an input integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `a` must be non-zero. 

State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time then `a` must be non-zero**
