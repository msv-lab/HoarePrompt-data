According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be non-zero. Therefore, `a` must be at least 10 for `copya` to be greater than zero. If `a` is less than 10, then `copya` would be zero, and the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be adjusted to be at least 10.

State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `a` must be at least 10**.
