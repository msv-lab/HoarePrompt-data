Since `copya` is not defined in the initial state, the statement `copya //= 10` would not have any effect or output any value. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, and `copya` is not defined.**
