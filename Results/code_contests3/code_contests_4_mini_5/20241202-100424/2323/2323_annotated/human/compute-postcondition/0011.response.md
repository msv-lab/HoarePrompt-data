The expression `copya //= 10` modifies the value of `copya` by performing integer division by 10. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `copya`, and it is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the outcome of this operation since `copya` must be defined for the operation to proceed.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Consequently, the output state reflects that `copya` is not defined.

Output State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is not defined.**
