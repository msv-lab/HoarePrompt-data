Postcondition: ***`c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`. If the last digit of `a` is not zero, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the last digit of `a`, and `ans` is updated based on `min(ans, a % b)`. If the last digit of `a` is zero, `a` is updated to a new value calculated as `10`, and `h` remains the last digit of the original value of `a`.***
