Postcondition: ***`c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `c` is updated to the number of digits in the new value of `a`, `i` is set to this new value of `c`, `h` is the last digit of the original value of `a`, `a` is updated to 10, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `a % b`. Otherwise, `c` remains the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `i` is still `c`, and `h` is the last digit of the original `a`, while `a` is also updated to 10.***
