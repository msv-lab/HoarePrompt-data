`c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `copya`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is not defined.

Output State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, and `copya` is not defined**.
