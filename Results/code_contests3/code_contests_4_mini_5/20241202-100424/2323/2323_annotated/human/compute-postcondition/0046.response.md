The function `func` accepts two parameters: a string representing a positive integer and an integer `m`. The string must represent a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `m` must be an integer within the range of 2 to 10^8. The function then evaluates the number of good shifts of the integer that are divisible by `m`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string representing a positive integer and an integer `m`, and return the count of good shifts of that integer that are divisible by `m`.
