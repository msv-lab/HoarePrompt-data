After executing the code `a //= 10`, the value of `a` is divided by 10 using floor division, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The values of `c`, `i`, and `h` are not directly affected by this operation, but `c` would now represent the number of digits in the new value of `a`, and `h` would no longer be the last digit of the new value.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes:

Output State: **`c` is the number of digits in the new value of `a`, `i` is `c`, `h` is the last digit of the original value of `a`**
