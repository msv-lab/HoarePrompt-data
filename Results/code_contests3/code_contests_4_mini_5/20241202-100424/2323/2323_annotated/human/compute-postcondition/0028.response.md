The value of `a` is divided by 10 using floor division, which effectively removes the last digit of `a`. The value of `c` remains unchanged as it represents the number of digits in the original value of `a`, and `i` is already incremented by 1. The variable `h` retains the value of `a % 10`, which was assigned before this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the last digit of the original value of `a`, and `a` is now the value of the original `a` divided by 10.

Output State: **`c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the last digit of the original value of `a`, `a` is now the value of the original `a` divided by 10.**
