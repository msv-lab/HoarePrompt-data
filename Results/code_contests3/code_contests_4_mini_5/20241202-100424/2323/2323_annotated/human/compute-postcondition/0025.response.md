Postcondition: ***`c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, then `h` is equal to `a % 10`, `a` is updated to 10, and the loop will continue as long as `c` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, if `a % 10` is equal to 0, then `h` is 0, and `a` remains unchanged while the other variables retain their initial states.***
