`copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is determined by user input and is an integer. The other variables (`b` and `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and `copya` is assigned the value of `a`.

Output State: **`a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`**
