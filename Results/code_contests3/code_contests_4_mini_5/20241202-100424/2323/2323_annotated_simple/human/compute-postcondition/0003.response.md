`copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer, while variables `b` and `c` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is the same as `a`.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is the same as `a`**
