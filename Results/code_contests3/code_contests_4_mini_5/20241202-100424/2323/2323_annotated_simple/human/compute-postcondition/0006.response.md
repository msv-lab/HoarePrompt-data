The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, and `copya`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is `a // 10**
