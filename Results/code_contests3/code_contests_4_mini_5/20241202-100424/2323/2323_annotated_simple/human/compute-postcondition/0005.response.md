The value of `copya` is updated by performing integer division by 10. Since `copya` is initially the same as `a`, the result of `copya //= 10` will be the value of `a` divided by 10, using integer division. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a // 10**
