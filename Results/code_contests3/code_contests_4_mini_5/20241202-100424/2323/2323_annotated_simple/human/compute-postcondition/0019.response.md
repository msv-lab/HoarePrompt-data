The variable `a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. Here, `10 ** c` calculates 10 raised to the power of `c`, and since `c` is greater than 0, this will result in a positive integer. The value of `h` is a non-zero integer, and `a` is the result of the previous operation `a // 10`. Thus, the new value of `a` will be the sum of `10 ** c * h` and the previous value of `a`.

The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` are not directly impacted by this operation, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` is a non-zero integer, `a` is updated to `10 ** c * h + a`**
