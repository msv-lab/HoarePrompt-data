The value of `copya` is reduced by integer division by 10. Since `copya` must be greater than 0 for another iteration, it will be updated to `copya // 10`. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. The exact value of `copya` after the operation will depend on its previous value, but it will be less than or equal to its original value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10, and `c` remains increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `copya` is updated by integer division by 10, and `c` remains increased by 1.**
