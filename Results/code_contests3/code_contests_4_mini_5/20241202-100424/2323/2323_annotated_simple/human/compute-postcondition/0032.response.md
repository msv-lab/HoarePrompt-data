The statement `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10 and assigns the result back to `a`. However, the initial value of `a` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the effect on `a`. The values of `copya`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the value of `a` is reduced by integer division by 10.**
