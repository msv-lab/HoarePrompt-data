The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by 10. Since `a` is not divisible by 10, the value of `h` will be a non-zero integer, specifically the remainder of `a` when divided by 10. The values of the other variables `copya`, `c`, and `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `h` is a non-zero integer (the remainder of `a` divided by 10).

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `h` is a non-zero integer (the remainder of `a` divided by 10)**
