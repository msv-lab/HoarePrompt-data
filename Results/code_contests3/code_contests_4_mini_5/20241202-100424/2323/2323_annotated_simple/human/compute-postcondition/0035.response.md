According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `c` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `c` must be greater than 2.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 2**
