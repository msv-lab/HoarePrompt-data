`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is a value such that `a % 10 == 0`, the result of `a % 10` will be 0. Other variables (`copya`, `c`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a value such that `a % 10 == 0`, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a value such that `a % 10 == 0`, `h` is 0**
