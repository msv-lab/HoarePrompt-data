The function `func` accepts a parameter `num_str`, which is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. It also accepts an integer parameter `m`, which is constrained such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. 

After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs and returns a value based on certain conditions related to the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `num_str` representing a positive integer and an integer `m` (where 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8) and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
