The value of `copya` is divided by 10 using integer division. Since `a` is a positive integer and must be at least 10 for the loop to execute again, after this operation, `copya` will be reduced to a smaller integer. However, the previous value of `copya` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `copya` is reduced by integer division by 10.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `copya` is reduced by integer division by 10**
