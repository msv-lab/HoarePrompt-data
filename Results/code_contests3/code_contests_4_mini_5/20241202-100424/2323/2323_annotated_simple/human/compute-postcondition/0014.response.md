`ans` is assigned the value of `a % b`, which computes the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`. The values of `copya`, `c`, and the input integers `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`**.
