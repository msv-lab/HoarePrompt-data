According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `c`, which represents the number of digits in the original value of `a`. For the loop to execute at least once, `c` must be greater than 0. 

Since `copya` is initialized to 0 at the start and is not relevant to the execution of the loop, it does not need adjustment. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the loop, and it will iterate up to `c - 1`. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute for the first time, `c` must be at least 1 (indicating that `a` has at least one digit) and `i` should be 0 when the loop starts executing.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is 0**
