According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not zero (i.e., while `copya` is truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is `a // 10`, which means it will be zero if `a` is a single-digit number. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` needs to be greater than zero. This implies that `a` must be at least 10.

To ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `a` must be at least 10.

State: **`a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be at least 10**
