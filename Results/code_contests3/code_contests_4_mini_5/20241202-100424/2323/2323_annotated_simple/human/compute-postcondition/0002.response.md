The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`, which does not depend on the previous values of `a` or `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0**
