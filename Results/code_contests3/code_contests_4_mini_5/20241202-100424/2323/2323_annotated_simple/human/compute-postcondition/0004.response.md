According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as `copya` is truthy. Since `copya` is initialized to the same value as `a`, it will execute as long as `a` is a positive integer (greater than 0). Right before the loop, `copya` is equivalent to `a`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop can execute the first time without needing any adjustments.

State: **`a` is the input integer converted from the string representation of a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is the same as `a`**
