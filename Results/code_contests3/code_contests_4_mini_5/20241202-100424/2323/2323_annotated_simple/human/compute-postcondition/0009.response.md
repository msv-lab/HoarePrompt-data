The value of `c` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `c` is unknown. The values of `a` and `copya` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the input integer, `copya` is reduced by integer division by 10, and `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is the input integer, `copya` is reduced by integer division by 10, and `c` is increased by 1.**
