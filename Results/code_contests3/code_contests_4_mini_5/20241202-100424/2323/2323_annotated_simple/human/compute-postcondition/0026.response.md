According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `c` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute at least once more. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `c` must be greater than 1.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 1**
