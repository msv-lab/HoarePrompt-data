The function accepts two inputs: a positive integer `a` (provided as a string) and an integer `b` (where 2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8). It calculates the minimum value of `a % b` by examining all possible single-digit rotations of `a` (by moving the last digit to the front) and prints this minimum value. If `a` consists of digits that all eventually lead to a zero when rotated, it may not explore all valid configurations, but it will still handle cases where the last digit is zero correctly. The function does not explicitly handle input validation for the string representation's conformity to being a positive integer or for the range of `b`.
