The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `a` with up to 200,000 digits and a positive integer `b` (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a % b` by performing cyclic shifts of `a` while ignoring zero digits at the end, but it does not return any value or handle cases where `a` is less than `b`.
