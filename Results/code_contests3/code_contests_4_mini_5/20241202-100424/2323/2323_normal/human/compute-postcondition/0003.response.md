`copya` is assigned the value of `a`. The value of `a` is an input integer, so `copya` takes on that value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a`.

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a`.**
