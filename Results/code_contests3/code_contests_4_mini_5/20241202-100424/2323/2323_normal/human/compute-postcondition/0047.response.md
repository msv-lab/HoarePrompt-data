The function `func` accepts two inputs: a positive integer `a`, which is read from input and can be a string representation of a number with 2 to 200,000 digits, and a positive integer `b`, which is also read from input and can range from 2 to 10^8. The function calculates the minimum value of `a % b` after attempting to cyclically shift the digits of `a` while ignoring any zero digits at the end.

The process involves determining the number of digits in `a`, and then for each digit, if the last digit is non-zero, it performs a cyclic shift of the digits and calculates `a % b`. The minimum of these values is stored in `ans`, which is printed at the end. 

However, the function does not explicitly handle input validation or scenarios where `a` might be less than `b`. Additionally, there is no return value; it only prints the result without returning it, which may not align with typical expectations for a function.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `a` with up to 200,000 digits and a positive integer `b` (2 ≤ b ≤ 10^8). It calculates and prints the minimum value of `a % b` by performing cyclic shifts of `a` while ignoring zero digits at the end, but it does not return any value or handle cases where `a` is less than `b`. **
