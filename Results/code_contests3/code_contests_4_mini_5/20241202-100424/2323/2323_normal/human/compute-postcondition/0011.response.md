`copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`. The previous value of `copya` is `a // 100`, and since `a` is greater than or equal to 100, `copya` will be at least 1. Therefore, `copya // 10` will be either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `copya`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 100; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is either 0 or 1.**
