The value of `c` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `c` is 1, after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is `a // 100`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is `a // 100`**.
