`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of a % b, `i` is 0, `h` is 0**.
