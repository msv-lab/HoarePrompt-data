The loop counts the number of digits in the integer `a` by continuously dividing `copya` by 10 until `copya` becomes 0. After all iterations, `c` will hold the total number of digits in the original integer `a`, and `copya` will be 0.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is the number of digits in the original value of `a`; `copya` is 0.**
