According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is derived from `a // 100`, and since `a` is greater than or equal to 10, `copya` must be at least 0. However, to ensure the loop can execute again, `copya` must be greater than 0. 

For `copya` to be greater than 0, `a` must be greater than or equal to 100 (since `copya` is the result of `a // 100`). Thus, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 100; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is `a // 100`**
