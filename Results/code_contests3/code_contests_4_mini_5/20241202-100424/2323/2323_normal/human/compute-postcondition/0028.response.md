The value of `a` is divided by 10 using integer division, which effectively removes the last digit of `a`. The value of `h` remains unchanged. The state of the other variables, including `Stepan's integer`, is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer; `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`; `a` is now the result of `a // 10`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer; `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`; `a` is now the result of `a // 10.**
