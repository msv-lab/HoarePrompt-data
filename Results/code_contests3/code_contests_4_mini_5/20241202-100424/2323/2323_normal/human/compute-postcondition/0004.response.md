According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. In Python, a non-zero integer is considered truthy, while zero is falsy. Since `copya` is initialized to the value of `a`, the loop will execute as long as `copya` is not zero.

Given that `copya` is equal to `a`, which is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0). Since `Stepan's integer is a string representation of a positive integer`, we can assume `a` is properly initialized as a positive integer.

Thus, no adjustments are needed for `copya` since it is equal to `a`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, the loop can indeed execute.

State: **Stepan's integer is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a`.**
