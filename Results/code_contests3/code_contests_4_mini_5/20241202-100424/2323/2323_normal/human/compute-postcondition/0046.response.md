The function `func` does not explicitly have parameters in its definition, suggesting it may rely on global variables or context not shown here. However, based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function processes a string representation of a positive integer, referred to as `Stepan's integer`, and a positive integer `m`. 

`Stepan's integer` is a string with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits. The integer `m` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. 

Given the output description is not provided, we will describe the potential behavior based on the input constraints. 

The functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `Stepan's integer` representing a positive integer (2 to 200,000 digits long) and an integer `m` (between 2 and 10^8), and it will likely perform operations based on these inputs, returning a result based on the defined conditions. However, the specific return value is not detailed.**
