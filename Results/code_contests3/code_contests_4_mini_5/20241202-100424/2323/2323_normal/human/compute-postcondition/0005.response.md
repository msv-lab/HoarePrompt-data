The variable `copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`, which performs integer division of `copya` by 10. The previous value of `copya` is `a`, which is a positive integer. The value of `copya` will change to `a // 10`. The states of the other variables `Stepan's integer`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **Stepan's integer is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a // 10`.**
