`c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 100; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 3; `copya` is either 0 or 1.
