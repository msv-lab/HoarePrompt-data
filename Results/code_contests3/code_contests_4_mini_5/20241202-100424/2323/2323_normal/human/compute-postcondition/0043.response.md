Postcondition: ***`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer. If `a % 10` is not equal to 0, `i` is incremented to `k + 1`, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, `a` is updated to the result of `10`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented to `k + 1`, `c` must be greater than `k + 1`, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, and `a` is reduced by a factor of 10, updating `a` to `10`.***
