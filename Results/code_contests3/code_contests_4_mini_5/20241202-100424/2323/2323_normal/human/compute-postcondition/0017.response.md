The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. The value of `a` is a positive integer that is not divisible by 10, meaning the remainder when `a` is divided by 10 will be a digit from 1 to 9 (inclusive). Therefore, `h` will hold the last digit of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer not divisible by 10, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer greater than 0, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time; `h` is the last digit of `a` (1 to 9)**
