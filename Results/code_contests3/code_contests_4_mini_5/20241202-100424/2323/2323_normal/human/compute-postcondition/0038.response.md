The variable `a` is assigned the value of `10 ** c * h + a`. The previous value of `h` is determined by the current value of `a`, and `h` was assigned the value of `a % 10`. The variable `a` was previously updated to be the result of `a // 10`. 

The calculation involves the following:
- `10 ** c` represents 10 raised to the power of `c`.
- `h` is the last digit of the original `a`.
- The new value of `a` will be the result of multiplying `10 ** c` by `h` and then adding the previous value of `a`.

The output state reflects the current values of the variables after this calculation, but without specific values for `c`, `h`, and the previous `a`, we cannot produce exact numeric results.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer; `i` is incremented to `k + 1`; `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`; `a` is now updated to the result of `10 ** c * h + a`.**
