The value of `copya` is assigned the value `a // 10`, which means it is the integer division of `a` by 10. The code `copya //= 10` further modifies `copya` by performing another integer division of its current value by 10. Since `copya` was initially `a // 10`, the new value of `copya` becomes `(a // 10) // 10`, which is equivalent to `a // 100`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 100`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 100`**
