According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The `while` loop will continue as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is `a // 10`. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than zero. 

Since `copya` is `a // 10`, for it to be greater than zero, `a` must be at least 10. Therefore, `a` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 10.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 10`**
