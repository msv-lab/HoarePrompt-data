The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `c` is 0, after execution, `c` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 10`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 10`**.
