Postcondition: ***`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer. If the last digit of `a` is not zero, `a` is updated to 10, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `10 % b`. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1, `h` is assigned the last digit of `a`, and `a` is updated based on the expression defined in the program.***
