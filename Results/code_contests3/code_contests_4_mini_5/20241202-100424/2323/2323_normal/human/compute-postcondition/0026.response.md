According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current loop index, which must be adjusted by incrementing it by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `c`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration is not provided, we can say that `i` must be incremented by 1. 

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `c`, `i` is incremented by 1**
