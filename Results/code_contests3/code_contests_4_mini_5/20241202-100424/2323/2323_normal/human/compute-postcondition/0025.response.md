Postcondition: ***`Stepan's integer` is a string representation of a positive integer. If `a % 10 != 0`, then `a` is divided by 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `a % b`, and `h` is no longer valid. Otherwise, `a` is also divided by 10, but `ans` remains the result of `a % b`, `h` is set to 0, and `a` remains unchanged.***
