Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is reset to 1, `m` is unchanged, and `i` is greater than 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][1]` and we continue to the next iteration.***
