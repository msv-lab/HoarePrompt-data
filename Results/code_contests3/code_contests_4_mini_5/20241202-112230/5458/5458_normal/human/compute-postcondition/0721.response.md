The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution; for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2; `s` is at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
