According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop executes for `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`, which means `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to run. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would equal `s + 1`, which means before the loop starts, `k` should be initialized to `s + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `s` is greater than or equal to 1 (so that the range in the loop can cover at least one value), and `k` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is reset to 1, for the loop to execute again `m` must be unchanged**
