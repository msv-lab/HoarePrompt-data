According to the code, the loop iterates from `k = 1` to `k = s + 1`. For the loop to execute, it must start with `k` being within this range. Given that `k` is currently `s + 1`, the loop will not execute because `k` would be greater than `s + 1` when the loop tries to start. 

To allow the loop to execute, `k` must be adjusted to 1 (the starting point of the loop). Additionally, the value of `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to have any iterations (since it must encompass at least the range from 1 to `s + 1`). 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `s` is at least 1, `k` is now 1, and other variable states remain as they are.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is now 1, `i` is its final value, `j` is `j_final + 1`**
