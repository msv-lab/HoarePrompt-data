Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, while `k` remains 3. The state of other variables is not specified.***
