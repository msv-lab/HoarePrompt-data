According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can be incremented up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented to 2, and for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 (if previously it was 2) or 4 (if previously it was 3), `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
