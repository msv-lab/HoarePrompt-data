Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `i` is 2; `j` is `m + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3][m + 2][3]` is assigned the value 1, with no changes to `dp` if `j` is less than `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their values as 2, `m + 1`, and 3 respectively.***
