The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` without altering the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.**
