The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value of `i + 1` and applies a bitwise AND operation with `1`. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` evaluates to `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. Thus, the index `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. 

Now, `j + 1` evaluates to `2`, and `k` remains `3`. Therefore, the assignment effectively transfers the value of `dp[1][1][3]` to `dp[1][2][3]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `j` do not change, and there are no other side effects indicated.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`.**
