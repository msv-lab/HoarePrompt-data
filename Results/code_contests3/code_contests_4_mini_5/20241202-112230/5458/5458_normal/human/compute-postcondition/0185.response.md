Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 4, `k` is equal to `S`, `dp` remains unchanged, `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 3, and `k` will start at 1 during the loop execution. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
