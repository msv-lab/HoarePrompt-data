Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without executing the assignment.***
