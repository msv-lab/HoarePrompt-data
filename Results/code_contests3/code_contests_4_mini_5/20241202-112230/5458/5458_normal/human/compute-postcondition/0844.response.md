According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

At this point, `k` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`**
