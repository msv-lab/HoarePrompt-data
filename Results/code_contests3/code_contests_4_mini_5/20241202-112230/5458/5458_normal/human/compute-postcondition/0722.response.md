Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` is at least 2.***
