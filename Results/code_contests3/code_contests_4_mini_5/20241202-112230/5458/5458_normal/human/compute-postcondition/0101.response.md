The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][1]`.
