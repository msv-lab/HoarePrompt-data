The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
