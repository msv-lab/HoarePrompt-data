The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing any further statements in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
