Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is at least 4, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for valid `k`. Otherwise, `dp` will contain values based on the calculated indices from the previous iterations and the modulo `mod` operations applied.**
