`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The values for `i`, `j`, and `k` are such that `j` is 2, and `k` is 2, while `i` is not equal to 0. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. The value of `j + 1` becomes 3. Thus, the assignment affects the `dp` array at the indices determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]`**
