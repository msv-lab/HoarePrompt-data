Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip the current iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
