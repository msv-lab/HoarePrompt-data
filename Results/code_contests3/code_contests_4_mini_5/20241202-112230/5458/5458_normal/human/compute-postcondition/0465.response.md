Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2, then `dp[1][M + 2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][M + 1][1]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
