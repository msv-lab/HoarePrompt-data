Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`.***
