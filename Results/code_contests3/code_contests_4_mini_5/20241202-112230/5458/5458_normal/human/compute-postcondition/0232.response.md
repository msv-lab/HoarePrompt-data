Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, and `k` is `S + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, if `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
