The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration.
