According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `m`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The variables `N`, `S`, and `i` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 and `j` should be initialized to 1 (the starting point of the loop). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
