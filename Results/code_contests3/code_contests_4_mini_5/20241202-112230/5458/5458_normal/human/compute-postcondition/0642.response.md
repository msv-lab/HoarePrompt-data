According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have been incremented by 1 and would be equal to the next value in the range, which is `k + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, if `s` is equal to or greater than `k + 1`, then the loop can execute again. If the current value of `k` is at its maximum value `s`, the loop will not execute again. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be updated to `k + 1`, and the condition for the loop to execute again requires that `s` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be greater than k + 1, k is now k + 1.**
