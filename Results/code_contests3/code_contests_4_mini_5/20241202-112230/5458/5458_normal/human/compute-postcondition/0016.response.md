The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one position in a 3D array (or table) `dp` to another position. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. It effectively takes the least significant bit of `i + 1`. Since `i` is greater than 0, `i + 1` is at least 2, so `i + 1 & 1` will be 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
- `j + 1` increments `j` by 1, and since `j` is at least 1, `j + 1` will be at least 2.
- `k` remains unchanged.

The assignment implies that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `k`) are not affected by this operation, but the value in the dp structure is modified.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the modified state of the dp array.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
