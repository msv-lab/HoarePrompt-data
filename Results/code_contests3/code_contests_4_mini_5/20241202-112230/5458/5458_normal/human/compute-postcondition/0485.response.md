According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j`, which iterates over the range from 1 to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached a value between 1 and `M`. Since `M` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `M`. 

If we assume `j` is currently `M`, the loop cannot execute again. However, if `j` is currently less than `M`, it will increment by 1 for the next iteration. 

For the next iteration, `j` would need to be `j + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `M`. 

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `M`.**
