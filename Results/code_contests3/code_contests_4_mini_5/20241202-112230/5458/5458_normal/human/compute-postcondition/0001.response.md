According to the provided code, the loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely as long as the program is running. Therefore, there are no conditions or states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **N is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), M is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), S is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), and mod is set to 100000.**
