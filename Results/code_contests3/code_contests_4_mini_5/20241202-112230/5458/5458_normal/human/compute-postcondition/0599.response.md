Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is 5, and `i` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][6][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1, `dp[0][6][1]` is updated to `dp[1][5][1] % mod`, and `dp[1][6][1]` is updated based on the value from `dp[1][5][-4] % mod`, which likely results in 0 due to an out-of-bounds index.***
