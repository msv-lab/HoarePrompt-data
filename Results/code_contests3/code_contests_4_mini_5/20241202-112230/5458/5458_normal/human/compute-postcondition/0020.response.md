The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` retain their previous states as this operation only affects the `dp` array. 

Since `k` is at least `j`, `k - j` is non-negative, allowing the access to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The actual value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is not known from the initial state, but it will contribute to the update of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
