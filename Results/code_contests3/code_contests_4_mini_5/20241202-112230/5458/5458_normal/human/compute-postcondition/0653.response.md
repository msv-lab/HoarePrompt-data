Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k + 1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `s` is greater than `k + 1`, the loop can execute a second time.***
