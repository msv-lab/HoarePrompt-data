According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, starting from 1 and going up to `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take a value greater than its current value. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Given that `s` is at least 1, the next value of `k` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 3; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3.**
