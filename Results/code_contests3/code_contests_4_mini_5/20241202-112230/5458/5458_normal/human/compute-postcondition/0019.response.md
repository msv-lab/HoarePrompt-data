In the provided code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` represents an assignment operation where the value of the element at that index is updated based on the previous value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and a modulo operation with `mod`. 

The variable `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. The expression uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) which may affect how the value of `i + 1` is computed. However, given the context, we can infer that `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd. 

The other variables, `j`, `k`, and the state of `dp`, are not explicitly defined in terms of their prior values, but we know:
- `j` is 1.
- `k` is 1.

The expression assigns a new value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the current value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` taken modulo `mod`.

The output state, considering the information given, is as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
