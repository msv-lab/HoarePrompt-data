The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` affects the `dp` array. 

1. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` since `i` is `0`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be affected.
2. The operation `j + 1` will evaluate to `2` since `j` is `1`. Hence, the index becomes `dp[1][2][k]`.
3. The operation `k - j` will evaluate to `3 - 1`, which is `2`. Therefore, we access `dp[i & 1][j][2]`.
4. The operation `i & 1` will evaluate to `0` since `i` is `0`. Thus, we access `dp[0][1][2]`.

The specific value being added to `dp[1][2][3]` is `dp[0][1][2] % mod`.

Since `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, and the current values in the `dp` array are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[0][1][2]`, but we can state that `dp[1][2][3]` is updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][3]` is updated by adding `dp[0][1][2] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][3]` is updated by adding `dp[0][1][2] % mod**.
