Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[1][m + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][m][1]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, there is no change in the state of `dp`.***
