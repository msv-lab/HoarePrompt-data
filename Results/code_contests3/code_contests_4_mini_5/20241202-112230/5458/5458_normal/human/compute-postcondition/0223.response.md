Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][M + 2][S + 1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 3, `j` is `M + 1`, and `k` is `S + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
