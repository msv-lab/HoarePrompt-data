The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`, `i` is not equal to `0`, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
