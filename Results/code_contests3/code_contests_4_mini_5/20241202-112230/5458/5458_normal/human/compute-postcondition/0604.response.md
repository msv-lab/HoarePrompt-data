The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 6, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
