Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `j` is `j_final + 2`, with `j_final` less than `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, maintaining that `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is `j_final + 2`, and `j_final` is less than `m`.***
