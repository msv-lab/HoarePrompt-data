The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is taken modulo `mod`. The indices `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to access the specific elements in the 2D list `dp`. The exact values of `j` and `mod` are not provided, but `j` must be greater than `k` for the update to occur. Therefore, `dp` is modified at the specified indices while the values of `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value at `[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
