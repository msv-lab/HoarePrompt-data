According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, which means `k` will be incremented to `s + 1` for the next iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least `s + 1`, which is not possible.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration must reflect that the loop will not execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, for the loop not to execute again, `k` is `s + 1`.**
