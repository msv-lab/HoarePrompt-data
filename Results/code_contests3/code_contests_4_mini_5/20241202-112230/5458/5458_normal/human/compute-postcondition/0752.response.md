According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute one more time if `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 4. However, since `k` must remain less than or equal to `s` for the loop to continue, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4**
