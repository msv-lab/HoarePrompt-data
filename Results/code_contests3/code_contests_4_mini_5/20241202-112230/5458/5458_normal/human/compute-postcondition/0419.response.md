According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `M`, inclusive. Since `j` is currently set to `M + 1`, it indicates that the loop has already executed once and is at the point where it would not execute again unless `j` is reset.

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be reset to a value within the range defined by `xrange(1, M + 1)`, which is from `1` to `M`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `1` to allow for executing the loop again. 

Additionally, `i`, `N`, and `S` do not affect the loop execution directly, so they can remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is `S`**
