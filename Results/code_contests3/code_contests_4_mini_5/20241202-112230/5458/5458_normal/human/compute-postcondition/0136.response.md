The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. This means that the values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remain unchanged, but we are breaking out of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 3, `k` is 3; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
