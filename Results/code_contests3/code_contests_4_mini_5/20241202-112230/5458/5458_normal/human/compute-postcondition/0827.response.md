Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is equal to the final value of `s`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is `j_final + 2`, with `j_final` being less than `m`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s + 1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values and the modulo operation.**
