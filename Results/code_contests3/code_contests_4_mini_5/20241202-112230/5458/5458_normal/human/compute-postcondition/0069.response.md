Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any action.***
