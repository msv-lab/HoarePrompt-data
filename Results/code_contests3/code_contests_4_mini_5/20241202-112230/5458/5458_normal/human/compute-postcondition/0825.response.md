The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is unchanged, but it now includes the result of the addition. The variables `dp`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, and since `j` is greater than `k`, the expression `k - j` might lead to an invalid index or negative value, depending on the context, but we assume valid operations based on the problem statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
