According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 1 (the starting value of the loop). Since `s` is at least 3, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` will need to increment by 1.

Thus, after the current iteration, `k` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is still satisfied since `s` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is 2 and must be less than or equal to `s`.**
