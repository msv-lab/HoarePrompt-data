The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. The initial state indicates that `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`, and `k` is 1. This operation modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the calculation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
