According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and since `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is at least 1, resulting in `n ** 2` being at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. If `i` is 0, it will be incremented to 1; if `i` is 1, it will be incremented to 2. Thus, we need to consider how this affects the loop's ability to continue. 

Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, and the condition for the loop to execute again is `i < n ** 2`, we can deduce that for the loop to execute a second time, `n ** 2` must be greater than 1 (if `i` was 1) or greater than 2 (if `i` was 0).

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S`, for the loop to execute a second time `n ** 2` must be greater than 2.**
