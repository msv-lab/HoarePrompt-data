Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is `S`. The dp array is updated based on the conditions of the loop, with `dp[1][2][k]` being assigned values based on comparisons of `j` and `k`, and potentially derived from previous states of the dp array.**
