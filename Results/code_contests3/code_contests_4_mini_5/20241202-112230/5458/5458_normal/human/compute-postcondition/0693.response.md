Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution. After all iterations, if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s + 1`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s + 1]` is equal to 1; otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values of `dp` under the conditions specified. `j` remains at least 2 and `s` is a non-negative integer.**
