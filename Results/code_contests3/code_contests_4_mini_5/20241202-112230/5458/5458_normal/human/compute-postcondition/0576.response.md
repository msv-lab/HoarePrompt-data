According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `S`, which means it will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have taken on the value of `S`. Since `S` is a positive integer and the loop is set to iterate up to `S`, the next value of `k` would be `S + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` is updated to `S + 1`, and since the loop condition is `k in xrange(1, s + 1)`, we also need to confirm that `S` remains at least 2 (as per the initial state). 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted accordingly:

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be `S + 1`.**
