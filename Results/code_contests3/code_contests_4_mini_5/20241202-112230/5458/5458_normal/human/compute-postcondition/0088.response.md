According to the code, the loop iterates with `k` ranging from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `S`. Since `k` is incremented with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1.

Currently, `k` is `S`, so for the next iteration, it will be `S + 1`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S + 1`, which means `s` must be at least `S + 1` (since `S` is a positive integer and `s` is at least 3).

Therefore, the adjusted state must reflect that `k` is now `S + 1` and for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least `S + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `S + 1` for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least `S + 1`**
