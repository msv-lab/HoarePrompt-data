The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is still assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as before the statement.
