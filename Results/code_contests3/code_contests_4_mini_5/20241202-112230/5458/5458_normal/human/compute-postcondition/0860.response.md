To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state. 

1. In the initial state, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Here, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3. This indicates that the value at `dp[1][m + 1][3]` is being updated based on the value from `dp[0][m + 1][3]` modulo `mod`.

2. The second line of code is executed next: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. This means that the value at `dp[1][m + 1][3]` is further updated by adding the value from `dp[0][m + 1][k - j] % mod`.

3. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are known. The calculation for `j - j` (where `j` is `m + 1`) implies that we need to check `k - j`, which is `3 - (m + 1) = 2 - m`. This will be used to find the value from `dp[0][m + 1][2 - m]`.

Based on this information, the output state reflects the updated values of the `dp` array and the values of the other variables involved.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and also updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 3.**
