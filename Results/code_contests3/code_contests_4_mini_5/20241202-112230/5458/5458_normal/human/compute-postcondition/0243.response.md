According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at the maximum value of `M`, but since the loop ranges from `1` to `M + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will need to be incremented to `M + 1`. 

Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `j` will be `M + 1`, which is the next integer after `M`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `S + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be `M + 1`**
