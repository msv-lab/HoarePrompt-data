The values of the variables do not change because the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `M + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 on the first iteration, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[1][M + 2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][M + 1][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
