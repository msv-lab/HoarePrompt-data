According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, where `s` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would be equal to `s` for the loop to be executed one more time, which means that in the next iteration `k` will be incremented to `s + 1`, making it out of the loop's range.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
