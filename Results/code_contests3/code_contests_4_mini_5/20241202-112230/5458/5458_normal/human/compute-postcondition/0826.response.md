Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is `j_final + 2`, with `j_final` less than `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
