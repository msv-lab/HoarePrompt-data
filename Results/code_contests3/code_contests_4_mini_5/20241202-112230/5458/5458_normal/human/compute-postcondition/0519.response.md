According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3**
