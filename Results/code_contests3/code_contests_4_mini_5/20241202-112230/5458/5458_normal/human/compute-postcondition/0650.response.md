Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 and `k` is incremented by 1, allowing the loop to execute one more time since `s` must be greater than `k + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value, while the dimensions of `dp` remain unchanged.***
