Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
