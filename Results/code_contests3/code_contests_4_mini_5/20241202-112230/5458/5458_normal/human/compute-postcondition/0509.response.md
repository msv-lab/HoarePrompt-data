The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` do not directly affect this assignment. The variable `k` is given as `4`, and its value is used as part of the index. However, without specific values for `i` and `j`, we can't further specify the exact index being modified in the `dp` array.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1.**
