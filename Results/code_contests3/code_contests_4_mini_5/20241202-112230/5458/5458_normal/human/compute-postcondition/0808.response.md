Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; `j` is `j_final + 2`; `j_final` is less than `m`; if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, maintaining that `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j_final` is still less than `m`.***
