Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][M + 2][S + 1]` is assigned the value `1` if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the defined conditions involving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` for all iterations.**
