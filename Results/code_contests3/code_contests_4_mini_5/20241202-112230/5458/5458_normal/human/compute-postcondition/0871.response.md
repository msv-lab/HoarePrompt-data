The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one specific index of the `dp` list to another. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to 0, it will be either 1 or 2 (but this will map to either 0 or 1 in the `dp` array due to the bitwise AND operation with 1).
2. The variable `j` is greater than `k`, and since `k` is 1, `j` must be at least 2.
3. The assignment takes the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and assigns it to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

The values of `dp` are affected, while `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at the specific indices defined by `i`, `j`, and `k`; `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at the specific indices defined by `i`, `j`, and `k`; `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k**.
