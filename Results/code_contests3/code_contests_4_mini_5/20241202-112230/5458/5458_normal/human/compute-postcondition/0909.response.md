Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is reset to 1, and `m` is unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][2][1] with the value of `dp[i & 1][1][1]`.***
