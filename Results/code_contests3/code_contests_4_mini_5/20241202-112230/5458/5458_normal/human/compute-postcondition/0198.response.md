According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4 and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (which is at least 3) plus 1. 

However, since `k` is currently 4, the loop can only execute if `k` is less than or equal to `s`, which means that `s` must be at least 4 to allow for one more iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be incremented to 5, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 4, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be 5**
