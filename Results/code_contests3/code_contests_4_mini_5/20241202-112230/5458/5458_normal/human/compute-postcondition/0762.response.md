According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has its respective final value, and `m` is known. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. 

Letâ€™s assume the final value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is `j_final`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j_final + 1` should be less than or equal to `m`. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is the final value of `s`, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is its final value, `j` is `j_final + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
