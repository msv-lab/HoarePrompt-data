The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The current values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `k` is set to 1 by the loop; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
