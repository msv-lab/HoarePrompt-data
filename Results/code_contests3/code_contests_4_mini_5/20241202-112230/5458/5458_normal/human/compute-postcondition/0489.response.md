The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, thus `i + 1` is `1`, and `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is `j + 1`, and since `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is `2`), `j + 1` is at least `3`. The value of `k` is `2`. Therefore, the indices used in the assignment are `1`, `j + 1` (which is at least `3`), and `2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is 2 and less than or equal to `S`, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is now `1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `k` is 2 and less than or equal to `S`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is now `1`.**
