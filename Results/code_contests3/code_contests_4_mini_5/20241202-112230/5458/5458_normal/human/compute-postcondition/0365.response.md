According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Given that the current state indicates `k` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be incremented by 1 to 2. Additionally, `s` is at least 1, meaning that for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 2 and `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
