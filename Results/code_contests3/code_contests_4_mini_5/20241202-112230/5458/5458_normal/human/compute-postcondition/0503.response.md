The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `S` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
