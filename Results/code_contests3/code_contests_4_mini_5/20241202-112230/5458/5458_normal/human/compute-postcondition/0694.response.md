According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` remains at least 2, which means it is currently 2 or greater. The loop is designed to start from 1 and continue up to `m`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will increase by 1.

Thus, if the current value of `j` is 2, it will become 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted accordingly and it can execute again as long as `m` is at least 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute one more time, and `m` must be at least 3.**
