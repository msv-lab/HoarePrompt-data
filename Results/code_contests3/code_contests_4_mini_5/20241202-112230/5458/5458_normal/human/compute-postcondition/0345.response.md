The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
