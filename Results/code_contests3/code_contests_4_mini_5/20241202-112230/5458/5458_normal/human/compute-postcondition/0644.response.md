Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, and `k` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than `k + 1`.***
