According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from `1` to `S`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. Given that `k` is equal to `S` before the loop starts, it indicates that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `S + 1`. 

Additionally, the loop will need the current values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `j` to remain unchanged to ensure the integrity of any conditions or calculations that depend on them.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `i` is 3, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.**
