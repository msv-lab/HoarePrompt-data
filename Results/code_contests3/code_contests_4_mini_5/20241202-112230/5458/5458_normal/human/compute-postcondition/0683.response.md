Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is `s + 1` and `s` is greater than or equal to 2), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, resulting in a new value for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
