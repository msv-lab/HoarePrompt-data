The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2]` is set to `dp[1][1][2]`, while we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
