Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, where `k - j` results in a negative index.***
