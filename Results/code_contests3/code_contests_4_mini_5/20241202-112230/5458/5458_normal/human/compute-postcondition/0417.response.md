Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S`, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions involving `j` and `k`, reflecting the computations made throughout all iterations of the loops.**
