According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper bound defined by `M`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `M` is at least 3, which means that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented. After incrementing `j`, it will be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `M` must be greater than 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 4, `k` is equal to `S`, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
