The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
