According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. In order for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, if the loop executes again, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute once more, `n` must be such that \( n^2 \) is greater than 2. This means that `n` must be at least 2, since \( 2^2 = 4 \), and the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is still less than \( n^2 \).

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is 2.**
