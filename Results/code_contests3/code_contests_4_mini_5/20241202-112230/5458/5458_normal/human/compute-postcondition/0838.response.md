The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is 2, thus `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which is `1`. The variable `j` is `m + 1`, and since `j` is greater than `k` (which is 1), the assignment takes place. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `dp[1][m + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][m][1]`.**
