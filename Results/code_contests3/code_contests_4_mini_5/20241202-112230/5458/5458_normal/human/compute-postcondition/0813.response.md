The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `j` is `j_final + 2`; `j_final` is less than `m`; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
