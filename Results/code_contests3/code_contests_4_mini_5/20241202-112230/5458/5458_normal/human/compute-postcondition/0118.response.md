The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 2, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 2, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
