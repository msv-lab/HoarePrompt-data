The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop that we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `i` is 3, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S + 1`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
