Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) values reflecting the results of the computations based on the conditions defined in the loop, where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` represents combinations depending on the values of `j`, `k`, and the initial value of `i`, with `i` being 1 at the end of all iterations. If `n` is less than 1, `dp` remains initialized with zeros.**
