Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a value derived from `dp[0][m + 1][1 - (m + 1)] % mod`.***
