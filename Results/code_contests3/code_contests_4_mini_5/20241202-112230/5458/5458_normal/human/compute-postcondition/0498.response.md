Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 2 and less than or equal to `S`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
