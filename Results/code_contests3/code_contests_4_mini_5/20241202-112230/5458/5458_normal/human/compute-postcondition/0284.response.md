The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indexing uses the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, but without specific values for `i`, `j`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact indices or values in `dp`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer.
- `M` is at least `M`.
- `S` is at least `S`.
- `k` is 1.
- `j` is 2 and must be at most `M`.
- `i` is not equal to 0.
- `j` is greater than `k`.

The operation assigns the value from one position in the `dp` array to another. The positions affected are:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` (on the left-hand side)
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` (on the right-hand side)

Since `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0, we assume that `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1, depending on the parity of `i`.

However, without specific values for `dp`, we cannot detail the exact numbers in the array. The overall structure indicates that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, but the specific values are unknown.

Therefore, the output state, acknowledging the assignment without further details about the contents of `dp`, can be inferred as follows:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 1, `j` is 2 and must be at most `M`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
