Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][2][2]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, the state remains unchanged. In the else case, `dp[1][2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][1][1] % mod`.***
