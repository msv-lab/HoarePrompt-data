Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
