The code assigns the value `1` to the element in a 3D list `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are currently `0`, `3`, and `S + 1` respectively.

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. 
- `j + 1` evaluates to `4`.
- `k` is `S + 1`.

Therefore, the index `[1][4][S + 1]` in the `dp` array is set to `1`. The previous values of the other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`) are unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp[1][4][S + 1]` is set to 1.**
