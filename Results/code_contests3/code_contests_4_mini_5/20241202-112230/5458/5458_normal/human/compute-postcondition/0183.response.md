In the provided code, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The impact of this assignment is that the value at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Since `i` is at least 2, the expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1` based on the least significant bit of `i + 1`. The value of `j` is 4, and since `j + 1` is 5, the state of the `dp` array at `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][k]` will now reflect the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]`. 

The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `s`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged in this operation. 

Therefore, the output state remains dependent on the unchanged variables as described:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 4, `k` is equal to `S`, `dp` remains unchanged, `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 3, `k` will start at 1 during the loop execution, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
