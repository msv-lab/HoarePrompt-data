Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is either 3 (if previously it was 2) or 4 (if previously it was 3), `s` is at least 1, `k` is initialized to 1 for the loop to execute; if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
