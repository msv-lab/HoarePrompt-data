According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from `1` to `s` (inclusive). The loop can execute again if `k` is less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `2`, and since `S` is at least `2`, `s` must be at least `2` as well. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to `3`, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least `3`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `2`, `k` is `3`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least `3`.**
