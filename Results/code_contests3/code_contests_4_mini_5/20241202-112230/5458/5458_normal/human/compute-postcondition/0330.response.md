The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 

The previous values of the variables are:
- `i` is not equal to 0, indicating that `i` can be either 1 or greater.
- `j` is 1.
- `k` is at least 1, meaning `k - j` will still be non-negative since `j` is 1.

Given this, the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` contributes to the new value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Other variables, such as `N`, `M`, `S`, and `s`, do not affect this operation.

The output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` after the addition.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
