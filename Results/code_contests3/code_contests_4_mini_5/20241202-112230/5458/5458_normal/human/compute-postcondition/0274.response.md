Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `2`, and `k` is `4`. If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
