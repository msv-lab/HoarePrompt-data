Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is `M`, and `k` is `S`. The dp array is updated based on the conditions of the loop, reflecting the accumulated values derived from previous states and conditions evaluated during all iterations.**
