The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to 0, the result will be either 1 (if `i` is odd) or 0 (if `i` is even). The value of `j` is greater than `k`, and `j` is assigned the index `j + 1`, which is valid since `j_final` is less than `m`. The states of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated. The exact values of the variables do not change, but the state of the 2D list modifies based on the assignment.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
