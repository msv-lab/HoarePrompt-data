The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
