According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, thus changing `k` to 2. Additionally, `s` must still be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `j` is `j_final + 2`; `j_final` is less than `m`**
