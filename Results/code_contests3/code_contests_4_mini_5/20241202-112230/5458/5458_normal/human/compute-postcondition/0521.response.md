According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. Since `S` is a positive integer, the loop will execute for `k` from 1 to `S` (inclusive). For the loop to execute a total of `S` times, it starts from `k = 1` and goes up to `k = S`. 

As we want the loop to execute the third time, `k` should be 3 when the loop executes for the third time. This means `S` must be at least 3. Additionally, `i` and `j` do not affect the execution of the loop directly; they are irrelevant for the loop iteration count.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `S` is at least 3 and `k` is 3**
