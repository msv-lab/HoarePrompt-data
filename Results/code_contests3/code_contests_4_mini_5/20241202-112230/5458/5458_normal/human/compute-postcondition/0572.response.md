Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop without making any changes to the variable states.***
