The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned from the input, which is read and split into three integers. The previous values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers, and the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are now assigned those values directly from the input. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S`, `n` is the input value for `N`, `m` is the input value for `M`, `s` is the input value for `S`**
