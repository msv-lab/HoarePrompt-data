Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `j` is 1, and `m` is unchanged. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][1][1] % mod`.***
