The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
