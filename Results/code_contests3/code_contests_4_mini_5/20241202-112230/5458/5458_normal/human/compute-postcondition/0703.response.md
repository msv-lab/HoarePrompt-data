The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
