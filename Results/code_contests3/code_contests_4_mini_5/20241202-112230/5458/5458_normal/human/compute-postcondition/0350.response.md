Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1 (depending on the final iteration), `j` is 1 or 2 (at most), `s` is at least 1, `k` is `S`. The values of `dp` are updated based on conditions involving `j` and `k`, where `dp[1][2][k]` may be either set to 1 or calculated based on previous values of `dp`.**
