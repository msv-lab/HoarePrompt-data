Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are integers with `N` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M`, `S`, and `s` being at least 1, `i` being either 0 or 1, `j` being either 2 or 3, and `k` equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated such that either `dp[1][3][3]`, `dp[1][4][3]`, `dp[0][3][3]`, or `dp[0][4][3]` is set to 1 based on the values of `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
