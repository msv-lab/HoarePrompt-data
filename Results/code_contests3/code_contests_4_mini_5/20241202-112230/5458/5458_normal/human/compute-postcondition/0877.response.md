According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 1 and `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be 2, and `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
