According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. The loop iterates from 1 to `S`, inclusive. Since `S` is a positive integer, the loop can execute at least once. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be able to take on a value of 2 (which it will if `S` is at least 2). Given that `i` is already 2, it indicates that the loop has executed once and `k` is currently at 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `S` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is 2**
