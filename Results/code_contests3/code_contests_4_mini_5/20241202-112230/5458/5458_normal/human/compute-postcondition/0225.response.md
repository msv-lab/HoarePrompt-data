Given the initial state where `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, and `k` is `s + 1`, the statement provided is an assignment to a multidimensional array `dp`.

The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array at the indices defined by the expression `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` determines which index to access in the first dimension of the `dp` array. This results in either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
2. The second dimension is accessed with `j + 1`, which will be at least `1` since `j` is assumed to be at least `0`.
3. The third dimension is accessed with `k`, which is defined as `s + 1`.

The actual values of `i`, `j`, and `s` are not provided, but the operation assigns the value `1` to the specified position in the `dp` array according to the indices derived from `i`, `j`, and `s`.

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unaffected by this operation, as they are not being modified.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the entry `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`**.
