Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value `1`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, under the condition that the loop continues while `s` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is not equal to 0.***
