Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` and/or `dp[1][4][1]` are set to 1. If `i` is 1, no update occurs to `dp` due to invalid indices.***
