The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
