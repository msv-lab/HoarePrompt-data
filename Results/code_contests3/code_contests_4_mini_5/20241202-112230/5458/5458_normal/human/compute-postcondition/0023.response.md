The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific location in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indices of the array are determined by the expressions `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1`.
- `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` is `2`.
- `k` is `2`.

Thus, the assignment translates to `dp[1][2][2] = 1`.

The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are not directly affected by this operation, and since they are not used in the code, their state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][2][2] = 1**.
