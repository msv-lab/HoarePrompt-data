According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. The loop iterates from `1` to `S`, inclusive. Given that `S` is a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, the states are as follows:
- `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `M` is at least 5.
- `S` is a positive integer.
- `j` is 5.
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`.

For the loop to execute:
- `S` must be at least 1 for the loop to run.
- The initial value of `k` starts from 1.

Since `S` is given as a positive integer, it will always be at least 1. The initial value of `k` will also be 1 when the loop starts executing.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is 5, `i` is either 0 or 1, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, and `k` is 1 for the loop to execute**.
