Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `S` is at least 3, allowing for the continuation to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the program state.***
