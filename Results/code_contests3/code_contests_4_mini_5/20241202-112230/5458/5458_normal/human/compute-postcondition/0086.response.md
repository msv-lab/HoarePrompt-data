The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unaffected by this operation. Since `k` is initially set to `S` and `j` is 3, the value of `k - j` will be `S - 3`. Therefore, the output state reflects these variables and the change to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `S`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][S - 3] % mod` to it.**
