According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `S + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `S + 1`, which means the loop has already executed for `k = S + 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the range. Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `S + 1`, the next value of `k` would be `S + 2`. However, since `k` cannot exceed `S + 1` in the for loop's range, the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be adjusted back to 1, and `S` must be at least 1 (which is already satisfied since `S` is a positive integer). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `k` must be 1.**
