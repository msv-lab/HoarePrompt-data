Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
