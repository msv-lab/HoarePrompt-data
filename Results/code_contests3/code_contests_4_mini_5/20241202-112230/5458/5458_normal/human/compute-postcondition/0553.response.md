According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `M`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `M` is at least 3, and `j` must have been incremented by 1 from its previous value in order to execute one more time.

If `j` was `m`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be `m + 1`, and `M` must be at least greater than `m`. Since M is at least 3, we can assume `m` is less than or equal to M.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 3, and `j` is `m + 1`.**
