The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` equals `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is `j_final + 1`, and since `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), `j + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
