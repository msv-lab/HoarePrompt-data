Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is 1, and `m` is unchanged. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][1][2] % mod`, while `s`, `k`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged.***
