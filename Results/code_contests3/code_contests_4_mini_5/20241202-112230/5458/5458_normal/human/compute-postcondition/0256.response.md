Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `2`, `k` is `2`. If `i` is equal to `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `0` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
