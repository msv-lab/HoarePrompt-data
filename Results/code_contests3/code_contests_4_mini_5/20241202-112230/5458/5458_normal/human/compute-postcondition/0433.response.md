According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `S`. If `k` is less than or equal to `S`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is currently at its last value in the range, which is `s`. 

Since the loop starts from `k = 1` and goes up to `k = S`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be `S + 1`, which means that the loop will execute again if `S` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than `S`, so `k` is `S + 1`**.
