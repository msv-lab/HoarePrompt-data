The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` indicates that the value at a specific index in a 3D list (or array) `dp` is being set to `1`. 

1. The variable `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` becomes `1`. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1`.
2. The variable `j` is `M + 1`. Since `M` is a positive integer, `j + 1` will be at least `M + 2`.
3. The variable `k` is `1` on the first iteration.

This means we are accessing `dp[1][j + 1][1]` and assigning it the value `1`.

The values of `N`, `S`, and `M` remain unchanged, and the operation affects only the `dp` array. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is `M + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 on the first iteration, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
