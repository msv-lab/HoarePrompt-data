The command `continue` does not change any variable values but causes the loop in which it is executed to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

The Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop.
