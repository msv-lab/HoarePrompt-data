According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `M`, inclusive. In this case, `M` is at least 3, and `j` is at least 4 at the end of the last iteration. This means that the loop has already executed for `j = 1`, `j = 2`, and `j = 3`, and is currently at `j = 4`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, leading to `j = 5`. Given that `M` is at least 3, `j` must be less than or equal to `M` for the loop to continue; therefore, `M` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is 5, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`.**
