The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves the following steps:

1. The variable `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1.
2. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` will result in 1.
3. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to 2, so `j + 1` will be at least 3.
4. The variable `k` is 2, which is used directly.

Thus, the assignment updates `dp[1][j + 1][2]` to 1, indicating that a specific position in the 2D list `dp` is set to 1.

The values of `s`, `k`, `i`, and the original state of `dp` are not affected by this assignment, other than the specific position in `dp`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at position `[1][j + 1][2]` to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at position `[1][j + 1][2]` to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2.**
