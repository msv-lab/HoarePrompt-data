Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k` with `k` equal to 2 and `s` at least 2, the assignment does not take effect due to invalid indexing.***
