Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is either 5 or 6, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` is incremented to 6 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
