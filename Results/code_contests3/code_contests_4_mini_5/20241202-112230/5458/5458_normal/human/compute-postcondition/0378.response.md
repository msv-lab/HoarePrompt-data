The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.
