The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals 1.
2. `j` is currently 3, so `j + 1` equals 4.
3. `k` is currently 1.
4. The right side of the assignment is `dp[1][3][1]`, and the left side of the assignment is `dp[1][4][1]`.

Thus, we are assigning the value of `dp[1][3][1]` to `dp[1][4][1]`. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and only `dp` is affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][1]`.**
