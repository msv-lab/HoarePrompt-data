According to the code, the for loop is designed to iterate over a range defined by `m`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 to `m`, inclusive. 

Since the state mentions that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `m` is also at least 2 so that the loop can execute again after the first iteration. At the start of the second iteration, `j` will be 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the second time, the following states need to be established: `m` must be at least 2, and `j` is now 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), for the loop to execute a second time `m` is at least 2 and `j` is 2**
