Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][2][1]` is updated by adding `dp[0][1][0] % mod` to its previous value.***
