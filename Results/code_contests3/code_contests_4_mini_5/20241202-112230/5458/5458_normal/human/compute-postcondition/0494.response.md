The execution of `continue` does not alter the values of the variables directly; instead, it causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged, but we note that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is now incremented, `k` is 2 and is less than or equal to `S`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
