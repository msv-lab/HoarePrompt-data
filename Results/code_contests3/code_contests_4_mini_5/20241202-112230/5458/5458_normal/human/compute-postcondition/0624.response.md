The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S`, `n` is the input value for `N`, `m` is the input value for `M`, `s` is the input value for `S` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
