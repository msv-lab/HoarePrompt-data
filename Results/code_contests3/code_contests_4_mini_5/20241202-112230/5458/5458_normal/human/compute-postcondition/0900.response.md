The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` indicates that we are assigning the value `1` to a specific position in the 2D list `dp`. 

Let's break down the indices used in the assignment:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`.
- The `&` operator is a bitwise AND, and the result of `1 & 1` is `1`. Thus, the first index simplifies to `1`.
- `j` is reset to `1`, so `j + 1` becomes `2`.
- `k` is `1`, which is unchanged.

Therefore, we are assigning `1` to `dp[1][2][1]`. 

The values of `s`, `m`, and other variables do not change, and the assignment only affects the `dp` list.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is reset to 1, `m` must be unchanged, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.**
