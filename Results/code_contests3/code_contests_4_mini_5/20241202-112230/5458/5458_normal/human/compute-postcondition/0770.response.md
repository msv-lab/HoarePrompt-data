The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` determine which elements of the `dp` list are being accessed, but since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the calculation proceeds without issues. The values of `dp` at the mentioned indices are updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and remains unchanged at other positions; `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is its final value, `j` is `j_final + 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and remains unchanged at other positions; `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is its final value, `j` is `j_final + 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
