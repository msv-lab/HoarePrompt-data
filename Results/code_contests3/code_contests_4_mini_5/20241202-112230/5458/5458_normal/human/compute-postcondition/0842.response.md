The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 2, `m + 1`, and 1, respectively. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 0 (since `i + 1` is 3, and `3 & 1` is 1, but in the context of updating `dp`, we consider the modulus with respect to the dimensions). The value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is taken from `dp[2 & 1][m + 1][1 - (m + 1)]`, which simplifies to `dp[0][m + 1][1 - (m + 1)]`. 

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a value derived from `dp[0][m + 1][1 - (m + 1)] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with a value derived from `dp[0][m + 1][1 - (m + 1)] % mod`**
