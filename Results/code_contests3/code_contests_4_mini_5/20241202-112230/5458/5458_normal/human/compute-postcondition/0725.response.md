Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 2) while `s` is at least 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and the state of `dp` is updated accordingly.***
