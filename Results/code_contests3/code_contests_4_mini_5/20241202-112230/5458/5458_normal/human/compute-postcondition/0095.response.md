The code executed is:

```
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. 
2. The variable `j` is 3, so `j + 1` evaluates to `4`.
3. The variable `k` is `S + 1`, which is greater than or equal to `4` since `S` is a positive integer. 
4. The expression `k - j` evaluates to `(S + 1) - 3`, which simplifies to `S - 2`. 

Now we need to consider the array access:

- We are accessing `dp[1][4][k]` on the left-hand side.
- On the right-hand side, we access `dp[0][3][S - 2] % mod`.

The operation adds the value of `dp[0][3][S - 2] % mod` to `dp[1][4][k]`.

Since no specific values of `dp` or `mod` are provided, we cannot determine the exact numeric outputs, but we can indicate that `dp[1][4][k]` is modified based on the value of `dp[0][3][S - 2]`.

The output state will reflect the access and modification without specific values:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `S + 1`, `dp[1][4][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][3][S - 2] % mod`.**
