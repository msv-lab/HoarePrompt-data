The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is designed to process input data from multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of three integers, `N`, `M`, and `S`, which are constrained by the following conditions: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), and `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000). The input ends when the dataset "0 0 0" is encountered. 

The function processes these datasets and produces output based on the values of `N`, `M`, and `S`. The specific output behavior is not detailed, so the exact return value is not described. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of three integers, N, M, and S, constrained by specified ranges, and continues until the dataset "0 0 0" is encountered.**
