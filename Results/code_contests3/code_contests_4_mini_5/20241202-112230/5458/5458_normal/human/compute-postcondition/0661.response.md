According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the upper bound `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 (the first value in the range), and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
