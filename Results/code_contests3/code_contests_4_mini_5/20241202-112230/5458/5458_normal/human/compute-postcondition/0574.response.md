Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
