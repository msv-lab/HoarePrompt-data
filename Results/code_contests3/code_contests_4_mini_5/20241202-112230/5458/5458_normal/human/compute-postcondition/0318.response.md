According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `m`. The loop runs for `j` starting from 1 to `m`. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The values of `N`, `S`, and `i` do not affect the execution of this loop directly. 

To ensure the loop executes, the state of `m` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1, and `j` will start from 1 on the first iteration. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
