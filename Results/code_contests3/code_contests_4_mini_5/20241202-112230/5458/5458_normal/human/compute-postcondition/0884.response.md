The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. Given that `j` is greater than `k`, we can deduce that `k - j` will be negative, which typically results in an undefined or zero value for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` in common implementations of dynamic programming. Thus, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified based on this operation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which is assumed to be zero or undefined due to the condition of `j > k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` (likely zero or undefined due to `j > k`)**.
