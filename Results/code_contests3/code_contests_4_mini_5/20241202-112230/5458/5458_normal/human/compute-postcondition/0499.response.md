According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take a value of 3 (since it starts from 1 and goes up to `s`, which is at least 2). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3**
