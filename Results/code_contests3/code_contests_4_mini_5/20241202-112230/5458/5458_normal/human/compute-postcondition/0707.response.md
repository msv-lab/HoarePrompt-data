Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1] % mod`, while `j` remains 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1; `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is not defined or ignored due to negative index.***
