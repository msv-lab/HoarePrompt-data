Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 3 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
