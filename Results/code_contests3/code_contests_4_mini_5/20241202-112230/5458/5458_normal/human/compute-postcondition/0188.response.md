Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, and `j` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][k]` is set to 1 while `dp` remains unchanged; otherwise, there is no change in the program state. If `i` is at least 2, `dp` has been updated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.***
