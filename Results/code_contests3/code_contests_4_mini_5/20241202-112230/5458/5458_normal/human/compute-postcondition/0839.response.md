The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `dp[1][m + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][m][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
