According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is structured to iterate from 1 to `s` inclusive. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. Given that `S` is a positive integer, it ensures that `s` will also be at least 1. The index `k` will start at 1 for the first iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `k` should be initialized to 1, and `s` is already ensured to be at least 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
