The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is `j_final + 2`, with `j_final` less than `m`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
