The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value from `dp[1][2][2]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
