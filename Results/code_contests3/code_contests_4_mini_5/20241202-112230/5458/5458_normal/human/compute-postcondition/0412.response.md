Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, the `dp` array is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables.***
