In the given code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `k` is fixed at 3, and the variable `j` lies between 2 and `M`. The loop is set to execute a second time based on the condition that `S` must be at least 3, which is satisfied since `S` is at least `S`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Since the specific values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and the current state of the `dp` array are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values that will be assigned. However, we know that the state of the `dp` array is being modified.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `S` is at least 3**.
