The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
