According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means it can execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`. This indicates that the loop has completed its iterations, and `j` has reached the end of the range.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its current value of `m + 1` to `m + 2`, but since it has already reached the upper limit, the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, the state must reflect that the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is the final value of `s`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 2`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
