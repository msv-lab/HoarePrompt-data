According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the value of `k` is at least 1 and must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and we need to adjust `k` to be 2, given that `k` starts from 1. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2, and `s` is at least 2.**
