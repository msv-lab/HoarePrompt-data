According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `M`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently 1, and since `M` is at least `M`, this means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be at most `M`, and since `M` is at least `M`, it is still valid for the next iteration. Therefore, the states need to reflect that `j` has increased to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `S + 1`, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be at most `M` and `j` is 2.**
