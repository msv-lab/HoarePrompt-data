According to the code, the for loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `S + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `2` and must be less than or equal to `s + 1`. 

Since `k` is currently `S + 1`, it cannot be incremented further without exceeding the specified range. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again if `k` is at `S + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `S + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**.
