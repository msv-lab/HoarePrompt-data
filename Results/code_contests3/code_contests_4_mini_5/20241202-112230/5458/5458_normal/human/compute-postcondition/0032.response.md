The code assigns the value `1` to the 3D array `dp` at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`, and `k` is `3`, we can evaluate the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `2`.
- `k` remains `3`.

The output state will reflect that the value `1` is assigned to `dp[1][2][3]`. The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value 1.**
