According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `M`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `M` must be at least 1. Here, `N`, `S`, and `i` do not directly influence the loop's execution. 

To determine the state for the loop to execute for the third time, we need to note that the loop will execute 1, 2, and then 3 times. Thus, `M` must be at least 3. The loop variable `j` will be 3 during the third execution.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the third time**
