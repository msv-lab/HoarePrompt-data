The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Other variables, including `s`, `k`, and the dimensions of `dp`, are not affected directly by this assignment. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided; hence we cannot determine exact values for the elements of `dp`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
