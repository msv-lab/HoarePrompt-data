The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is 5, `i` is 1, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute, and `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[0][6][1]` is updated to `dp[0][5][1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is 5, `i` is 1, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute, and `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[0][6][1]` is updated to `dp[0][5][1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
