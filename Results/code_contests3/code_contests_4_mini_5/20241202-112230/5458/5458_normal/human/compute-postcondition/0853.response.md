According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

After the current iteration, `k` will become 3. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the third time as long as `s` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 2, and `j` is `m + 1`.**
