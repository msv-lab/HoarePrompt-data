According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `S`, the next value for `k` will be 3.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be 3, and `S` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 3, and `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`. For the loop to execute a second time, `S` must be at least 3.**
