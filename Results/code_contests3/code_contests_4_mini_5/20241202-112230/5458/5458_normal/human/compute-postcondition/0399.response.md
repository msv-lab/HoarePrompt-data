The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indices used for accessing the array are determined by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1`:
   - If `i` is `0`, then `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` is `1`.
   - If `i` is `1`, then `i + 1` is `2`, and `2 & 1` is `0`.

2. The expression `j + 1` will be `4` if `j` is `3`, or `5` if `j` is `4`.

3. The variable `k` is `2`, which is given.

Therefore, the indices for the `dp` array are affected based on the current values of `i` and `j`. The specific index accessed will depend on the current values of these variables.

Assuming:
- If `i` is 0, `j` is 3, then the indices would be `dp[1][4][2] = 1`.
- If `i` is 0, `j` is 4, then the indices would be `dp[1][5][2] = 1`.
- If `i` is 1, `j` is 3, then the indices would be `dp[0][4][2] = 1`.
- If `i` is 1, `j` is 4, then the indices would be `dp[0][5][2] = 1`.

However, the actual values of `dp` and how they interact with the indices are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the impact of this statement is that it sets a specific value in the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`dp` array is updated at indices determined by current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` to 1.**
