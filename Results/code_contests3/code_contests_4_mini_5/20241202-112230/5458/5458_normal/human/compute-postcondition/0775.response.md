Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is now 1, and if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `i` is its final value and `j` is `j_final + 1`.***
