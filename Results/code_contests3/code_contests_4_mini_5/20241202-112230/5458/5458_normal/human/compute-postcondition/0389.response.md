Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is either 3 or 4, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is initialized to 1 for the loop to execute. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
