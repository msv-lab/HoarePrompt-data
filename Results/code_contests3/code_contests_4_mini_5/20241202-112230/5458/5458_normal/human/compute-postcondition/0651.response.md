According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s` and the current value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` was set to 1 and `k` was incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than `k + 1`. 

If `k` was incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, the new value of `k` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed again, `k` must be the new value which is `k + 1`, and `s` must be greater than this new value. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than `k + 1`, and `k` is `k + 1`.**
