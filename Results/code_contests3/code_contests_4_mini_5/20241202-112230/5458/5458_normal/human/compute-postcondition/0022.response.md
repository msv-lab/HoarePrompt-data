According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `S`. The loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `S` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `S` must be at least 2**.
