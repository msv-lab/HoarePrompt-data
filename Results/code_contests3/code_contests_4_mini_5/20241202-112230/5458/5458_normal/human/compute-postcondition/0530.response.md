Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 3, and `i` is not equal to 0; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
