The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables that affect the computation are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. 
- `j + 1` will be `2`, since `j` is `1`.
- `k` remains `3`.

Thus, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]`, and it is set to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][3]`.

Other variables (`s` and `m`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][3]`; `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is 1, `m` is unchanged.**
