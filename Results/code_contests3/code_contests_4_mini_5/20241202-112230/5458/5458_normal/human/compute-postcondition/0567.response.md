According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `S`. If `k` is less than or equal to `S`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `S` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. Since `S` is at least 2, it allows for `k` to go up to 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` is 3.**
