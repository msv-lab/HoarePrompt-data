Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, where `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is still at least 2, and `k` is 3.***
