Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 2, and `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
