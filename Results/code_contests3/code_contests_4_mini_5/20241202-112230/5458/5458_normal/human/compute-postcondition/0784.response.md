Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and since `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration.***
