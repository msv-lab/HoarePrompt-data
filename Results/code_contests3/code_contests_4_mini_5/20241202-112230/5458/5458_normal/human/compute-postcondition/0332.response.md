According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `s` and the current value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and the loop is set to iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2. Furthermore, for the loop condition to still hold, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
