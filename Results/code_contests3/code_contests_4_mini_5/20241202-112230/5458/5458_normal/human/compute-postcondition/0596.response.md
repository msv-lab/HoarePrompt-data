Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer, `j` is 5, `i` is 1, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, and `k` is 1 for the loop to execute. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][6][1]` is updated to `dp[0][5][1]`, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
