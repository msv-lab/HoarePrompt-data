The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves updating a specific index in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices for accessing and updating the array.

First, we calculate the affected indices:
- `i + 1 & 1`: This operation evaluates `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`, and then applies the bitwise AND with `1`, resulting in `1 & 1 = 1`. So, the first index is `1`.
- `j + 1`: Here, `j` is `2`, so `j + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
- `k`: The variable `k` remains unchanged and is `2`.

Next, we assess the assignment:
- We are assigning the value of `dp[1][2][2]` (the indices calculated) to `dp[1][3][2]`.

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are not altered by this operation, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value from `dp[1][2][2]`.**
