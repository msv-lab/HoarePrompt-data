Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
