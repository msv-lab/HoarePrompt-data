Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, and for the loop to execute a fourth time `k` must be 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
