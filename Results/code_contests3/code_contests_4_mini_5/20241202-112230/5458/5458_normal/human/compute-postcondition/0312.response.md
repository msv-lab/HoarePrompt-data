Since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, the loop can certainly execute one more time without any adjustments needed to the program state.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is `N^2`, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop for all iterations; the value `dp[N`**
