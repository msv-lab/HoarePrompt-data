The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][3]`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
