According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 4, the loop will execute for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 4, and `k` will be 2 (since `k` starts from 1). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `k` must be 2.**
