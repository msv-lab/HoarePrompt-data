The line `n, m, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user and splits it into three parts, converting each part into an integer. Here, `N`, `M`, and `S` will be assigned the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, respectively. Since `N`, `M`, and `S` are positive integers, the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` will also be positive integers. The previous values of `N`, `M`, and `S` are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is `N^2`, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop for all iterations; the value `dp[N]`**
