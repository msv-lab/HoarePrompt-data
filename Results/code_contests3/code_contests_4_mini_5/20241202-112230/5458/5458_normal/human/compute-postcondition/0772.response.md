Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is now 1, `i` is its final value, `j` is `j_final + 1`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] and remains unchanged at other positions, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
