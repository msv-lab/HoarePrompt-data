The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, `m` is at least 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 2 for the second execution of the loop, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
