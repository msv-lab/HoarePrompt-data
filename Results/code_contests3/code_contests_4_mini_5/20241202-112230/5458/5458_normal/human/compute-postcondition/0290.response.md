According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from `1` to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `1`. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented. Since `k` is currently `1`, it will be incremented to `2` for the next iteration. 

Since `s` is at least `S` (a positive integer), for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least `2` (so that the range still holds).

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
