Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `k` is `S + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`.***
