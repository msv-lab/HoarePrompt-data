The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as is.
