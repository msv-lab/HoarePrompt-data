According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making it 3. 

Additionally, since `s` is at least 2, `k` can take on values up to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 3, as `k` will be 3 in the next iteration. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is `j_final + 2`, with `j_final` less than `m`.**
