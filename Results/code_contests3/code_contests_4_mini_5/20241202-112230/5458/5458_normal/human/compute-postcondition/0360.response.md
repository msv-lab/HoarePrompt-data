The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
