The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `j` is reset to 1, `m` is unchanged; `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][1][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
