According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least `3`, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least `2`, so for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least `3`. Additionally, the variable `k` will increment to `4` during the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `2`, `k` is `4`, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least `3`.**
