Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, and `S` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` does not take effect because `k` exceeds the loop condition. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
