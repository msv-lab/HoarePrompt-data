The code updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` will determine the outcome of this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
