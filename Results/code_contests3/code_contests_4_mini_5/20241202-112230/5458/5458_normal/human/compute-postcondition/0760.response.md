Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is modified at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` but retains the conditions that `s` is at least 4 and `k` is 4.***
