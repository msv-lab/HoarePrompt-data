Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is `m + 1`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3 & 1][m + 2][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, specifically `dp[0][m + 2][2]` is updated with `dp[1][m + 1][1 - m] % mod.`***
