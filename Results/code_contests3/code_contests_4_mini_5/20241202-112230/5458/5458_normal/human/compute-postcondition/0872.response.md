The values of the variables do not change, but the execution will skip the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at the specific indices defined by `i`, `j`, and `k`; `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
