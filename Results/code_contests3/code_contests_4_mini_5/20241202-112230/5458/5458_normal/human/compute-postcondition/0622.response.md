Since the `while` loop is `while 1`, it is an infinite loop that can execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `M + 1`, `k` is `S`, and the output is `dp[n`**.
