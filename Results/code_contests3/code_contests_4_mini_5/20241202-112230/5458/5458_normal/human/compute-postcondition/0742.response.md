Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while the other variables remain unchanged.***
