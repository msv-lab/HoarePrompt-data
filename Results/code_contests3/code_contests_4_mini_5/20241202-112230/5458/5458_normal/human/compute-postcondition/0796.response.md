According to the code, the loop will execute for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. To determine the states required for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1, which ensures that there is at least one iteration. The variable `k` should start at 1 for the first iteration.

However, since the state indicates that `k` is already defined as `s + 1`, it suggests that the loop has not yet executed, and `k` should be adjusted to start from 1.

For the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that after the first execution, `k` should increment correctly. This means `k` would need to be initially set to 1 for the first execution, and it should be able to increment for the second execution. 

The final value of `i` does not directly affect the execution of the loop but indicates the state after previous operations. The variable `j` is also not directly involved in the loop but is noted to check its condition for a different purpose. 

Thus, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `s` must be at least 1.
- `k` should be set to 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
- `j_final` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `j` is `j_final + 2`, and for the loop to execute a second time `j_final` must be less than `m`.**
