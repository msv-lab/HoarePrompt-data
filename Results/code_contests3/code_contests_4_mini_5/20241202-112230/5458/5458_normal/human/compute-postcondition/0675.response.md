According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the condition related to `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value, which is `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to the next value, which would be `s + 1`, and `s` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is `s + 1`**
