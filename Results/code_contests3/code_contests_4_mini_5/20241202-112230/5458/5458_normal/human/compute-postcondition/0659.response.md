Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is updated to `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `s` is greater than `k + 1`, the loop can execute a second time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged and the current iteration of the most internal loop is skipped.***
