The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping any remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is either 3 (if previously it was 2) or 4 (if previously it was 3), `s` is at least 1, `k` is initialized to 1 for the loop to execute, and `j` is greater than `k`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.
