Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2). If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration.***
