The code `continue` is a control flow statement that causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since there are no changes made to the variables or their states by this statement, the output state remains unchanged except for the fact that we are skipping the current iteration of a loop.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
