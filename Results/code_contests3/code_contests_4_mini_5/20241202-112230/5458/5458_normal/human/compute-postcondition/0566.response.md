Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, and `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` with modulo `mod` applied. Additionally, `j` is at least 4, `k` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0.***
