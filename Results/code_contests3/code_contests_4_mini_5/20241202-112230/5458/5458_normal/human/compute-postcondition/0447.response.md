Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the loop does not execute further.***
