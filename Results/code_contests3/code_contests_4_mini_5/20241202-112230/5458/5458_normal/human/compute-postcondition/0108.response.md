According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the expression `n ** 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Since `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` will always be greater than or equal to 1 when `n` is at least 1. Thus, for the loop to execute for a second time, `n` must remain such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2**
