Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the program state.***
