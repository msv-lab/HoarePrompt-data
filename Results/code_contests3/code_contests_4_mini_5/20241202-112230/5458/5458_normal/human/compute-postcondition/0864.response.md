According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, since it iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `s` is the final value of `s`, and `k` is already equal to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute for the first time, `k` should be adjusted to 1, and `s` must be at least 1. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
