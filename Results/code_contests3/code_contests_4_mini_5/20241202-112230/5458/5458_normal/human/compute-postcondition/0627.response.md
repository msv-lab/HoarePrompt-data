According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n ** 2` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 upon the first execution of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute:

1. `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
