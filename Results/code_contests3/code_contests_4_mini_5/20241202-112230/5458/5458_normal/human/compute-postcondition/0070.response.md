The condition checks if `j` (which is 2) is greater than `k` (which is 3). Since `2` is not greater than `3`, the program does not perform any action, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3 and no action is performed.**
