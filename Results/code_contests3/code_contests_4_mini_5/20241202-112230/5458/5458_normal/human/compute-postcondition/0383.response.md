Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is equal to `S`. The dp array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, potentially resulting in multiple indices being set to values derived from previous computations.**
