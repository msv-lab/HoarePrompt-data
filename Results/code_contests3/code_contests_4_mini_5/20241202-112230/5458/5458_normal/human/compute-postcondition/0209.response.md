According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is controlled by `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, continuing until it reaches `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `2`, meaning it has executed at least twice and will increment for the next iteration. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` is also a positive integer.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`. If `i` is at least `2`, we can state that for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `i` is currently at least `2`, we can adjust `i` to be `3` for the next iteration, and we must ensure that `n` is such that `n ** 2` is greater than `3`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `i` is 3, `j` is `M`, `k` is equal to `S`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `j` from `1` to `M` and `k` from `1` to `S`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than `3`.**
