Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `M + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1; `dp[1][M + 2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][M + 1][1]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
