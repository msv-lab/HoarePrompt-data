Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2); `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
