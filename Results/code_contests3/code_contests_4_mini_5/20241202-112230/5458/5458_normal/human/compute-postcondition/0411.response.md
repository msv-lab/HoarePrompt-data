The code snippet `continue` does not alter any variable values directly. It is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. Since the state of all variables remains unchanged, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables without modification. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 3; the `dp` array is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3 (if `j` is 2) or at least 4 (if `j` is 3), `S` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 3 or 4, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 3; the `dp` array is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
