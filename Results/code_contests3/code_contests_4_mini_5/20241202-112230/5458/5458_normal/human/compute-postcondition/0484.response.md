Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `S`, then `dp[1][j + 1][S]` is set to 1 for each `j`; otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` through `dp[1][j + 1][S]` are updated based on previous values of `dp` considering the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The final state of the `dp` array reflects the accumulated values based on the iterations completed.**
