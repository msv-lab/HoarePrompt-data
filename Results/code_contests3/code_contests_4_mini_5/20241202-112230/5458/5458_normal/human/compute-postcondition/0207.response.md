Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `j` is 4, `i` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `S`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now calculated from previous states of `dp` based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
