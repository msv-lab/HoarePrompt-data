Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list updated during the loop execution, where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for `i` equal to 0 and `j` greater than or equal to `k`, and for `i` not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values in the list. The final state of `dp` reflects the results of the computations across all iterations, with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) values that may not all be zero, depending on the conditions met during the loop execution.**
