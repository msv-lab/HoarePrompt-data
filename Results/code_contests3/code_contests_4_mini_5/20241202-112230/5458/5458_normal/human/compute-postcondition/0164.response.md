Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, and for the loop to execute a fourth time `k` must be 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
