Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `S`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][S]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][S - 3] % mod` to it.***
