Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to invalid index access.***
