The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers, `i` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers, `i` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
