Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `dp` has been fully updated based on the iterations of `j` from 1 to `M` and `k` from 1 to `S`, reflecting the computed values according to the conditions in the nested loops.**
