Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 2 and at most `M`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur.**
