According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `S`. The loop iterates from `1` to `S + 1`, which means `S` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `k` starts at `1` before the first iteration of the loop.

For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be incremented to `2` after the first iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer, and `M` and `S` are at least their respective values, the state adjustments needed are:

- `k` should be initialized to `1` at the start of the loop.
- For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be `2` after the first iteration, and `S` must be at least `2` to allow for an additional iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `2`, `k` is `2` for the loop to execute a second time**
