The code assigns the value `1` to the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`, since `i` is `0`. The value of `j + 1` is `2`, and `k` remains `3`. Therefore, the assignment is effectively `dp[1][2][3] = 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3] = 1**
