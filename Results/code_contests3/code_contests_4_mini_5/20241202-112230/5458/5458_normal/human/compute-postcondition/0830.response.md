According to the code, the loop can execute if the variable `m` is at least 1, as the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `m + 1`. The initial values provided are `i` as 2 and `j` as `m + 1`. Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, for the loop to execute at least one time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. 

As a result, the necessary states are:
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), which is acceptable.
- `s` is the final value of `s`, which is acceptable.
- `k` is `s + 1`, which is acceptable.
- `i` is initialized at 2, which is acceptable.
- `j` is initialized at `m + 1`, which means `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should include the condition for `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is the final value of `s`, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1**
