The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the program to skip to the next iteration of the loop it is currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `S`, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `S`, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
