The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the 2D list `dp`. The variable `j` is 1, and `k` is 3, which means `j + 1` equals 2 and `k - j` equals 2. The variable `i` is involved in calculating the index for `dp`, but its current value is not specified. The operation also applies the modulo operation with `mod`. Therefore, the specific value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]`. The states of `dp` are affected, but the exact values after the operation depend on the previous state of `dp` and the value of `mod`.

Since we are not given the specific values for `dp`, only the operation's effect can be described generically. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][1][2] % mod`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is 1, and `m` is unchanged.**
