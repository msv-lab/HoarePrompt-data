The code snippet `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the remaining statements and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state but acknowledges the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
