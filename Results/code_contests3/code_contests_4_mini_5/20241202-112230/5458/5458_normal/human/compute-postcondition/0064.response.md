According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop executes for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased to 3. 

Given that `s` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`). 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be adjusted to 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3.**
