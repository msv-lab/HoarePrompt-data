Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at specific indices based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
