The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
