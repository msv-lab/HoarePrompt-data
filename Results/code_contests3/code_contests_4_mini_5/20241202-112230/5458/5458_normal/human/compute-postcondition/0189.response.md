According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range defined by `1` to `S + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, and since `S` is at least 3, the maximum value of `k` for the loop to execute again must be less than or equal to `S` which must be at least 4. 

In the previous iteration, `k` would have been set to 1, and as the loop progresses, `k` will increment by 1 in each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should now be 2, and the loop will continue until `k` reaches `S + 1`.

Thus, the state must be adjusted to reflect that the loop will execute for the next value of `k`, which is 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
