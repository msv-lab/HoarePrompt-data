The code assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will result in either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is initially `2`, the calculation is as follows: `2 + 1 = 3`, and in binary, `3` is `11`, so `3 & 1` equals `1`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`.

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the only affected variable is `dp`, which is updated. The exact values of `j` and `k` are not given, but since `k` is `S + 1`, it will be a positive integer greater than or equal to `3`.

Output State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers; `i` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is 1; `k` is `S + 1`**
