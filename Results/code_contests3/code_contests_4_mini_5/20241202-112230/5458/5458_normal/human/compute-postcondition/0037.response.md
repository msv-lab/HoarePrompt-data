The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` involves updating the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

First, we need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1`. Given that `i` is 0, this results in `0 + 1 & 1` which evaluates to `1 & 1`, yielding `1`. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` equals `1`.

Next, we evaluate `j + 1`, where `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals `2`.

Then, we have `k`, which remains as `3`. 

The relevant indices for the `dp` array are now identified: `dp[1][2][3]`.

The right side of the equation is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, which translates to `dp[1][1][3] % mod`. The specific value of `mod` is not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can state that `dp[1][1][3]` will be calculated modulo `mod`.

Since there are no changes to the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, or `k`, the output state will reflect only what has been calculated concerning the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3] % mod**.
