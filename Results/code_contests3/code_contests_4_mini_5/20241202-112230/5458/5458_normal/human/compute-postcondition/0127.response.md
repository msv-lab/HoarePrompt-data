The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 2, `k` is currently 2, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is at least 2, `k` is currently 2, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
