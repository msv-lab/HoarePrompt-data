The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, `i` is `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. `j` is `3`, so `j + 1` evaluates to `4`. The variable `k` holds the value of `S`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, we are setting `dp[1][4][S] = 1`. The previous values of the other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is `S`, and `dp[1][4][S] = 1`.**
