Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, `m` is at least 3, `j` is at least 4, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1.***
