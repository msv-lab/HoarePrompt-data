The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are not specifically known from the initial state, but the operation indicates that the `k` must be valid, meaning `k` must be at least `j` for `k - j` to be a non-negative index. Therefore, the output state describes the update operation taking place while maintaining the conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
