According to the code, the for loop will execute based on the value of `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`, which means `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given that `S` is greater than or equal to 2, we can assert that `s` is at least 2, allowing the loop to run at least once.

The current states are:
- `N` is greater than or equal to 1 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `M` is a positive integer (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `S` is greater than or equal to 2 (this ensures that `s` can be at least 2).
- `i` is 2 (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `j` is `M + 1` (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

The loop variable `k` will start at 1 and go up to `s + 1`. Since `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` can be at least 2 (but I cannot directly reference `s` without knowing its exact value). 

For the loop to execute, the variable `k` will start at 1. Therefore, if `s` is at least 2 (which it is, as given), `k` will take the values 1 and 2 during its first iterations. 

Thus, the states can be summarized as:
State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `M + 1, for the loop to execute, `s` is at least 2 and `k` is 1 on the first iteration**.
