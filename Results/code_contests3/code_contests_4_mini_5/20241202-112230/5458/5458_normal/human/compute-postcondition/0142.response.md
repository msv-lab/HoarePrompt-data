According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `M`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2, and `M` is at least 2, which means the loop has started its iterations. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to at least 3. Additionally, the value of `M` must still allow for this increment, meaning `M` must be at least 3 in order to allow `j` to reach this value.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is equal to `S`.**
