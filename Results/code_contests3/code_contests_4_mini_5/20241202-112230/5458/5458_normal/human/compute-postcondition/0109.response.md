According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `M`. The loop will execute for each integer `j` in the range from 1 to `M`. Currently, `M` is a positive integer, which means the loop can potentially execute. Given that `i` is set to 2, this suggests that the loop has already executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2 on the second iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration. Since `M` is a positive integer, as long as `M` is at least 2, the loop will execute a second time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 2.**
