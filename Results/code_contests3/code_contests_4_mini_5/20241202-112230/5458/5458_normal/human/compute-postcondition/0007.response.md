According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n ** 2` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which implies that `n ** 2` will be at least 1. The variable `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
