Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][1]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
