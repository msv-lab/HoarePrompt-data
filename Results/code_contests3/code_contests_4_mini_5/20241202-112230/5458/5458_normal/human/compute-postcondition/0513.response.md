Postcondition: ***If `j` is greater than `k`, then the program continues with the next iteration without changing any variable values. Otherwise, the condition of `j` not being greater than `k` has no else part to specify further actions. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and `k` remain unchanged, where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 4, and `k` is 4.***
