The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the nearest loop. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variable values, and we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 5, `S` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is either 5 or 6, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
