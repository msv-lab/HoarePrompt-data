The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into the `dp` list. 

1. The value of `i` is `2`, so `i + 1` equals `3`. 
2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`. The binary representation of `3` is `11`, and `1` is `01`, so `3 & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
3. The value of `j` is `m + 1`, which is not explicitly defined but can be treated as a specific value (let's denote it as `j`).
4. We now calculate `j + 1`, which equals `m + 2`.
5. The value of `k` is `3`.

Now we have the following indices for `dp`:
- The first index becomes `1` (from `i + 1 & 1`).
- The second index becomes `m + 2` (from `j + 1`).
- The third index remains `3` (value of `k`).

The assignment `dp[1][m + 2][3]` takes the value from `dp[1][m + 1][3]`.

The other variables (`dp`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j`) do not change directly due to this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` now equals `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 3.**
