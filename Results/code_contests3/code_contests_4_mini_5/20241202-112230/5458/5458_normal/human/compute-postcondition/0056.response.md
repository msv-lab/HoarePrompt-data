The variable `dp` is being modified at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial values, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. 

1. Calculate `i + 1 & 1`: 
   - `i + 1` is `0 + 1`, which is `1`. 
   - `1 & 1` results in `1`.
   
2. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j + 1` is `2 + 1`, which is `3`. 

3. Therefore, the indices being accessed for the `dp` array are `[1][3][2]`.

The value at this index is set to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.**
