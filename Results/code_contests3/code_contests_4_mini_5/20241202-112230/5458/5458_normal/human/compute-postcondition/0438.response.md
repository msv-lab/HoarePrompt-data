Postcondition: ***`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers, `i` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop will not proceed to the next iteration, and the program's state remains unchanged for this iteration.***
