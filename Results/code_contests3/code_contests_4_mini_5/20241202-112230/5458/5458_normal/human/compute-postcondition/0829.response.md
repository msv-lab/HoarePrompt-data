According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `n ** 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

So, `i` will become 2. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is still less than `n ** 2`. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is the final value of `s`, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `dp[1][j + 1][s + 1]` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop for all values of j from 1 to m and k from 1 to s.**
