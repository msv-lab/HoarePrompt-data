According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `s + 1`, which means `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `S` is at least 3, `s` can be at least 3, which satisfies this condition.

However, we also need to ensure that the variable `k` is properly initialized before the loop starts. Since `k` is set to equal `S` before the loop, it will be 3 or greater at the start of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
1. `s` must be at least 1 (which it is, since `S` is at least 3).
2. `k` will take the values from 1 to `s + 1` during the loop execution.

Thus, at the start of the loop:
- `k` is initialized based on the loop, but it will start with 1 in the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 3, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 4, `k` is equal to `S`, `dp` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 3 and `k` will start at 1 during the loop execution**
