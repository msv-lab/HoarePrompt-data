The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 4, `j` is 5, `k` is 5, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is greater than 4, `S` is at least 4, `j` is 5, `k` is 5, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
