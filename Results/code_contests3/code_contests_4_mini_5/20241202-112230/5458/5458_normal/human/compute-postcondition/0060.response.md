Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value from `dp[1][2][2]`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[1][3][2]`.***
