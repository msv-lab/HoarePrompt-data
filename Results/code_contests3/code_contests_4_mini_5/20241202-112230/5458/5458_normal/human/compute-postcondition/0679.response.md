The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated with `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k` where `k` is `s + 1` and `s >= 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
