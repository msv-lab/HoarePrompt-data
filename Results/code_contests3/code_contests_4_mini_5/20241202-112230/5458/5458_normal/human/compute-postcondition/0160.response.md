The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in its current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, for the loop to execute a fourth time `k` must be 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
