The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variable `k` is defined as `S + 1`, and since `j` is at least `S`, `k - j` will be a non-negative integer. The current state of the affected variables is not explicitly stated, but we know that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be modified based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `N`, `M`, `S`, or the contents of the `dp` array, we can summarize the output state based on the operation performed:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least `M`, `S` is at least `S`, `k` is `S + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.**
