According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1. The variable `k` will start at 1 for the first iteration. Since `dp` is already initialized, it doesn't need adjustment for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1**
