The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Here, `i` is `0`, `j` is `3`, and `k` is `1`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in `0 + 1 & 1`, which evaluates to `1`. Therefore, the index for the first dimension of `dp` is `1`, while `j + 1` gives `4` and `k` remains `1`. 

The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1] = 1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1] = 1**
