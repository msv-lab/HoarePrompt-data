According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, which means it will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is `S + 1`, which indicates that `k` is currently greater than `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `k` to be equal to `1` instead.

State: **`N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `S`.**
