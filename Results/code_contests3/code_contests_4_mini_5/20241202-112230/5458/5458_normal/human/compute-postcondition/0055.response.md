According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `S`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 2. 

Since `S` is a positive integer and `k` is currently 1, the loop can execute one more time if `S` is at least 2. Thus, `k` will be updated to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `S` must be at least 2.**
