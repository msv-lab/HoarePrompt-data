Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the structure of `dp`. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which may depend on the condition of `j` relative to `k`.***
