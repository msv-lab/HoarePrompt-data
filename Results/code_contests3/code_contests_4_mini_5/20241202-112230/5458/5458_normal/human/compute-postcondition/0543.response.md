According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, starting from 1 and going up to `s`. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be within the range defined by `1` to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, which is out of the defined range for the loop.

Since the range for `k` is from `1` to `s`, and `s` is at least 3, this means there will be no valid value for `k` that allows the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the next state will reflect that the loop can no longer continue. The value of `k` has reached its upper limit, and no further iterations can be performed.

State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, but `k` is now `s + 1`**
