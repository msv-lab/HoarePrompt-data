The values of the variables do not change, but we continue the loop, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration and moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 3, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
