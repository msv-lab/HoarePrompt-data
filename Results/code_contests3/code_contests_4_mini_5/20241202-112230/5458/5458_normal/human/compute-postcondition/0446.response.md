The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `M`, `S` are positive integers where `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
