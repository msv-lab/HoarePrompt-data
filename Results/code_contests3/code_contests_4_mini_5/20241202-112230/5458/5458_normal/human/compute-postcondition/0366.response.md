The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a 3-dimensional array `dp`. The indices are computed as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1`: The value of `i` is either `0` or `1`. Thus, `i + 1` can be `1` or `2`. Applying the bitwise AND operation with `1`:
  - If `i` is `0`, then `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` is `1`.
  - If `i` is `1`, then `i + 1` is `2`, and `2 & 1` is `0`.

  Therefore, the result of `i + 1 & 1` can be `0` or `1`.

- `j + 1`: The value of `j` is either `2` or `3`. Therefore, `j + 1` can be `3` or `4`.

- `k`: The value of `k` is `2`, so this index remains constant.

Thus, the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the specific positions in the `dp` array as follows:

- If `i = 0`, then `dp[1][3][2] = 1` and `dp[1][4][2] = 1`.
- If `i = 1`, then `dp[0][3][2] = 1` and `dp[0][4][2] = 1`.

The other variables (`N`, `M`, `S`, `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2 or 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated at specific indices based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
