According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit set by `S`. If `k` is less than or equal to `S`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be 2 for the loop to execute a fourth time, and `S` is at least 4. 

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `S`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased by 1, making it 3. Thus, for the loop to execute a fifth time, `S` must be at least 4 (which it is), and `k` must be 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 4, for the loop to execute a fifth time `k` must be 3.**
