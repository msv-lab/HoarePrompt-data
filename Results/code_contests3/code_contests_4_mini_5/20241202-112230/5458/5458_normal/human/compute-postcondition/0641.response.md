Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 when `s >= 1`, `k = 1`, and `j >= k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
