The statement `continue` does not change any variable values, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is inside and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables remain unchanged, the output state reflects that no updates were made, but indicates the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions 2 by (M + 2), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
