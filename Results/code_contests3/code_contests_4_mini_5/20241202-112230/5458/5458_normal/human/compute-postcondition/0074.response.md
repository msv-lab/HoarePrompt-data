According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `M`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `M` is at least 2, which means the loop has executed for the values of `j` from 1 to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and for the loop to execute again, `M` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is at least 3, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is `S`.**
