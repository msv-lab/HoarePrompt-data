The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
