Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 3, `S` is at least 2, `S` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated based on the iterations of `k` from 1 to `S`, and for the loop to execute a third time `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
