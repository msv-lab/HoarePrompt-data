The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one element of the 2D list `dp` to another. The index `i + 1 & 1` calculates the current index based on the value of `i`, while `j + 1` increases the index of `j` by 1. The value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` comes from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Since `dp` is a 2D list initialized with zeros, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is initially 0. Therefore, after this assignment, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will also be 0, and the states of other variables are not affected. 

Thus, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 0 (equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`).

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list initialized with dimensions 2 by (M + 2) and each inner list containing (S + 1) zeros; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now 0 (equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`)**.
