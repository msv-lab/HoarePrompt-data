The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `M` is at least 1, `S` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
