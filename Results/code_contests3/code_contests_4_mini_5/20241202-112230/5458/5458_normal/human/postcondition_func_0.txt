The function processes multiple datasets of three positive integers N, M, and S, where N ranges from 1 to 7, M from 1 to 2000, and S from 1 to 3000. It continues processing datasets until the input "0 0 0" is encountered. For each dataset, it computes a value based on a dynamic programming approach and prints the result, which is derived from a 3D list `dp`. The final printed result for each dataset is `dp[N^2 & 1][M + 1][S] % 100000`. The function does not handle cases where the input does not fall within the specified ranges or if the input is malformed, as it relies on valid input as per the constraints mentioned.
