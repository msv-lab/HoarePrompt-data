The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
