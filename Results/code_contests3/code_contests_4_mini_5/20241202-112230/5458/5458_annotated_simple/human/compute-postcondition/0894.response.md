Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][4]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][4]` is updated based on `dp[0][2][2] % mod.***
