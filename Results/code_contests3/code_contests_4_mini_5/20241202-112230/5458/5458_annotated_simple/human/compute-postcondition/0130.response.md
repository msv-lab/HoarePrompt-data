Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7); `i` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`; `j` is updated to 3; `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
