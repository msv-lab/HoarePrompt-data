Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5, and `m` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program skips the rest of the current loop iteration while the state of `dp` remains unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program continues executing in the loop as normal.***
