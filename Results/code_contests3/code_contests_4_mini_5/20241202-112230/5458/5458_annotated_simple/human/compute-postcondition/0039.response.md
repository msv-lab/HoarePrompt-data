Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, provided `j` is not greater than `k`.***
