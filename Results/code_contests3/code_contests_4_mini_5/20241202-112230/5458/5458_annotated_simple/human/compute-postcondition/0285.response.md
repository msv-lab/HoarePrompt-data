The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop it is in. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with a note that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 (with values from 1 to `s` inclusive), `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
