The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The values of `N`, `k`, `s`, `j`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
