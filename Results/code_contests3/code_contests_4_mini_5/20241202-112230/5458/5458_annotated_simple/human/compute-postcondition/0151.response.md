The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is reset to 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
