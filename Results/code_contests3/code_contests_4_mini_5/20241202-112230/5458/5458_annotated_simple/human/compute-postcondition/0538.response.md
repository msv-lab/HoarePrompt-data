The values of the variables do not change, but we execute a `continue` statement which skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
