Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is such that `j <= m - 1`, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `s` is at least 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
