According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 2. This indicates that for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented.

Since `k` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be increased to 2. Additionally, the condition for the loop to continue is that `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Thus, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to run again with `k` being 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
