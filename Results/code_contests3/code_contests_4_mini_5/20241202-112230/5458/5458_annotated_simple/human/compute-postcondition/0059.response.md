The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
