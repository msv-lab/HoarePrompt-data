According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3.**
