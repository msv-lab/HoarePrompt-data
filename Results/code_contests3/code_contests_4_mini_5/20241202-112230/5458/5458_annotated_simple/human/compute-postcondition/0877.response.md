According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must increase by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3, and `s` must be at least 3 to allow `k` to take this value.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
