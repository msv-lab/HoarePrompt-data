Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been updated, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the conditions stated above hold true. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][1] % mod,` while maintaining the other conditions.***
