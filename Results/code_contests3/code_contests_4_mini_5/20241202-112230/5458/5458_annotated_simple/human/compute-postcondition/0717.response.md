According to the code, the loop is set to execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, which is at least 2. The current state shows that `k` is 2 at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3, and since `s` is at least 2, `k` cannot exceed `s`. 

Therefore, if the loop is to execute one more time, `k` must be 3, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop cannot execute again as `k` cannot exceed `s`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time.**
