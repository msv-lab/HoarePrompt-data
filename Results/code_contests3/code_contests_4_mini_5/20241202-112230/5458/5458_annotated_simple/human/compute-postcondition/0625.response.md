Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `i` is `N^2 - 1`; `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000); `j` is equal to `m + 1`; `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000); `k` is equal to `s + 1`. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if they are not all zero, no changes occur in the values of `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, or `k`.***
