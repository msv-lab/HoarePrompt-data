Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
