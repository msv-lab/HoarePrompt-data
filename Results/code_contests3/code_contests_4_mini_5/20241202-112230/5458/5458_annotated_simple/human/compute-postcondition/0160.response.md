The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
