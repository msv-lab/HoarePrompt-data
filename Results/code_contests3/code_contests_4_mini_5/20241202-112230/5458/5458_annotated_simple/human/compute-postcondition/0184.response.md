The statement `continue` does not alter the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the values of `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 5, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
