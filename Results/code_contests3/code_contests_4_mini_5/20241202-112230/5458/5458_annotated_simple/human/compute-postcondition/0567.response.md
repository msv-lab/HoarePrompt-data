According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is reset to 1, and since `s` is at least `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must still be at least 2 (since `k` should be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
