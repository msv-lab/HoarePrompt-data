According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, since `k` is 2, the next value of `k` will be 3. The loop can only continue executing if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
