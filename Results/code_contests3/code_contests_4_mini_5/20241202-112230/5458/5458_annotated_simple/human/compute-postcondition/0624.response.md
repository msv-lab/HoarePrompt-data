The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `i` is `N^2 - 1`; `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000); `j` is equal to `m + 1`; `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000); `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
