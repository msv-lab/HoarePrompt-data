In the given code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. 

The following steps are taken into consideration:
1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` is evaluated. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. The bitwise AND operation between `1` and `1` gives `1`. Thus, the first index for `dp` becomes `1`.
   
2. The second index `j + 1` is calculated. Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `k` is `5`, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` from the provided information, but it will be at least `5` or more. Therefore, `j + 1` will be at least `6`.

3. The third index is `k`, which is `5`.

Putting it all together, we can summarize the changes:
- The array `dp[1][j + 1][5]` is set to `1`, where `j + 1` is at least `6`.

The current values of the other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `k`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 5, and `dp[1][j + 1][5]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 5, and `dp[1][j + 1][5]` is set to 1.**
