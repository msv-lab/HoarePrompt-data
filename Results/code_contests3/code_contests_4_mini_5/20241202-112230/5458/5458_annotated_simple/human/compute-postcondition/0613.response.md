The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `m` is at least 3; `dp[1][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
