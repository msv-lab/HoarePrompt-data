Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `i` is not equal to 0, if `j` is greater than `k` (which is not the case since 3 is not greater than 3), then `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Since there is no else part, the program state remains unchanged if the condition is not met.***
