The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the current code snippet, the values of the variables do not change. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, noting that we are prepared to continue in the loop if there was one.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 3; dp[1][4][2] is assigned the value of dp[1][3][2] and we are prepared to continue in the loop.**
