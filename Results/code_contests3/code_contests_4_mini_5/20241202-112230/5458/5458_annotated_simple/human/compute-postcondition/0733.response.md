The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` impacts the `dp` array at the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
2. `j` is currently 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
3. `k` is currently 2.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][3][2]` to `1`. The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.**
