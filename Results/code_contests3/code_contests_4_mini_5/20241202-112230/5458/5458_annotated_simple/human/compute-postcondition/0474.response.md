Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0, then `dp[0][4][2]` is assigned the value 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[0][4][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][3][-1] % mod`, and the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop is skipped.***
