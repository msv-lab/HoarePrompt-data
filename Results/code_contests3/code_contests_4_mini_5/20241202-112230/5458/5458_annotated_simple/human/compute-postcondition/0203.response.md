Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 6), and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][6]` is set to `dp[1][j][6]`, allowing the loop to continue to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur.***
