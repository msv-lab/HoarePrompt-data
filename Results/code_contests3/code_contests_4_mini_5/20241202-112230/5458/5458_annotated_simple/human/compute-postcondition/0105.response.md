Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
