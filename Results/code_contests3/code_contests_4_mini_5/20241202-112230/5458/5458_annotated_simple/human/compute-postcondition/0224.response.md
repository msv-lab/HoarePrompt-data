According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop is designed to iterate from `1` to `s`, meaning it will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:
- `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7).
- If `i` is at least `N + 1`, then `k` is equal to `s` (the maximum value for `k` in the current iteration).

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will be `s + 1`. However, since `k` iterates only up to `s`, the loop cannot execute again if `k` is already at `s`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `N + 1` so that there is a valid next value for `k`. 

If `k` is currently `s`, the next value for `k` would ideally need to be `s + 1`, and `s` must be such that it allows for this increment.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be at least `N + 1`, and `k` is `s + 1`**.
