Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `k` is `s + 1`, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. In the else scenario, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`**
