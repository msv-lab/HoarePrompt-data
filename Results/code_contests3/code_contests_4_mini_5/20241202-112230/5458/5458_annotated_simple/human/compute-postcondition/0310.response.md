Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `j` and `k`, with `dp[1][M + 1][S]` reflecting the final state after all iterations of the loop.**
