According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to or less than `m`.

Since `j` has been incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`. Hence, for the loop to execute again, `j + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

Moreover, since `k` is equal to `s` and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the value of `k` will remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
