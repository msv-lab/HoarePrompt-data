Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is an integer. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
