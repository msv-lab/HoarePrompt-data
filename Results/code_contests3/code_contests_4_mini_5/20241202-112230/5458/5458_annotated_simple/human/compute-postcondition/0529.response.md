The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][1]` while we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
