The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `dp` array, and since `j` is less than or equal to `m - 1` and `k` is 2, the assignment can take place if `j` is greater than `k`. 

The state of `dp` is modified, but the specific values of `dp` and `mod` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment operation without exact values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
