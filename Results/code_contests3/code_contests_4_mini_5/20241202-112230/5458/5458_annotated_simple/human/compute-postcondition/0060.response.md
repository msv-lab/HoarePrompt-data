Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the rest of the current loop iteration is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop continues to execute.***
