The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array. The values being indexed are:

- `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is 1, this results in `1 + 1 & 1 = 2 & 1 = 0`. 
- `j + 1`: Since `j` is 3, this results in `3 + 1 = 4`.
- `k`: The value of `k` is 3.

Given this, the assignment becomes `dp[0][4][3] = 1`. This indicates that the value at the specific index of the `dp` array is being set to 1. The other variables are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `dp[0][4][3]` is set to 1**.
