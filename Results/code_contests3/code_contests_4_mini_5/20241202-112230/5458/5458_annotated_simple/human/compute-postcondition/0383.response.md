Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions of the loop, where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` reflects the calculations based on the previous iterations and conditions applied within the loop.**
