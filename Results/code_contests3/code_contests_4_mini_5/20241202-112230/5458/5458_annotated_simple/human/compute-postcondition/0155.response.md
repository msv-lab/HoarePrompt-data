Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is reset to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][4][k - 4] % mod`.***
