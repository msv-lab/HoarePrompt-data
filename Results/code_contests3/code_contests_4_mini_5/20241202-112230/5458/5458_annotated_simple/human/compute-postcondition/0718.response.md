The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a 3-dimensional array `dp`. The first index `i + 1 & 1` will determine whether `i` is 0 or 1:

- If `i` is 0: `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` is 1.
- If `i` is 1: `i + 1` is 2, and `2 & 1` is 0.

The second index `j + 1` is always `4`, since `j` is 3. The third index `k` is 3. 

Thus, the expression will update either `dp[1][4][3] = 1` if `i` is 0 or `dp[0][4][3] = 1` if `i` is 1. Other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 3; `k` is 3; and `dp` is updated at either `dp[1][4][3]` or `dp[0][4][3]` to 1 based on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is 3; `k` is 3; and `dp` is updated at either `dp[1][4][3]` or `dp[0][4][3]` to 1 based on the value of `i`.**
