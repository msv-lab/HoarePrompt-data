Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `k`, or `j`.***
