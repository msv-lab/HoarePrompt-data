Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2, `j` is an integer greater than 2, and `k` is 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
