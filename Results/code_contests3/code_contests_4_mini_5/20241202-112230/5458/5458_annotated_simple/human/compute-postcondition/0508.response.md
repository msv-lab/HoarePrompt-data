According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 4, and since `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again, `k` must increase by 1. Thus, `k` will be 5 in the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, `s` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5**
