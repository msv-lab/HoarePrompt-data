The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is within and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
