Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), M (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), and S (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), and for each dataset, it calculates a value stored in a dynamic programming table based on the inputs, printing the result modulo 100000. The function continues to process datasets until it encounters a dataset with N, M, and S all equal to 0, at which point it stops execution. The output behavior is specified as printing the computed value for each dataset. **
