Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least `N + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; otherwise, no changes occur.**
