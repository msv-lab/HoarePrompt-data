Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), and `j` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
