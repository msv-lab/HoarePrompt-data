The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters as it is defined without any input arguments. Instead, it processes multiple datasets, where each dataset consists of three positive integers: `N`, `M`, and `S`, with constraints specified as follows: `N` must be between 1 and 7, `M` must be between 1 and 2000, and `S` must be between 1 and 3000. The function continues to process datasets until it encounters a dataset where `N`, `M`, and `S` are all zero, at which point it stops. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so it is unclear what the function returns or how it processes the datasets. However, it is implied that it handles multiple datasets, possibly performing operations based on the values of `N`, `M`, and `S`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), M (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), and S (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), stopping when a dataset with N, M, S as 0 is encountered. The output behavior is not specified.**
