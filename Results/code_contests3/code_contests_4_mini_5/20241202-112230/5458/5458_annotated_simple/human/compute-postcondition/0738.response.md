The code `continue` does not modify any variable values. Instead, it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration, if applicable. Since there is no indication of a loop context provided, we can only state that the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
