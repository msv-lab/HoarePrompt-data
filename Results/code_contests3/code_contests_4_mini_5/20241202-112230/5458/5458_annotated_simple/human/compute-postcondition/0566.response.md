Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least `s`, and `k` is reset to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][1] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
