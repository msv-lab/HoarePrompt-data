The code `continue` does not change any values of the variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop it is in. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop is executed again without any changes to the variable states.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
