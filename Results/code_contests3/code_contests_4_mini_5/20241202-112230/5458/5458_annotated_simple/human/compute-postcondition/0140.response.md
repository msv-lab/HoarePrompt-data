Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, then `i` is incremented by 1, `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is equal to 2, `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is equal to 4. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][4]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
