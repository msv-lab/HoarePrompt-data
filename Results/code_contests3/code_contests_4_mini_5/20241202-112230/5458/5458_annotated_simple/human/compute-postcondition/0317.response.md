According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which will iterate from 0 to \( n^2 - 1 \). The value of `n` is given as a positive integer within the range from 1 to 7. This implies that \( n^2 \) will range from 1 to 49. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as \( n \) is at least 1.

Since `i` is initialized at 0 before the loop starts, it will take its first value as 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be 0, and `n` should be a positive integer (which is already given).

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
