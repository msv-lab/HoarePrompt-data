According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, inclusive of the start (1) and exclusive of the end (`s + 1`). The loop variable `k` will take on values from 1 up to `s`. 

For the loop to execute a third time, `k` must take on the values 1, 2, and 3. This implies that `s` must be at least 3, as the range of `k` is determined by the value of `s`. 

In the provided state, `s` is at least 2. To ensure that the loop can execute a third time, `s` must be adjusted to be at least 3. The values of `i` and `j` are irrelevant to the execution of the loop, and `N` does not impact it either.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- Set `s` to be at least 3 (to allow for `k` to take on the value of 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s` for the loop to execute a third time.**
