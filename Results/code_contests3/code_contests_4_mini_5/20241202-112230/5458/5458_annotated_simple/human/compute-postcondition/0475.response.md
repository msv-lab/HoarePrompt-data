According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 3. This indicates that the loop can execute again since `k` can take on the next value, which is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will be 3. Also, since `s` is at least 3, the loop can continue executing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3**
