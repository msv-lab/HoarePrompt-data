Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
