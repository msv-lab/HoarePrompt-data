The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remaining iterations of the current loop or statement we were within. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or statement.
