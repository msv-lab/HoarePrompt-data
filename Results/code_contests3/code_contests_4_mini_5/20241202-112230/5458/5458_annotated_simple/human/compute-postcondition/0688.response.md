The code `continue` does not change the values of the variables directly, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest loop and proceed to the next iteration. The variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged in their current state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 4, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
