Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is `N^2 - 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s`, and the `dp` array has been fully updated reflecting all applicable conditions based on the nested loop evaluations, with `dp[1][m + 1][s]` containing values derived from the computations modulo `mod`.**
