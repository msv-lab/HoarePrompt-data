According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop will execute for the first time with `k` starting at 1. For the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3, allowing for `k` to take the values 1, 2, and 3.

At the beginning of the loop:
- On the first iteration, `k` is 1.
- On the second iteration, `k` is 2.
- On the third iteration, `k` is 3.

Since `N`, `i`, and `j` are not directly relevant to the loop execution, their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. The states that need to be adjusted are `s` to ensure it is at least 3 and `k` starting at 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3**
