Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3 & 1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][2][2] % mod`, and `dp[3][3][2]` is incremented by `dp[0][2][0] % mod`.***
