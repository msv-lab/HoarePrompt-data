Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2 after the first iteration. If `i` is 0, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time and at least 2 for it to execute a second time; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1, then `dp[0][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][2][0] % mod`.***
