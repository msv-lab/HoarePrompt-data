Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then a value of 1 is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][4]`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][4]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][2][2] % mod`.***
