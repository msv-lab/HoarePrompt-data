The code `continue` does not alter any variable values but instead skips the current iteration of the loop in which it resides. Therefore, the values of `N`, `k`, `j`, and the `dp` array remain unchanged. The output state should reflect that we are continuing the loop without impacting the current variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); `k` is 2; `j` is greater than or equal to `k` if `i` is 0, or `j` is greater than `k` if `i` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue the loop.**
