The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the current context. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
