According to the code, the loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, but since `k` cannot exceed `s`, it will not execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state for the loop to execute for the next value of `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be set to `s + 1`. However, since `k` can only range from 1 to `s`, the loop cannot run again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `k` is `s + 1`, and `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
