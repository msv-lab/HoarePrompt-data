The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
