Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, and `k` is `s + 2` with `k` being less than or equal to `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
