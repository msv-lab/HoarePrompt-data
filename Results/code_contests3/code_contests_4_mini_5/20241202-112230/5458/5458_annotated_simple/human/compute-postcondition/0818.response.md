According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1.

Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, the next value for `k` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is such that `j <= m - 1`, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3.**
