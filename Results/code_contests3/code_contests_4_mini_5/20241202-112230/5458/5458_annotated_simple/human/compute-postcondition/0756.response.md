The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
