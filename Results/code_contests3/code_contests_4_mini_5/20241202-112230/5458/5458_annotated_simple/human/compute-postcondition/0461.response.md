The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the block we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is not greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement in the block.
