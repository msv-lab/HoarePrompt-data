The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
