Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i == 0` holds true and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
