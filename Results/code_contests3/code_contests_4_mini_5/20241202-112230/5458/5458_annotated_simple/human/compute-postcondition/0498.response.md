Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, then `j` is updated to 5, `s` is at least 3, and `dp[1][5][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, then `j` remains 4, `s` is at least 3, and an operation on `dp` was attempted, which may lead to an out-of-bounds access with `dp[1][4][-2]`.***
