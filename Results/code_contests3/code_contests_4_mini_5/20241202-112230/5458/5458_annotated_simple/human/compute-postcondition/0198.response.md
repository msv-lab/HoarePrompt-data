According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 5 and `s` must be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, `k` will increment by 1, so the next value of `k` will be 6.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 6, and `k` is 6**
