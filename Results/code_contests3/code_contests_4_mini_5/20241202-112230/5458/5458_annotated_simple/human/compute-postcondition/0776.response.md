According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 2**
