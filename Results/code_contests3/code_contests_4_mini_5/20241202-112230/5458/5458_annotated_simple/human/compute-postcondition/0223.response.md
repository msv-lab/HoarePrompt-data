Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, then `j` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 where `j + 1` is at least 2 and `k` is at least `N`. Otherwise, if `i` is at least `N + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
