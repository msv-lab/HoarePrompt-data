Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `dp` has been fully updated, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` starts at 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[1][1][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
