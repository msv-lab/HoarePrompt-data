According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` relative to `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to run again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3.**
