In the given code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multidimensional list or array `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices.

- The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1` equals 2. The expression `2 & 1` results in 0, as the bitwise AND operation between 2 (binary `10`) and 1 (binary `01`) yields 0. Therefore, the first index in `dp` becomes 0.
- The value of `j` is 3, so `j + 1` equals 4. The second index in `dp` thus becomes 4.
- The value of `k` is 2, which remains unchanged and is the third index in `dp`.

Thus, the line effectively assigns the value `1` to `dp[0][4][2]`.

The other variables `N`, `s`, and any prior values in `dp` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2; `dp[0][4][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
