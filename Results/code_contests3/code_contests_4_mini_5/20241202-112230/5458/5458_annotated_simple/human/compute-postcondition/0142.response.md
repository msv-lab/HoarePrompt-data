According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop executes while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 3. Since `m` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 4. This means for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4 (so that the condition `j <= m` holds true).

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `j` is incremented to 4, and that `m` is at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is incremented to at least 3, `m` is at least 4 for the loop to execute, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute, and `k` is equal to 5. The `dp` array has been updated based on the conditions within the loop for all iterations.**
