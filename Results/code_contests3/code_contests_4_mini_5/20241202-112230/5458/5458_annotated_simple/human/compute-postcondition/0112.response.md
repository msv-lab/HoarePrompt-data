Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is `i + 1`, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` equals 0, `k` is 1 on the first iteration and 2 on the second iteration, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
