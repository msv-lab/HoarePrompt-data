According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Since `s` is at least 4, the loop can execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4.**
