Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been updated at either dp[1][3][3] = 1 or dp[0][3][3] = 1, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the conditions stated above hold true.***
