Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[1][j][k]`, and the loop will skip to the next iteration. Otherwise, the loop will not execute the body again, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
