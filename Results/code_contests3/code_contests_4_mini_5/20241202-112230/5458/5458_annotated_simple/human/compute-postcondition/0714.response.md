The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given as either 0 or 1, 3, and 2 respectively. Since `j` is 3 and `k` is 2, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` translates to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` translates to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]`. 

However, since we do not have the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` or `mod`, we cannot determine the exact output values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]`. We can only state that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` modulo `mod`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2] % mod`.
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2] % mod.**
