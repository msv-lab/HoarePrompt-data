The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5, `m` is at least 3, and the state of `dp` remains unchanged, while we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
