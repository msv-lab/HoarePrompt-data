Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at either `dp[1][4][3]` or `dp[0][4][3]` to 1 based on the value of `i`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][3][0] % mod`.***
