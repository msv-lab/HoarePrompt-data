Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 1 on the first iteration and 2 on the second iteration. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
