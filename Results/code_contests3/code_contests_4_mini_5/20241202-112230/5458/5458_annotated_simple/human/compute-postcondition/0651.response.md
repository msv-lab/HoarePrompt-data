According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop runs for `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. If `s` is defined, then for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and if `i` is 1, `k` is currently at its value from the last iteration. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `s + 1`, we need to adjust `k` to be one greater than its current value.

Thus, if `k` is currently at its maximum (i.e., `s`), then the loop will not execute again. However, if `k` is less than `s`, it can proceed to the next value.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is defined or not defined, `k` is the next value to be processed (which is currently `k + 1`), for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
