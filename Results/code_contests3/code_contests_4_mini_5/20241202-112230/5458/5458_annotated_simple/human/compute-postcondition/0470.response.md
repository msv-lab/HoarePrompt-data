The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. However, in this context, no loop is provided in the code snippet, which means that the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2; `dp[0][4][2]` is set to the value of `dp[0][3][2]`, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.
