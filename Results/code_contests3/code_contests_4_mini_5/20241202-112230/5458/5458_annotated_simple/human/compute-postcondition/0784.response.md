Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7) and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, affecting the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
