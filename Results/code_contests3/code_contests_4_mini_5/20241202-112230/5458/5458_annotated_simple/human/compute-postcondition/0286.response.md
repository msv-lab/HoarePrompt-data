Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1 (with values from 1 to `s` inclusive), `j` is greater than `k`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
