According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `m` is at least 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 5. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 5. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 5, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is equal to `s`.**
