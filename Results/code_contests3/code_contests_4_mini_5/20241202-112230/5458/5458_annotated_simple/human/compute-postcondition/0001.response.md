According to the code, the loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it is an infinite loop that will always execute regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one time or more.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), and `mod` is 100000**.
