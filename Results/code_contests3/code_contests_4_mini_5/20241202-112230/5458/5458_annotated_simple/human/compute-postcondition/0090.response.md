Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables.***
