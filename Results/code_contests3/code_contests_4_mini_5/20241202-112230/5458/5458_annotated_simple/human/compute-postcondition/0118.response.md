The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is either 1 or 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
