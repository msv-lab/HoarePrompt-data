According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 and going up to `s`. For the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3 so that `k` can take on the values 1, 2, and 3.

Before the loop starts, `N` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is at least 1. However, the value of `s` is not defined in the provided state, which is critical for the loop execution.

To ensure the loop executes at least three times, we must set `s` to be at least 3. The current state of `k` being 1 indicates that it is correctly initialized for the first iteration, and we also need to note that `k` will increment with each iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute at least three times `s` must be at least 3.**
