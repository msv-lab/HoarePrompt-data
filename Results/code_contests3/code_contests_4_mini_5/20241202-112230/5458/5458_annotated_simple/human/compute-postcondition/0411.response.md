The code `continue` is a control flow statement that does not change any variable values but will skip the rest of the current iteration in the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been updated, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
