The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. The conditions stated in the initial state remain intact.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` (3 > 3), and `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
