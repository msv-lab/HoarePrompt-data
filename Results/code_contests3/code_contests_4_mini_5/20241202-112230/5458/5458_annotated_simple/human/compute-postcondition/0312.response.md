Since the `while` loop is a `while 1` loop (an infinite loop), it can execute indefinitely without any conditions that would terminate it. Therefore, no state adjustments are necessary to allow for another iteration of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `dp[1][M + 1][S]` reflects the final state after all iterations of the loop, and the value printed is `dp[n`**
