The code assigns the value of `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes to `1` since `i` is `0`, which means the index `i + 1` becomes `1` and the bitwise AND with `1` results in `1`. The value of `j + 1` becomes `3` since `j` is `2`, and the value of `k` remains as it is, so it is assigned to whatever value it has.

Thus, the `dp` array will have `1` placed at the position `[1][3][k]`. The other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
