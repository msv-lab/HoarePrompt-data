The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`. The value of `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. The value of `k` is `2`. Thus, the assignment modifies the `dp` array at the index `dp[1][3][2]` to `1`. The states of the other variables do not change.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `i` is equal to 0; `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
