Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
