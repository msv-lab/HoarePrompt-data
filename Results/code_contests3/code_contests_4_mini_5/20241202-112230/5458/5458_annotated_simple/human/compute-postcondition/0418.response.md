According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7. Therefore, `n ** 2` must be greater than 0 since `N` is at least 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` is currently 0, it will become 1 for the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n ** 2` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
