According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range of the loop defined by `N^2`. The loop iterates through `i` from 0 to `N^2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N^2` is a positive integer that can be between 1 and 7, resulting in `N^2` values from 1 to 49.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `N^2`. Since `i` is currently 1, it can execute again as long as `N^2` is greater than 1. After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `N^2` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is `N^2`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the `dp` array has been fully updated, for the loop to execute a second time `N^2` must be greater than 2.**
