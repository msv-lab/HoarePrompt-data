According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m`, using the variable `j`. The current value of `j` is 1, which indicates that the loop has executed once already. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, meaning the loop can execute a second time if `m` is at least 2 (since it needs to cover the range up to `m`). The state of `N`, `i`, `s`, and `k` remains unchanged, as they do not affect the control flow of the loop directly.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be 2, and `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2.**
