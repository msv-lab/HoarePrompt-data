According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least `N + 1`, which means `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1 to become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**.
