According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is at least `N + 1`, and given that `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state of `k` will be `s`, as the loop iterates from 1 to `s` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to establish that `k` begins at 1, and since `s` is defined as being at least `N + 1`, it will be sufficient to confirm that `s` is at least 2, allowing `k` to take values from 1 to `s`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time, k will take values from 1 to s inclusive, and `j` is 1**
