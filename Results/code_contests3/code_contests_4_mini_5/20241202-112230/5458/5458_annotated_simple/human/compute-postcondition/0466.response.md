According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop iterates as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, which means the loop has executed for the last valid value of `k`. 

Since `k` starts from 1 and goes up to `s`, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 2 (the next iteration value). However, since `k` is already equal to `s`, it cannot execute again for this value, and thus this is the final iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, but `k` cannot exceed `s` so the loop cannot execute again.**
