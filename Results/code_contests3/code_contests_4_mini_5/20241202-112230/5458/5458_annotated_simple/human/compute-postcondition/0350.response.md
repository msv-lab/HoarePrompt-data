Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. The `dp` array has been updated based on the conditions checked during each iteration, resulting in `dp[1][j + 1][k]` being set to 1 if `i == 0` and `j >= k`, or `dp[1][j + 1][k]` being updated with the computed values based on `dp[i][j][k]` and `dp[i][j][k - j]` otherwise.**
