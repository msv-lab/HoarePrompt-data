Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7); if `j` is greater than `k`, then `i` is incremented by 1; `j` is updated to 3; `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
