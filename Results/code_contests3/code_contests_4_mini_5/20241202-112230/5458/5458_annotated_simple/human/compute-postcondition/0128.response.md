Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), if `j` is greater than `k`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to 3, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur.***
