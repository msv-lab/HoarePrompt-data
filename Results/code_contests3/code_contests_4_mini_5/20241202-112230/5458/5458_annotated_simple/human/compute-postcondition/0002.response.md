The statement `n, m, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` assigns values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` based on user input. The `raw_input().split()` function takes a line of input, splits it into separate components (based on spaces), and the `map(int, ...)` function converts those components into integers. The values for `n`, `m`, and `s` will depend on the input provided, and their specific values are not given in the initial state.

The initial state indicates that `N`, `M`, and `S` can take on any positive integer values within their specified ranges. However, since the actual input is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values for `n`, `m`, and `s`. Thus, the output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), and `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned based on the input values.**
