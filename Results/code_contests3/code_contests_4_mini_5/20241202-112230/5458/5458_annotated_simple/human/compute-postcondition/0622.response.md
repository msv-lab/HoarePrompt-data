According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while 1`, which means it is an infinite loop and will always execute indefinitely unless interrupted. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time, as it can proceed without any conditions.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is `N^2 - 1`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `j` is equal to `m + 1`, `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000), `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and the value of `dp[n**`
