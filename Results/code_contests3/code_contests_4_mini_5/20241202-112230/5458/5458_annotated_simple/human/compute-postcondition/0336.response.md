The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
