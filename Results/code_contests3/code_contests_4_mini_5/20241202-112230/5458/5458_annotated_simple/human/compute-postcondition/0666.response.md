Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is 2 after the first iteration, and for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.***
