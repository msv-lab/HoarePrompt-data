The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[0][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
