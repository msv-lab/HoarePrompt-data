Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][6][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 5, `j` is 5, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
