Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, `k` is 1, and `j` is `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
