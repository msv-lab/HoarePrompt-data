According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop runs for `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4 and `s` is at least 5. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 5, and `s` must remain at least 5 to allow for this iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute a fifth time, `s` must be at least 5.**
