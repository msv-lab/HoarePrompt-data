The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The current values are `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. 

Calculating `i + 1 & 1`:
- `i + 1` is `3`.
- `3 & 1` results in `1` (since binary 3 is `11` and binary 1 is `01`, their AND operation gives `01`).

Now calculating `j + 1`:
- `j + 1` is `4`.

So the expression becomes:
- `dp[1][4][1] = dp[1][3][1] % mod`.

This assigns the value of `dp[1][3][1] % mod` to `dp[1][4][1]`. 

No other variables have been altered by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][1] % mod`.**
