Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3 & 1][3][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][3][3]` has been updated based on the value of `dp[0][2][3] % mod`, and `dp[1][3][3]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][1] % mod.`***
