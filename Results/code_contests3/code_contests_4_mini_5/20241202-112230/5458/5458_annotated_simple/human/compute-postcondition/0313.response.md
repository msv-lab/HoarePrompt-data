The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input values provided through `raw_input()`. The values are parsed as integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous states of the variables `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged, but `n`, `m`, and `s` will be equal to the input values. The final state of `dp[n]` is reflected in the code as it indicates the value related to `n`. However, since the actual input is not known, we will refer to `n`, `m`, and `s` as the provided input integers.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `M` is a positive integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), `S` is a positive integer (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000); `n`, `m`, `s` are integers from input.**
