Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is such that `j <= m - 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` remains unchanged.***
