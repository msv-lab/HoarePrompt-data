Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is 5. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][5]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][5]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
