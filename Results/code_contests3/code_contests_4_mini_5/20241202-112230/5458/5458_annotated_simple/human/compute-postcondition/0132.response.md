According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates for values of `k` from 1 to `s`, meaning that for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 4 (since `k` would be incremented to 4). 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 4**
