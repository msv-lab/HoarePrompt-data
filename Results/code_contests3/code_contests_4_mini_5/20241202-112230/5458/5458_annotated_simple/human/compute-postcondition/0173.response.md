Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `i` is at least 3, `m` is at least 4, `j` is equal to 4, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated with value `1` at either `dp[0][5][3]` or `dp[1][5][3]`. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.***
