The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` is evaluated. 

First, we need to analyze the values of the variables involved:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1.
- `j` is 3, so `j + 1` is 4.
- `k` is 1.

Next, we calculate `i + 1 & 1`:
- `1 & 1` results in `1`.

Now, substituting the values:
- The expression becomes `dp[1][4][1] = 1`.

This assignment modifies the 3D array `dp` at the position `[1][4][1]`, but does not affect the other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, or `k`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[1][4][1]` has been assigned the value `1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.**
