According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7. Therefore, `n` can range from 1 to 7, which means `n ** 2` can range from 1 to 49. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. If `i` is currently at its maximum value (i.e., `n ** 2 - 1`), the next value of `i` will be `n ** 2`, which exceeds the limit, and the loop will terminate.

If `i` is currently less than `n ** 2 - 1`, then it can be incremented. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n ** 2` must be greater than `i + 1`**
