According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `m`. The loop is designed to execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3**
