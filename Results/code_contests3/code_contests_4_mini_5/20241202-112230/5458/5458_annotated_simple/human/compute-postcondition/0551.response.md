Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][2][3]` remains unchanged; `dp[3][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[3][1][3] % mod; dp[1][2][3]` is updated with `dp[0][1][2] % mod.***
