The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop without affecting the values of the variables. Consequently, the values of `N`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
