The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is now 3, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
