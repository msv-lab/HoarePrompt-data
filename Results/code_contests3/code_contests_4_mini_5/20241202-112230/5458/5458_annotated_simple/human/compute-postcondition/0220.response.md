Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is at least `N + 1`, `m` is at least 1, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least `N`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, while the values of `N`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to the `dp` array or the other variables.***
