The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that the value at the 3D array `dp` is being updated based on its previous value. 

- The term `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `i + 1 & 1` will be 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to 0 when `i + 1` is even and to 1 when `i + 1` is odd.
- `j + 1` is simply the next index of `j`, and it is incremented by 1.
- `k` remains equal to 3 as it is not modified in this line.

The overall impact of this code is to copy the value from one position in the `dp` array to another, based on the current values of `i` and `j`.

The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not affect the output state directly since they are not being printed or assigned new values. However, it is important to note that `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, and `k` remains as 3.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
