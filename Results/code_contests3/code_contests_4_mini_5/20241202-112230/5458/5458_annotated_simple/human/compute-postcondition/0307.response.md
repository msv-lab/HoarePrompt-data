Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is an integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
