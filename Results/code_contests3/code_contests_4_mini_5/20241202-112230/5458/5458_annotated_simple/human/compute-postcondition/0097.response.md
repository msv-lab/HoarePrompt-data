According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` iterates from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3. Hence, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, and `k` is 3.**
