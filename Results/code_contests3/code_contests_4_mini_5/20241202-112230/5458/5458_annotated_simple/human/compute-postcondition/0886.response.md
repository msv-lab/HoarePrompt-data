According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 4, and `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4. For the loop to execute a fourth time, `s` must be at least 4.**
