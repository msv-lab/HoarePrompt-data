The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
