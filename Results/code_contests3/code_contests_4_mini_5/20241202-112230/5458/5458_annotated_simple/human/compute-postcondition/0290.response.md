According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will iterate for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 2. This means that there is at least one more value for `k` that the loop can iterate over.

Since `k` starts at 1 and is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. The loop will execute with the new value of `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is an integer. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
