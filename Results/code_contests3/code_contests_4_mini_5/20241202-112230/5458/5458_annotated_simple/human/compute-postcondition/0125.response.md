Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, an assignment is made to `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
