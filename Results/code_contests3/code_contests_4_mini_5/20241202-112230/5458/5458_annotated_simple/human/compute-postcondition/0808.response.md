Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is such that `j <= m - 1`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
