Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop or statement. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no action is taken, maintaining the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k`.***
