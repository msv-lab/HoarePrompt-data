The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, `dp[0][5][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][2] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
