The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the program will skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is an integer, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` while we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
