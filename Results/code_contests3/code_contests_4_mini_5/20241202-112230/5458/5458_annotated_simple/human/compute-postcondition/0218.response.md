The code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but the relationship shows that `j` is incremented by 1 while `k` remains the same. The output state will reflect that `dp` has been updated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Since `j` is greater than `k`, we know that `j + 1` will also be greater than `k`. However, since we are not given explicit values for these variables, we cannot specify exact values for the `dp` array.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the `dp` array has been updated without specifying exact values because they depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, reflecting the update in the `dp` array.**
