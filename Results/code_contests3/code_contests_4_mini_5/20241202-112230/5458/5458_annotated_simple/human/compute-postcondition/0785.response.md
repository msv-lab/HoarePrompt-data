According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`, and if the loop has executed once, `k` would be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must increase by 1. Therefore, if the loop has executed for `k = 1`, it will execute again for `k = 2`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be 2**
