According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 3**
