Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7). If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, while if `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made. If `i` is 1, `k` is 2, and if `j` is defined, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; otherwise, no updates occur if the loop does not execute.***
