The code snippet modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in `1` when `i` is `0`, as `1 & 1` equals `1`.
2. The expression `j + 1` results in `4` since `j` is `3`.
3. The `k` variable is unchanged during this operation.

Therefore, the code updates `dp[1][4][k]`:
- It adds to `dp[1][4][k]` the value of `dp[0][3][k - 3] % mod`.

Since `i` is `0`, we look at `dp[0][3][k - 3]`. The value of `k` is not defined in the initial state, but the operation will depend on its value.

As a result, `dp` is updated based on the above calculations, while the values of `N`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][4][k]` is updated with `dp[0][3][k - 3] % mod`**.
