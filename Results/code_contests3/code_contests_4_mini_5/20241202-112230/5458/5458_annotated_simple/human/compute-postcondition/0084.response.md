Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
