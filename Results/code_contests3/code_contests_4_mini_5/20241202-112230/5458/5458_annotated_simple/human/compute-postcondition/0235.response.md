Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, `k` is `s + 2`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of `dp`.***
