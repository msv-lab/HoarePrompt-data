The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is such that `j <= m - 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
