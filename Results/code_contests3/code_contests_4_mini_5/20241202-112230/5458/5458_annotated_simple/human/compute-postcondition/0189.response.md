According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The loop variable `k` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration until it reaches `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `k` is at the last value it can take before exceeding `s`. 

Given that `s` is a variable that can affect the loop’s execution, if `s` is, for example, 4, the loop can execute for `k` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4. If `k` is currently at 4, the loop can execute one more time only if `s` is at least 5, allowing `k` to increment to 5.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop would have executed for `k` equal to 1 through `s`. Assuming `k` is currently equal to `s`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than the last value of `k` (which is `s`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][6][1]` is set to 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 5, and `k` is 5.**
