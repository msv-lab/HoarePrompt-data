Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been fully updated, `m` is at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on previous values in the `dp` array, incorporating the modulo operation as specified.**
