According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and since `s` is at least 2, it is possible to execute the loop again. The next value for `k` would be 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1.  

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3, and `j` is an integer. For the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3.**
