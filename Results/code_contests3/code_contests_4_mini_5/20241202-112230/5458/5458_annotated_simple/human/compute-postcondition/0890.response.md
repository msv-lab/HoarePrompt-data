The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4; `dp[1][3][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][4]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
