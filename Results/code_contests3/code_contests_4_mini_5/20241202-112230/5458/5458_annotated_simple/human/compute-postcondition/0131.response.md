Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7). If `i` is 0, then `i` is incremented by 1, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 3, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, an assignment is made to `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `i` is not 0, then `i` is incremented by 1 if `j` is greater than `k`, `j` is updated to 3, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
