According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The range for the loop is from 1 to `m + 1`, meaning that for the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least 1. The variable `i` is set to 0 and does not influence the execution of this loop. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` should start at 1. Therefore, the necessary state adjustments are that `m` must be at least 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute `m` must be at least 1, and `j` is 1**.
