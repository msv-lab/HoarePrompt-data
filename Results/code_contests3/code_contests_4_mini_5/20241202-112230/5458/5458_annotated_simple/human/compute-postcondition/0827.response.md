Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is such that `j <= m`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` has been updated according to the logic of the loop; specifically, `dp[1][j][k]` will be set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, or updated based on previous states otherwise.**
