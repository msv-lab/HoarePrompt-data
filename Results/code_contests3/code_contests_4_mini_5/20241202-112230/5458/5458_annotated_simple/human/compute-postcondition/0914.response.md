The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and move to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state is simply a description of the current situation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 4, `m` is at least 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
