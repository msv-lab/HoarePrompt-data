According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 and is now less than or equal to `m`, meaning that `k` can take its next value in the range. Since `k` is currently iterating from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
