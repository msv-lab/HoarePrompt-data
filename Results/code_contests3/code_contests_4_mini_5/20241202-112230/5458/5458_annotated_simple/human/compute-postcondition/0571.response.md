The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][3][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][2][2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
