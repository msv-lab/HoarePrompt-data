According to the code, the execution of the loop is determined by the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least `N + 1` (where `N` is at most 7), `s` could be at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `k` will be 3. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3.**
