Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is defined, and `k` is 1 greater than the maximum value processed during the loop. The `dp` array has been updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, resulting in values assigned according to the logic provided, with potential values of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` being 1 or updated by previous computations modulo `mod`.**
