Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `k` is `s + 2`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the program state. In the else case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
