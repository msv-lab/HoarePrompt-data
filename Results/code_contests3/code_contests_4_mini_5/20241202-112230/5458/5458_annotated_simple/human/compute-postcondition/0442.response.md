According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `3`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by `1`. 

Since `s` is at least `3`, the loop can execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `3`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be `4`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 4 for the loop to execute a second time**
