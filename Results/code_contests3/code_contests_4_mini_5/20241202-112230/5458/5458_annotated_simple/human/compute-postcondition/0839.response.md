The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the rest of the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `dp` has been fully updated, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` starts at 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[1][2][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[1][1][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s`, `dp` has been fully updated, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` starts at 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[1][2][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[1][1][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
