Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and `m` is at least 3. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, and for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`, the values will depend on the relationship between `j` and `k`. Specifically, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][k]` will be set to 1; otherwise, it will be updated by adding values from previous states of the `dp` array.**
