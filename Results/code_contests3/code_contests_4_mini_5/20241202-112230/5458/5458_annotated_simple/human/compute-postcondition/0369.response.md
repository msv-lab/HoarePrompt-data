The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement; however, it affects the flow of control within the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
