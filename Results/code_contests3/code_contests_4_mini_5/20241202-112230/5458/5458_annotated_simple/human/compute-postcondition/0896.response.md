According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 3.

Since the value of `m` is not specified but can be inferred from the context, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again, given that `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3**
