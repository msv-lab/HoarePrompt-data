Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7) and `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][3][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[0][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][3] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
