Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1 depending on the number of iterations, `j` is incremented based on the loop conditions, `k` will have taken values from 1 to `s`, and `dp` has been updated according to the logic in the loop; specifically, `dp[1][j][k]` will be set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j >= k`, or updated based on previous states otherwise.**
