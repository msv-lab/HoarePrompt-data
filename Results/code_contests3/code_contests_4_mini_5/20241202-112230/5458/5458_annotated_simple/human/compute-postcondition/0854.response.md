The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. To determine the indices, we calculate:
- `i + 1` is `2 + 1` which equals `3`.
- `j + 1` is `1 + 1` which equals `2`.
- The value of `k` is `s + 2`, but the exact value of `s` is not provided, so `k` remains as `s + 2`.

Thus, we update the array at the position `dp[3 & 1][2][s + 2]`. The expression `3 & 1` evaluates to `1` since `3` in binary is `11` and `1` is `01`, resulting in `01`, which is `1` in decimal.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 2`, and the value of `dp[1][2][k]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 2`, `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1**
