Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is determined based on the conditions in the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated according to the logic described, taking into account the values stored in the `dp` array and the modulo operation.**
