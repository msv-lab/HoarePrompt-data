Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program does not enter the if statement, and the current state remains unchanged.***
