Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is greater than `k`.***
