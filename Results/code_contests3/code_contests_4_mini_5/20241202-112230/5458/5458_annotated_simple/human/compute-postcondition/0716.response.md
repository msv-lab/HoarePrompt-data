Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is updated based on the value of `i`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][3][k - j]`, which refers to an invalid index.***
