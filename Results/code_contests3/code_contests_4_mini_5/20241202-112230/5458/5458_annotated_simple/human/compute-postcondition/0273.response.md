The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3, we need to consider that `dp` is a multi-dimensional array that depends on the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

However, without knowing the specific values of `i`, `j`, and the contents of the `dp` array prior to this operation, we cannot determine the exact changes to the `dp` array. 

Thus, the output state must reflect that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp`, but we cannot specify exact values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
