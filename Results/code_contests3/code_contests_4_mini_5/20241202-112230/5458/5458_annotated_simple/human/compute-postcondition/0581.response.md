Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][3]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the variables.***
