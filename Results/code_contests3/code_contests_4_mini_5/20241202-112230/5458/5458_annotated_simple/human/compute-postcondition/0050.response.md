The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop, causing the program to proceed to the next iteration without executing any further code in the current loop. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this command. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to the values of the variables, but it indicates that the next iteration of the loop will begin.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
