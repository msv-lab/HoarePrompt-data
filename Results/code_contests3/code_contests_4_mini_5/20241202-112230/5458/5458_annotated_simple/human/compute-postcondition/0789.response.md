The code `continue` causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this command, and it does not affect the current state of `N`, `s`, `k`, or `dp`. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the state remains unchanged with the note about continuing the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
