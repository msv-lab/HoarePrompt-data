According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and since the loop increments `j` by 1, the next value of `j` will be 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 4**
