According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop is designed to execute for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 3.

Since the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
