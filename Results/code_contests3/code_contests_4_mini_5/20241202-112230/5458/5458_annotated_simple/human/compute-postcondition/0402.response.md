The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the values of the variables, but we note that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been updated, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
