The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
