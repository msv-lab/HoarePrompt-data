The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, `j` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
