The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the values of the variables do not change but we skip the rest of the current iteration, the output state reflects the values before the `continue` statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `dp` has been updated, `m` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
