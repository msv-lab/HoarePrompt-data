Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[1][2][3]`.***
