The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is defined or not defined, `k` is currently `k + 1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the nearest loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is defined or not defined, `k` is currently `k + 1`, and we skip to the next iteration of the nearest loop.**
