Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][4][2]` is set to the value of `dp[0][3][2]`, and the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables or data structures.***
