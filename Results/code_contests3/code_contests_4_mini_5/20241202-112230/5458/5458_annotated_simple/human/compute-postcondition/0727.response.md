Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is `N^2`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the `dp` array has been fully updated according to the logic specified in the loop, reflecting all applicable conditions, with `dp[1][N^2 + 1][k]` potentially containing values derived from the computations modulo `mod`.**
