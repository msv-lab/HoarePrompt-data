The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The array is indexed using `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`.

1. **Calculating `i + 1 & 1`**: 
   - Given `i` is 0, the expression evaluates as follows:
   - `i + 1` becomes `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`.

2. **Calculating `j + 1`**:
   - Given `j` is 2, `j + 1` becomes `3`.

3. **Indexing into `dp`**:
   - The left side of the assignment becomes `dp[1][3][k]`.
   - The right side is `dp[1][2][k]`.

4. **Assignment**:
   - The value at `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned to `dp[1][3][k]`.

The values of `N`, `k`, and `s` are not directly affected by this assignment, and since the specific contents of the `dp` array are unknown, we cannot provide specific numerical outputs for them, only the relationship established by the assignment.

Therefore, the output state reflects the update made to `dp`:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `dp[1][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][k]`**.
