The values of the variables do not change but we skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration where we will continue executing the loop if the conditions are met. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
