The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it skips the current iteration of the loop, moving to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `s`, `k`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
