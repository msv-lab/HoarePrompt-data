The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution flow indicates that the loop will continue.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop since the condition for the loop execution is still valid.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
