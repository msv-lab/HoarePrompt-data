The `continue` statement is encountered but does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it causes the current iteration of the loop to skip the remaining code and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the loop control flow.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is such that `j <= m - 1`, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
