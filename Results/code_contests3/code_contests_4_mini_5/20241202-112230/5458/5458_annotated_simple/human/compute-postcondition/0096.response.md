Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `j` is less than or equal to `m`, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, no changes occur. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
