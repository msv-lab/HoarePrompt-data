According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes to `s + 1`. The current state indicates `N` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1. 

To ensure the loop executes for the first time, `s` must be set to a value greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1 (the first value in the range)**
