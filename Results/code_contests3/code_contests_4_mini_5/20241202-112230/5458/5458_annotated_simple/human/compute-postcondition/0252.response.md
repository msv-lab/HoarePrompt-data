The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the affected variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
