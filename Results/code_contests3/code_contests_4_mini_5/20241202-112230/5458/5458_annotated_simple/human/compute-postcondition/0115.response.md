Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 1 on the first iteration and 2 on the second iteration. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.***
