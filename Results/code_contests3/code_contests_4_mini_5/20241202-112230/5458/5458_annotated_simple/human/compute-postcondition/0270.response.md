The code contains the statement `continue`, which does not change the values of the variables `N`, `s`, `k`, or `dp`. Instead, it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
