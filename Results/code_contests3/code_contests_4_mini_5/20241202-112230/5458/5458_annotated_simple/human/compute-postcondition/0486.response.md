According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s` (inclusive). Since `k` is initialized to `s` and `s` is at least 3, the loop will execute initially with `k` starting from 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2 after the first iteration. Given that `s` is at least 3, the loop can continue to execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

The current values of `i`, `j`, `N`, and `m` do not impact the execution of the loop directly. Therefore, the relevant states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute a second time are `k` (which must be 2 after the first iteration) and `s` (which must be at least 3 to allow for multiple iterations).

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute the second time `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 3**
