According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, since the range is from 1 to `s + 1`. The variable `N` being a positive integer does not directly affect the execution of the loop; however, `i` is already initialized to 0, which is fine since it is not used in the loop initialization.

For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1**
