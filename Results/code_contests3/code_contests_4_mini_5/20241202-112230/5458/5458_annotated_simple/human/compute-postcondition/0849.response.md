Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. Otherwise, no operation occurs as there is no else part.***
