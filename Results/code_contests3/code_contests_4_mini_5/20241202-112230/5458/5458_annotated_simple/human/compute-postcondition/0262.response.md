Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `s` is at least `N + 1`, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the state of the program.***
