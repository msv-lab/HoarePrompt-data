The variable `dp` is being updated based on the previous values of `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is currently 1, `i + 1` equals 2, and `2 & 1` results in 0. Therefore, the left-hand side of the assignment accesses `dp[0][j + 1][k]`, which uses the current values of `j` (2) and `k` (2).

On the right-hand side, we access `dp[0][j][k]`, which corresponds to `dp[0][2][2]`. The assignment is effectively copying the value from `dp[0][2][2]` to `dp[0][3][2]`. 

Given that `j` is currently 2, after the operation, the state of `dp` changes, but the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2; updated dp[0][3][2] = dp[0][2][2]**
