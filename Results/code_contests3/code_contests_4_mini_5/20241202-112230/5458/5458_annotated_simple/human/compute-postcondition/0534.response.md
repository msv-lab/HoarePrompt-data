According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `k`, which increases with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute for `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
