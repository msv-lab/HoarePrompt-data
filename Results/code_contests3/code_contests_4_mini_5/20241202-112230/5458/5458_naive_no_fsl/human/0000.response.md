To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step in relation to the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple datasets until it encounters the line "0 0 0", which is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program initializes a 3D list `dp` to keep track of the number of ways to fill the bingo card while adhering to the constraints provided (e.g., ascending order in columns, unique integers).

3. **Constraints Implementation**:
   - It checks that integers are between 1 and M.
   - It ensures that the sum of the integers equals S.
   - The program uses a nested loop structure to fill the `dp` table, considering each integer placement and the conditions specified.

4. **Column and Row Constraints**: The program attempts to generate valid configurations while maintaining the rule that each column is sorted and that integers in each row are greater than those in the left column.

However, upon closer inspection, we can identify potential issues with the logic:

- The way the program iterates and checks conditions in the `dp` table does not distinctively enforce the requirement that the integers must be unique across the entire bingo card. This could lead to scenarios where duplicates are inadvertently counted as valid configurations.

- The logic involving `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` lacks clarity and explicit checks for uniqueness, which is a core requirement of the problem.

**Counterexample**:
Suppose we have a small input to illustrate the potential issue:
```
1 2 2
```
This input means:
- N = 1 (1x1 Bingo card)
- M = 2 (integers can be from 1 to 2)
- S = 2 (the sum must equal 2)

The valid bingo card for this case is:
```
2
```
However, if the program incorrectly counts configurations involving duplicates (for example, if it allowed for two configurations with the same integer due to faulty logic), it would produce an incorrect count.

Given the potential for duplicate integers and the lack of a clear mechanism in the code to enforce uniqueness across the full range of integers while fulfilling all constraints, we conclude that the program may not satisfy the problem requirements in all cases.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
