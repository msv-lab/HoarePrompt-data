Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The initialization of the `dp` table is not aligned with the problem's requirements. The problem requires a specific arrangement of integers in the Bingo card, and the way the `dp` table is filled does not ensure that the integers are placed in ascending order in columns or that each integer is larger than those in the column to the left.

2. **Logic for Filling the `dp` Table**: The nested loops for filling the `dp` table do not accurately represent the conditions set forth in the problem description. The logic used in the program seems to be incorrect as it does not effectively track the constraints regarding the maximum integer `M`, the sum `S`, and the arrangement of numbers in the Bingo card. Specifically, the conditions for filling the table do not ensure that each subsequent integer in a column is larger than the previous entries, nor that they are in ascending order.

3. **Handling of Input and Output**: The program reads input using `raw_input()` and uses `xrange()` which is not compatible with Python 3. Additionally, the output is printed directly rather than returning a value, which may not align with typical function behavior.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The handling of results using modulo 100,000 is present, but the results computed from the `dp` table may not represent the actual number of valid Bingo cards due to the flaws mentioned above.

Overall, the program does not meet the problem's requirements to generate valid Bingo cards according to the specified conditions, leading to an incorrect implementation of the problem description.
