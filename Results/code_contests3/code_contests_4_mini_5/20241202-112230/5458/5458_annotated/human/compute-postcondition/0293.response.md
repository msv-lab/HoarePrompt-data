The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. The previous values of `j` and `k` are given as `j = m + 1` and `k = s + 1`, and since the loop cannot execute again, we maintain the values of `N`, `s`, `m`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given that `k` exceeds the limit of `s`, it suggests that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not updated further, and thus the state remains unchanged on the left-hand side. 

The output state reflects that the values involved in the assignment have not changed but only the reference from `dp` has been made. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is `m + 1` where `m < s`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
