The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables and instead skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop, moving to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the variables, the output state reflects that no modifications occurred.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is reset to 1, `m` must be at least 4, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
