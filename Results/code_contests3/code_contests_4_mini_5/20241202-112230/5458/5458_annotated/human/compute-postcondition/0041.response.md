According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. Since the loop is iterating over `j` from 1 to `m`, it will execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. 

As `m` is not defined explicitly in this context, we know that `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again, given that `j` will take the value of 2 next.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is at most `s`, for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 2.**
