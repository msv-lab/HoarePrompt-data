Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented to `k + 1` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `k` is incremented to `k + 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
