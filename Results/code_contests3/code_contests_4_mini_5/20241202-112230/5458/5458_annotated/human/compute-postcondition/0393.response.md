The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the execution to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State remains the same regarding the variables but notes that we continue in the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp[0][4][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[0][3][3] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
