The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is currently not specified, and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which depends on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Since `k` is 4 and `j` must be less than or equal to `k`, the operation involves reducing `k` by `j`. However, the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `mod` are not provided in the initial state. 

Thus, the output state reflects the update that occurs to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but we can't specify exact values due to the lack of information on `dp`, `i`, and `j`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
