The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop and continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `k` is 2; assignment takes place in `dp` at indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
