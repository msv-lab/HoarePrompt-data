Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in the current iteration.***
