The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. However, the values of the variables do not change due to this statement. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the only indication that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
