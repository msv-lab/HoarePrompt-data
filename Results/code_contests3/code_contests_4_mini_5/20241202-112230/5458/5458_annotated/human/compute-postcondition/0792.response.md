The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that we are updating the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7
- `k` is 3
- `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time
- The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is dependent on the values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`

This means that `k` is 3, so `k - j` will depend on the value of `j`. The operation modifies `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding a value to it. The exact values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod` are not provided, so we cannot determine the final values of `dp`. 

Thus, the output state describes the operation performed on `dp` rather than specific values:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
