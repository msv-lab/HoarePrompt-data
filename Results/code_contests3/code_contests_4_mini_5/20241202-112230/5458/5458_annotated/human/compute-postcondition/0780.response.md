The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and we skip the rest of the current iteration in the loop.
