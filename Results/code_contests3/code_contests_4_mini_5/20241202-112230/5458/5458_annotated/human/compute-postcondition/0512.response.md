The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the remainder of the current iteration of the loop we are inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or 2; `s` is at least 7; `k` is 3; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4; `dp[1][5][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][4][3]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
