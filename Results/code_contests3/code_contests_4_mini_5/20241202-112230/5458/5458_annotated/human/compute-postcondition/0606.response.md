Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 2; `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time; if `j` is greater than `k`, the values of the variables do not change, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
