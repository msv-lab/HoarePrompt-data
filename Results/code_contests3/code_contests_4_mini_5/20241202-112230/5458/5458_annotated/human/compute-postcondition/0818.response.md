According to the code, the loop will execute for every value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 4, and `s` is at least 4, indicating that the loop has executed for `k` values 1 through 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 5, and since `s` is at least 4, it can still accommodate this increment because `s + 1` is at least 5.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 5, `s` is at least 5, and `j` is 3**
