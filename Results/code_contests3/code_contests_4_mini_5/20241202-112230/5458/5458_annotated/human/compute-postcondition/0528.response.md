The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional structure, presumably an array or list named `dp`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`. Since `i` is `3`, `i + 1` is `4`. The binary representation of `4` is `100`, and `1` is `001`. The result of `4 & 1` is `0`.
2. The value of `j + 1` is `4` (since `j` is `3`).
3. The variable `k` remains `1`.

Thus, the indices for the left-hand side of the statement become `dp[0][4][1]`. 

Next, we check the right-hand side: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` translates to `dp[0][3][1]` since `i + 1 & 1` equals `0` and `j` is `3`.

Therefore, the code assigns the value of `dp[0][3][1]` to `dp[0][4][1]`.

The values of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][1]`.**
