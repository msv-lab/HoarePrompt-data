According to the code, the loop's ability to execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n ** 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. Therefore, the maximum value of `n ** 2` can be 49 (when `N` is 7). Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `n ** 2` must be greater than 2.

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3. For the loop to execute again, `n ** 2` must be greater than 3. 

Thus, we can summarize the required state adjustments as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 3 (i.e., `n` must be at least 2).**
