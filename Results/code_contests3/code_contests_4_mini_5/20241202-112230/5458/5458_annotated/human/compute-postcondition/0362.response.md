The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` updates the `dp` array. The value of `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. 

First, we calculate `i + 1 & 1`:
- `i + 1` is 2.
- `2 & 1` results in 0 (binary AND operation).

Next, we calculate `j + 1`:
- `j + 1` is 3.

Thus, we are indexing into `dp[0][3][1]`.

Now, we need to find the value of `dp[0][3][1]`:
- We will assign it the value of `dp[0][2][1] % mod`.

The previous values of `dp` are not provided, but it is stated that `dp[0][3][1]` is being assigned the value from `dp[0][2][1]` mod `mod`.

Since no other variables are affected, the Output State reflects the assignment to the `dp` array:
- We summarize the relevant states and the assignment, noting that the specific value of `dp[0][2][1]` is not known.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1] % mod`.**
