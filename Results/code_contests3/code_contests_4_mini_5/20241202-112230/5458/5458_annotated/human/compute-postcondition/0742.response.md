Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2] % mod`, and `dp[2][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][2][0] % mod`.***
