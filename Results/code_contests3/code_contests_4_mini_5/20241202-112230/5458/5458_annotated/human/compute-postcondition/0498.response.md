Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 2, then `dp[1][5][1]` remains unchanged and is equal to `dp[1][4][1] % mod.***
