Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
