The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are 0, 1, and 3, respectively. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` translates to `dp[1][2][3]`. The source for this assignment is `dp[1][j][k]`, which is `dp[1][1][3]`. 

Since `j` is 1 and `k` is 3, the values of `j` and `k` do not change, and `s` remains unaffected as well. The output state will reflect the change in the `dp` array, where `dp[1][2][3]` is updated based on the modulo operation.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3; `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3] % mod**.
