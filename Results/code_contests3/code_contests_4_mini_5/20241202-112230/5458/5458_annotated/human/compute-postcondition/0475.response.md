According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4 and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `k` is currently 4, it can execute one more time only if `s` is at least 5. After this iteration, `k` will be 5. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5, `m` is at least 3, and `j` is 3.**
