The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves an assignment that updates a specific element in a 3D list or array named `dp`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` influence the indices used to access the `dp` array. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` will compute the value of `i + 1` and apply a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively results in either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
- `j + 1` increases `j` by 1, which is currently 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2.
- The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Since `N` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 7, and `i` is not equal to 0, we can assume `i` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. However, the exact value of `i` is not provided, but it does not affect the calculation of the output state directly.

The output state will reflect the assignment operation performed on the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][1][k]`**
