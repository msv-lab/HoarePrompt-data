The operation modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The initial state indicates that `j` is greater than `k` (where `k` is 3), which means that `k - j` would be negative. Thus, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` would lead to an undefined state as we cannot index into negative dimensions of `dp`. Consequently, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to indexing out of range.**
