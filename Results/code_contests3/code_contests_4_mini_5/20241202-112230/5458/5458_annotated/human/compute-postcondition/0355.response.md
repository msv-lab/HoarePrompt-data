The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array. 

1. The value of `i` is currently 0, thus `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
2. The value of `j` is currently 2, therefore `j + 1` becomes `3`.
3. The value of `k` is currently 1. 

Given these evaluations, the expression modifies `dp[1][3][1]` and sets it to `1`. The previous states of `N`, `s`, and `dp` are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `dp` has been updated such that `dp[1][3][1] = 1`.**
