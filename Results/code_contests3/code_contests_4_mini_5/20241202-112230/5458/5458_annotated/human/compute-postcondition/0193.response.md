The statement `continue` indicates that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the loop control. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
