Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp` has been updated based on the conditions for all values from 1 to `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][4][3]` is updated to the value of `dp[0][3][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
