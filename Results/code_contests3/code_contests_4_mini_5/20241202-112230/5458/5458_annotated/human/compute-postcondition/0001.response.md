In this case, the `while` loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely as it is always true. Therefore, there is no need to modify any states for the loop to proceed. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000.**
