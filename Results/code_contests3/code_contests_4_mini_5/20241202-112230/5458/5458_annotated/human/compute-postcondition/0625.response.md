Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` has been fully updated based on all iterations for all values from 1 to `m` and 1 to `s`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input. If `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
