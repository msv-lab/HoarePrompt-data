The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[0][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][2]` while we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
