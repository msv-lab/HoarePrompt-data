Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 1; `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
