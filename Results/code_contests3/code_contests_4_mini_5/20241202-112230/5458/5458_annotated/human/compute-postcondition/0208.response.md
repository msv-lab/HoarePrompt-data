Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0 or 2; `j` is `m + 1`; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 1; `k` is equal to `s`; `dp` has been fully updated based on the logic defined within the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
