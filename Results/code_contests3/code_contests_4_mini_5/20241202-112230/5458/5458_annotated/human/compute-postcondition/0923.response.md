The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or control structure.
