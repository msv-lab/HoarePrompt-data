According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as the variable `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which indicates that we are currently on the second iteration of the loop. Since `j` is initialized to 1 and incremented in each iteration, after the current iteration, `j` will be 3 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3, as `j` will take on the value of 3 in the next iteration. 

Thus, we need to state that the loop will execute again under the condition that `m` is at least 3, and we also need to update the value of `j` to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3, and `j` will be 3.**
