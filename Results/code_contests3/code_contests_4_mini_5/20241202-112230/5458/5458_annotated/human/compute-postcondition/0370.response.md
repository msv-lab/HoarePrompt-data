Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]` and we move to the next iteration without any further changes to the variables. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur to the variables.***
