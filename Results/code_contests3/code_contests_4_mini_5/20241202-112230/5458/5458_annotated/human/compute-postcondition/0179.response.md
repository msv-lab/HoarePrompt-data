The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates a specific element in the `dp` array. Given that `i` is 0, `j` is 4, and `k` is 1, we need to calculate the indices being accessed in the `dp` array. 

The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates as follows:
- `i + 1` is `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.
- `1 & 1` equals `1`.

For `j + 1`, we have:
- `j + 1` is `4 + 1`, which equals `5`.

Thus, the indices for the `dp` array are `dp[1][5][1]`. 

The operation sets `dp[1][5][1]` to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][5][1]` is set to 1.**
