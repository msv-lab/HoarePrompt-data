The code `continue` is a control statement that causes the loop to skip the rest of its body and proceed to the next iteration. However, in this context, there are no changes to the values of the variables as a result of the `continue` statement itself. The values of `N`, `i`, `s`, `k`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
