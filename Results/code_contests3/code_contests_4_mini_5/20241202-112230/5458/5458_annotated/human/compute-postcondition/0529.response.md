The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the most internal loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][4][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][1]`, and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop.
