The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
