Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][5][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `m` must be at least 4, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
