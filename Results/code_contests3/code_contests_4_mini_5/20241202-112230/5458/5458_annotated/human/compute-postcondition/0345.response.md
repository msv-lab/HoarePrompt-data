The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3; dp[1][1][3] is assigned the value of dp[1][1][3] and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
