Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is 2, then `dp[3][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[3][3][2] % mod`. In the else case, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 3, and `s` is at least 2, while `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on the value of `dp[1][3][-1] % mod`, which is undefined.***
