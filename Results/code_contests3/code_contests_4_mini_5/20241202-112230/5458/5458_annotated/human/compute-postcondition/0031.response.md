According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `k` which is iterating from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Since `s` is at least 1, the value of `s + 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3 and `s` must be at least 2 (since it must be greater than or equal to `k` which is now 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is either 1 or 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3.**
