According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper bound defined by `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. Thus, `n` can take values from 1 to 7, leading to `n ** 2` being in the range from 1 to 49. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2 (resulting in `n ** 2` being at least 4). After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2 (resulting in `n ** 2` being at least 4)**
