Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is 4; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 1; `m` must be at least 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
