According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute for the next value of `j` as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` was at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently at its last value in the iteration (which is `m`), to execute the loop again, `j` would need to be incremented to `m + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be `m + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s`; for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to `m + 1`.**
