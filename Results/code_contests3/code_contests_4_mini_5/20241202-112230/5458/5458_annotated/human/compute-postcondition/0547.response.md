The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[0][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
