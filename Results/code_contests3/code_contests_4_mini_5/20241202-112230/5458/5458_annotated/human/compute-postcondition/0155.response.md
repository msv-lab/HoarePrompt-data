Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, then `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1, resulting in `dp[1][4][1]` being set to 1. If `i` is 2, then `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1, leading to `dp[3][4][1]` being assigned the value of `dp[3][3][1] % mod`, and an operation on `dp` is attempted.***
