Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is `m + 1` where `m < s`. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i != 0` and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; otherwise, no action is taken. In this case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
