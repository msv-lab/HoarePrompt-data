Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7 and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `j` and `mod` are unspecified.***
