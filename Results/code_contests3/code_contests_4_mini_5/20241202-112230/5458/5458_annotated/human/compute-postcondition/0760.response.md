Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3 (where `k` is 3), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, resulting in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` holding the new value.***
