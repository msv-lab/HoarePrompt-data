Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[0][4][1]` is assigned the value 1 since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[0][4][-2]` due to an index out of bounds error.***
