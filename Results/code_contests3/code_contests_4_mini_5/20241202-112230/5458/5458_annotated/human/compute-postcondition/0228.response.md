The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`, and `k` is `2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
