According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently less than or equal to `s` because the loop is set to iterate from 1 to `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

With the current state indicating that `k` was at its current value from the previous iteration, we will adjust `k` for the next iteration. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1 if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[0][3][1]` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
