Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or 2; `s` is at least 7; `k` is 7; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][7]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 2, then `dp[1][5][7]` is calculated based on previous values in the dp array, specifically `dp[1][4][7] % mod` and `dp[0][4][k - j] % mod`.**
