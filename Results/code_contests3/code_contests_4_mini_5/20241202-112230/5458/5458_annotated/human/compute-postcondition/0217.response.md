Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` has been fully updated based on the logic defined within the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` (2 > 1).***
