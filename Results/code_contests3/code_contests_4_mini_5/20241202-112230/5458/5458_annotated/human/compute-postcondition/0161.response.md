Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `j` is greater than `k`, then for `i` being either 0 or 2, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2, the `dp` table is updated accordingly based on the values from the previous index or state, specifically updating `dp[1][4][2]` or `dp[0][4][2]` based on their respective conditions.***
