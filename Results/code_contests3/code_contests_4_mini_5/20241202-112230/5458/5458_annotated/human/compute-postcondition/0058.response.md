The code snippet involves updating a multidimensional array `dp`. The specific operation performed is assigning the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Given the initial state, we have:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `k` remains unchanged
- The value of `dp[1][3][1]` depends on the conditions specified.

Now evaluating the line of code:
- The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 + 1 & 1`, which is `2 & 1`, yielding `0` (as it performs a bitwise AND).
- Therefore `dp[0][j + 1][k]` will be updated, specifically `dp[0][3][1]`.

Since `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]`, the output state will reflect the updated state of `dp[0][3][1]` based on the value of `dp[0][2][k]`, which remains unchanged since `k` is not specified to change.

Thus, the output state will be:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `k` is unchanged; `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]`.**
