The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to 1, so the first index becomes `1`.
2. The value of `j` is `m + 1`, which is not explicitly defined, but since `m` is not provided, we will keep it in terms of `j`. Thus, the second index becomes `j + 1`.
3. The value of `k` remains 2.

This means the left-hand side becomes `dp[1][j + 1][2]`, and the right-hand side is `dp[1][j][2]`.

Since we are assigning the value of `dp[1][j][2]` to `dp[1][j + 1][2]`, the output state will reflect that:

- The values of `N`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The specific relationship between `dp[1][j + 1][2]` and `dp[1][j][2]` is established.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][2]`.**
