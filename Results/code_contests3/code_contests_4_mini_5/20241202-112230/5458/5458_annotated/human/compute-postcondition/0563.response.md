Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is reset to 1, `m` must be at least 4, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][1]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
