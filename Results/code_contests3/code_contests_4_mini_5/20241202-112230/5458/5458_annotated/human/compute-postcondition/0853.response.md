According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by the variable `s`. Since `s` is at least 2 at the end of the last iteration, the loop can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3. 

In this case, `s` is at least 2, so `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is `m + 1`; `s` is at least 3; and `k` is 3.**
