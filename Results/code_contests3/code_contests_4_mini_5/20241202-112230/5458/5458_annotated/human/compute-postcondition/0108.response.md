According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to the square of `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. This means that `n ** 2` can range from 1 (when N=1) to 49 (when N=7).

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1 to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that \( n^2 > 1 \). 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that n^2 > 1**
