The line of code assigns the values from input to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. The initial state mentions that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, and `i` is `N^2`, which means `i` can take values from 1 to 49 depending on `N`. The variables `m` and `s` will be updated based on the user input.

The output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now assigned values based on the user input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` has been fully updated based on all iterations for all values from 1 to `m` and 1 to `s`; `n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input.**
