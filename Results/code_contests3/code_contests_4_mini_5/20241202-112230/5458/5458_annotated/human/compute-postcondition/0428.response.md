The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value from `dp[1][j][1]` and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
