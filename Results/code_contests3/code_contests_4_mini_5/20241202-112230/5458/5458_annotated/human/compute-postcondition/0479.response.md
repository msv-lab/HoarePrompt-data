The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 5, `k` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and the value of `dp[1][4][5]` is assigned from `dp[1][3][5]` as we continue in the loop or statement.
