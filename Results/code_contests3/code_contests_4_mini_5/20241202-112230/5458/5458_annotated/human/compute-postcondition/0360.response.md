The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned to `dp[0][3][1]`, and we continue with the next iteration of the most internal loop.
