The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `j`, `s`, and `k` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
