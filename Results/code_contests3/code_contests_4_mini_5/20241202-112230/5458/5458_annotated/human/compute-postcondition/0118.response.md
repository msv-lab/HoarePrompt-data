The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, but it indicates that we will move on to the next loop iteration if applicable. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `j` is an integer greater than 2; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; and we will skip to the next iteration of the current loop.
