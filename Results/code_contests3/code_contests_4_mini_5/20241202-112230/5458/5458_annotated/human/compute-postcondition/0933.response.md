The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes input data where `N` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 7, `M` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 2000, and `S` is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 3000. The input processing continues until a dataset where `N`, `M`, and `S` are all zero is encountered. Although the function does not return values based on parameters directly, it processes multiple datasets (up to 5) and concludes its operation when the termination condition is met.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers N, M, and S, where the input ends when N, M, S are all zero. The function does not accept parameters directly and handles up to 5 datasets.**
