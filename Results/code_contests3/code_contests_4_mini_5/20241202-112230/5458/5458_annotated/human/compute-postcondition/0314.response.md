The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `M + 1`; `k` is `S`; `dp` has been fully updated; the result is `dp[n]`; `n`, `m`, and `s` are input integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
