The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. No variables are modified, and no specific output is generated from the execution of this code. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is 4; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 1; for the loop to execute the second time `m` must be at least 4; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
