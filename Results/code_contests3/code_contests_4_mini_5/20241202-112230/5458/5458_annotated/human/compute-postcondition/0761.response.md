Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `dp` is updated for all values of `j` and `k` based on the specified conditions in the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` possibly set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values of `dp` depending on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
