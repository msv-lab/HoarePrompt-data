Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
