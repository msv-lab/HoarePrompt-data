The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The effect of this code on the variables is as follows:

1. The value of `i` is either 0 or 2, but we need to analyze both cases.
2. If `i` is 0: 
   - `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
   - `j + 1` is `3 + 1`, which is `4`.
   - Therefore, `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `1`.
   - From the initial state, we know that `dp[1][4][2]` is already set to `1`, so there is no change.

3. If `i` is 2:
   - `i + 1 & 1` results in `3 & 1`, which is `1`.
   - `j + 1` is still `3 + 1`, which is `4`.
   - The assignment would be `dp[1][4][2] = 1`, which again does not change the existing value of `dp[1][4][2]` since it was already `1`.

Thus, regardless of whether `i` is 0 or 2, the value of `dp[1][4][2]` remains unchanged at `1`.

Since the problem includes multiple scenarios but ultimately doesn't change the state of `dp`, the output can be summarized.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or 2; `j` is 3; `m` is at least 3; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `dp[1][4][2]` is 1.**
