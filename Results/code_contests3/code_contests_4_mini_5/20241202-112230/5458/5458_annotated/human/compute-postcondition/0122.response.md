Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2, `j` is an integer greater than 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated by adding `dp[1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
