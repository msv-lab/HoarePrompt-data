Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the values of the variables do not change, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
