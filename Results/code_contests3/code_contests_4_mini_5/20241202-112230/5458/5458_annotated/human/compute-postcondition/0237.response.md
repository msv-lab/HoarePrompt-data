The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration in a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
