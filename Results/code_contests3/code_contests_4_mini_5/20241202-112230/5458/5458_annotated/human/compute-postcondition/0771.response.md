The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, the values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Thus, the output state reflects that we are skipping the current iteration within a loop context.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
