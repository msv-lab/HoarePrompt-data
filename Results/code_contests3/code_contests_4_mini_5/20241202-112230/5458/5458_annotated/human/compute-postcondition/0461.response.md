The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop without modifying any variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
