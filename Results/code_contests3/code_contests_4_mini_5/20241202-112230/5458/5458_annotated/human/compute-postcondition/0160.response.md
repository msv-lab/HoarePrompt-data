The values of the variables do not change, but we continue the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or 2; `j` is 3; `m` is at least 3; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; and `dp[1][4][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][3][2]`, or `dp[0][4][2]` is updated based on `dp[0][3][2]`, and we continue in the loop or statement.
