Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s`, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the condition holds that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is still equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as we continue to the next iteration.***
