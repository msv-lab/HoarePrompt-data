The code contains the `continue` statement. This statement does not modify the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no specific loop context provided, we can only conclude that we are breaking out of the current iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop.
