Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no action is taken. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` added to it.***
