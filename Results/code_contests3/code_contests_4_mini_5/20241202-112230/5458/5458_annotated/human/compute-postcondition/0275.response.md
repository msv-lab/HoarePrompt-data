Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s`; `dp` is updated based on the conditions of the loop for each value of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is at least `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values in `dp`. If `j` is less than `k`, no change to `dp` occurs. In the end, `k` equals `s`, and `dp` reflects the computations made during the loop execution.**
