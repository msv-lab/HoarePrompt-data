According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1. The variable `j` will start at 1 during the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1, `j` is 1**
