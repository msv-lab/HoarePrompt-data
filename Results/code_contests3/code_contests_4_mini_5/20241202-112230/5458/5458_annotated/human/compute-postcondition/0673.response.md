The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` modifies the `dp` array based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, so its specific value is not given, but it's crucial for indexing.
2. The value of `j` is equal to 3, and `k` is equal to 1.
3. The expression `k - j` evaluates to `1 - 3`, which is `-2`. Assuming that `dp` is defined for all these indices, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` refers to `dp[i & 1][3][-2]`, which may not be valid if negative indices are not allowed. However, without additional context about the boundaries of the `dp` array, we will proceed with the computation as is.
4. The operation involves taking `dp[i & 1][3][-2] % mod` and adding it to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]`.

Since we do not have the actual values of `dp`, we can only express the state in terms of operations performed rather than final numeric values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][3][-2] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][3][-2] % mod`**.
