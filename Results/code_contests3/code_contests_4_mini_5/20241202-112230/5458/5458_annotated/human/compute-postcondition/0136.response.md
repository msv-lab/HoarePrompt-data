The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement within the current block. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 2; `m` is at least 2; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
