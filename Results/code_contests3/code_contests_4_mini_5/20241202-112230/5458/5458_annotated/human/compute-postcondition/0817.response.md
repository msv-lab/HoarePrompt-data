Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 4, `s` is at least 4, and `j` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` cannot be fully evaluated due to the undefined variable `i`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
