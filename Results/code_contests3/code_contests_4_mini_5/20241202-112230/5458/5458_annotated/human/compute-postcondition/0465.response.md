Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute the third time, and `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is updated with the value of `dp[0][3][0] % mod.***
