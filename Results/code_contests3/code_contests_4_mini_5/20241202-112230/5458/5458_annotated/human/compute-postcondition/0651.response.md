According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `k` which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than `s`. Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, and `k` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` will be 3 in the next iteration). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3.**
