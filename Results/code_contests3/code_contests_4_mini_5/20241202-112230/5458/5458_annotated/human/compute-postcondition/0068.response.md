The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the sequence we were in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is incremented to `k + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
