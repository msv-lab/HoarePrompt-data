According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s + 1`, which means it will execute `s` times. Given that `s` remains at least `1`, the loop will execute at least once, provided that `s` is set correctly. 

The initial states are:
- `N` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), which does not affect the execution of the loop.
- `i` is `1`, which is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
- `j` is `m + 1`, which also does not affect the loop.
- `s` is at least `1`, which ensures the loop will execute.
- `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which is the state before the loop starts.

For the loop to execute, `k` needs to start from `1` instead of `s + 1`. The loop will iterate with `k` taking values from `1` to `s`, inclusive.

Thus, the relevant states to adjust are:
- `k` should be set to `1` to ensure it starts iterating correctly.
- `s` should remain at least `1` to allow for at least one iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute**.
