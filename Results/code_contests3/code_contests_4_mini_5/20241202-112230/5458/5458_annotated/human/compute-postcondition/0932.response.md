Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `M + 1`; `k` is `S + 1`; `dp` has been fully updated based on all iterations for all values from 1 to `M` and 1 to `S`; the output is `dp[N^2 & 1][M + 1][S] % mod`, and the loop terminates when `n`, `m`, `s` are all 0.**
