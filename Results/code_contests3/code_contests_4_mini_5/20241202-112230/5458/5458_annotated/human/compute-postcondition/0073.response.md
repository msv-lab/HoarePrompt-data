Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is updated based on the last executed value, `s` remains at least 1, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. The `dp` array will have been modified based on the conditions within the loop for each value of `k`, specifically depending on the conditions of `i` and `j` during the loop's execution.**
