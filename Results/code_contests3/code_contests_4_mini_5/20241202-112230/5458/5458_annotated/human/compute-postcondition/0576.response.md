According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 3. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 3. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute a third time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must still be at least 3.**
