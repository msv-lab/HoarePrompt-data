According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. The current value of `k` at the end of the last iteration is 2. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time for `k` equal to 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Thus, `k` will be 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3**
