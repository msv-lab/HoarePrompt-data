The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed. This means that the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
