Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to indexing out of range.***
