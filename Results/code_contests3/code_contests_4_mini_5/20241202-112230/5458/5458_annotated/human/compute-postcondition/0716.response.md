Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 4; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, an assignment is attempted to `dp[1][5][2]` from `dp[0][4][-2]`, which results in an invalid index.***
