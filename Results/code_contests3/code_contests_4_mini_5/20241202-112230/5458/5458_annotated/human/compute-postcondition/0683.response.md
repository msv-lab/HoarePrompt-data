Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2] % mod` and updated by adding `dp[0][3][0] % mod`.***
