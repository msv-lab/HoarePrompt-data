According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, and since the loop is set to iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, it will not execute again for the next value of `k`, which is `s + 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, but since `k` will exceed the allowable range of `1 ≤ k ≤ s`, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is `m + 1` where `m < s`. The loop cannot execute again since `k` exceeds the limit of `s`.**
