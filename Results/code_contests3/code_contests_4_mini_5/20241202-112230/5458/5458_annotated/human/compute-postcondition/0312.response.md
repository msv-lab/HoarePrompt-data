According to the code, the `while 1` loop is an infinite loop, which means it will always execute again regardless of the state. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any of the states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `M + 1`; `k` is `S`; `dp` has been fully updated; the result is `dp[n`**
