Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute the third time, `j` is 3, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no updates occur within this if block.***
