According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. This means the loop has executed for `k = 1` and `k = 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `s` is at least 2, `k` can take the value of 3, thus allowing the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, `k` will be updated to 3 for the next iteration. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 2**
