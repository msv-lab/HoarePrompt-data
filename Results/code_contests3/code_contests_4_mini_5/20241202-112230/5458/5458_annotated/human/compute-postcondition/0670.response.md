The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.  
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
