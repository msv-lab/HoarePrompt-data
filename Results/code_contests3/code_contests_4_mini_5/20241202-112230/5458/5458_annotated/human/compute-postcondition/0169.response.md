The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code for the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `N`, `k`, `s`, and `dp` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop without any changes to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 4 for the loop to execute a second time; `s` is at least 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
