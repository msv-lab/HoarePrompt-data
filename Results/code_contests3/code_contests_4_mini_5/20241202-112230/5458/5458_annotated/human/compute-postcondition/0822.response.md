The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but the program will continue its execution from the next iteration of the loop, if there is one.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 5, `s` is at least 5, `j` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 5, `s` is at least 5, `j` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
