The statement updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The variable `k` is 2, which means the operation is applied to the array `dp` at the appropriate indices based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, `dp`, or `mod`, so we cannot determine the exact changes in these variables. The output will reflect the operation performed and the structure of the variables affected.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` based on the given conditions.**
