Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
