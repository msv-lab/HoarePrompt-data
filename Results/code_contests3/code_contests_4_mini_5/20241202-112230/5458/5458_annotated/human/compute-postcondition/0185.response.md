Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `m` is at least 4, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` has been updated based on the logic defined within the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k` (4 > 1), then `dp[1][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][4][1]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
