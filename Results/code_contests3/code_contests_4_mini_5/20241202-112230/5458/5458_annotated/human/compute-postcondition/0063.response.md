Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1. If not, `dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` remains unchanged, `dp[0][3][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][2][k] % mod`, and `dp[0][3][k]` is incremented by `dp[1][2][k - 2] % mod`.***
