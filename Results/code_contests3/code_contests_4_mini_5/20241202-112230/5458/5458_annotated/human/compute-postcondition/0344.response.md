The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is 0 or 1. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1. Therefore, the indices for `dp` being referenced are `dp[1][j][k]` and `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The values for `j` and `k` are 1 and 3, respectively. 

So, the values being affected are `dp[1][1][3]` which is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`. The other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3; dp[1][1][3] is assigned the value of dp[1][1][3].**
