The values of the variables do not change, but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `k` is unchanged; `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
