According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `k` and `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3.**
