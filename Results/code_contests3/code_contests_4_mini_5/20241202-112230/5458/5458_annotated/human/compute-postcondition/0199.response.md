The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the 3D list `dp` at the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`. Specifically, it sets the value at the position determined by the expression `i + 1 & 1` (which takes the result of `i + 1` and performs a bitwise AND operation with 1), `j + 1`, and `k` to 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, so we cannot specify exact indices. 

Since other variables or states are not affected, the output state will summarize the operation performed on the `dp` list. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
