The `continue` statement does not change any variable values, but it skips the remainder of the current iteration in the loop where it is executed, moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State reflects that the loop continues without any changes to the variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 1, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4; `dp[1][5][1]` is now equal to `dp[1][4][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
