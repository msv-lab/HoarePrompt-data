According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop iterates for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. 

Since `k` is currently 1, the next value of `k` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2 (which it is, since `s` is at least 3).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
