According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 (the starting value), and `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Since `k` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` will need to be 2. As `k` can take values from 1 to `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
