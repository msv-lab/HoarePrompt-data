Since the `while` loop is a `while 1` loop, it will always execute indefinitely. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is `N^2`; `j` is `m + 1`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp` has been fully updated based on all iterations for all values from 1 to `m` and 1 to `s`; the value printed is `dp[N^2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod**
