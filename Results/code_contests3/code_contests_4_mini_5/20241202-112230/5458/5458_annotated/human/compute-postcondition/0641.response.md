Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][2][-1] % mod.***
