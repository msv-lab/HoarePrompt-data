According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. Therefore, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
