The provided code snippet appears to be an indexed assignment involving a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The specific variable `j` is not defined in the initial state, which impacts the result. However, the operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

In this case, `i` is 2, and `k` is 3. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which results in 1 because `3` in binary is `11`, and `1` is `01`, so the bitwise AND operation gives `01` (or 1 in decimal). 

Therefore, the output state after executing the code snippet indicates that we are accessing elements of the `dp` array based on the calculated indices, but the value of `j` is unknown.

The values of `N`, `s`, and `k` remain unaffected in this specific operation.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][3]` (where `j` is undefined).**
