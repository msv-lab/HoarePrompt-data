The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop, if present, and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that no changes have been made to the variable values, and we remain in the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
