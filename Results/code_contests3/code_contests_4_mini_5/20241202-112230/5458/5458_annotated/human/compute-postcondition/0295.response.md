Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is `m + 1` where `m < s`; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no action is taken as there is no else part.***
