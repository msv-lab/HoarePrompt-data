Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1, otherwise there is no change. If `i` is not 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
