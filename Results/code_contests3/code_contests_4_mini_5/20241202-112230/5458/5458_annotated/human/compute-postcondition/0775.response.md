Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][1][0] % mod.***
