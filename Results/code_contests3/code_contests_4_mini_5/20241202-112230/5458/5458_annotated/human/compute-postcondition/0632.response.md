The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the position indexed by `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Given the initial values:
- `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`.
- `j` is `2`, so `j + 1` is `3`.
- `k` is `1`.

Now, we need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1`, which means we perform a bitwise AND operation between `1` (the result of `i + 1`) and `1`. The result of `1 & 1` is `1`.

Using these values, we can now determine the index:
- `dp[1][3][1]` will be assigned the value `1`.

The other variables `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.**
