In the given code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves an assignment operation using a multi-dimensional structure (likely a 3D array or list). 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. Therefore, `1 & 1` equals `1`. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
  
2. The value of `j + 1` is computed next. Since `j` is `2`, `j + 1` equals `3`.

3. The variable `k` is `3`, so it remains unchanged.

4. The left side of the assignment is `dp[1][3][3]`, and the right side is `dp[1][2][3]`.

5. The output does not specify the values stored in the `dp` structure, but we are simply assigning the value at `dp[1][2][3]` to `dp[1][3][3]`. 

Given that the values in `dp` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact values that are moved. However, the state of `N`, `i`, `j`, and `k` are unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we assign `dp[1][3][3] = dp[1][2][3]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we assign `dp[1][3][3] = dp[1][2][3]`.**
