Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is either 0 or 2; `s` is at least 7; `k` is 2; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][5][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, we skip to the next iteration of the loop, and `dp[1][5][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][4][2] % mod`.***
