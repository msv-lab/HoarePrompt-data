According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` iterates from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `j` is 2 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1 for the first execution. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1, and since it is stated that `N` is a positive integer with a maximum of 7, we can keep `N` as is. `k` starts at 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` must be at least 1**
