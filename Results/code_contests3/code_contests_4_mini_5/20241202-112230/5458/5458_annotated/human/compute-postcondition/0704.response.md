Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute the second time `m` must be at least 4. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][1]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
