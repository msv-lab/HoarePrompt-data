Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7. If `i` is 0, then `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `dp` has been updated such that if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1] = 1`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[0][3][1]` is updated based on an operation with `dp[1][2][-1] % mod.`***
