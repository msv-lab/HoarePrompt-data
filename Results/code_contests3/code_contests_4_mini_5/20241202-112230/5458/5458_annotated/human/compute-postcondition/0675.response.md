According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 3, which means the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be at least 2 because `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**.
