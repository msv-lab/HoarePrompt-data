Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is either 0 or 2, `s` is at least 7, `k` is 2, `m` is at least 4, and `j` is 4. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the loop will continue executing as `s` must still be at least 7 for a second iteration.***
