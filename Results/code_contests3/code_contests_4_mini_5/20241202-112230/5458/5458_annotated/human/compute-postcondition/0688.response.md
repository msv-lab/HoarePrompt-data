The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since the specific loop context isn't provided, we can only conclude that the values of the variables do not change, but we are skipping the rest of the current iteration of the loop. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is now equal to `dp[1][3][3]`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
