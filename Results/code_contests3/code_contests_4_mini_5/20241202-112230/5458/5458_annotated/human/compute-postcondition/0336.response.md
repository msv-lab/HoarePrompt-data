The statement `continue` does not modify any variable values directly but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since we are inside a loop, the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
