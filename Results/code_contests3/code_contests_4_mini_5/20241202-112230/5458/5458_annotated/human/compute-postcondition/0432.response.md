Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
