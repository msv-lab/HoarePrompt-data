Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `j` is `m + 1`; `s` is at least 2; and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the behavior of the program is contingent upon the specified conditions related to `N`, `j`, and `i`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
