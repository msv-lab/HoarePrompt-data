The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 4, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3; dp[1][4][4] is assigned the value of dp[1][3][4] and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
