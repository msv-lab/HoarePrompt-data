According to the code, the for loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1. Since `s` is stated to be at least 3, it satisfies this condition. 

The loop will execute a second time if `k` is able to reach at least 2 on the second iteration. Given that `k` starts at 1 for the first execution, it will increment to 2 for the second execution.

The other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `m`, and `dp`) are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, but we note that for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 4. However, since we are only adjusting the states necessary for the loop to execute, we focus on `s` and `k`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `k` is correctly initialized and able to execute the loop body multiple times.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `m` must be at least 4**
