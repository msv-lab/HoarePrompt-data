The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block where the continue statement is located. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block.
