According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` in the range defined by `m`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Since `j` is currently equal to 1, in order for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 2 (since the loop will start with `j` at 1 and increment by 1 on each iteration).

After the current iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `k` is `s`; `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions for all values from 1 to `s`; for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2.**
