Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 5; `s` is at least 5; and `j` is 3. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `k - j` equals 2.***
