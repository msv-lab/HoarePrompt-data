According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 3. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3.

Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s`, and `s` is at least 3, the loop will execute again for `k` equal to 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `s` must be at least 3.**
