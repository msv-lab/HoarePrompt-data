According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
