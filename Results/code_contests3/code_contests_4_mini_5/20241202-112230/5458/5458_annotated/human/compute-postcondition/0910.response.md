According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 1, and `s` is at least 2. This means that the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute with `k` equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
