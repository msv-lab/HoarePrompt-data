The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, there are no values being modified or returned in this instance, and the context of the loop is not provided. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][4][1]` is now equal to `dp[1][3][1]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
