According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `s` must be at least 1. The initial states provided indicate that `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1, but do not restrict `s`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` is set to at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `k` will start at 1 when the loop begins.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1**
