The statement "continue" is used to skip the remaining iterations of the current loop and move to the next iteration. Since there are no variables being modified or returned, the output state is determined by the fact that we are continuing within a loop.

The values of the variables do not change, but the program will skip to the next iteration of the loop it is currently within. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2; `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
