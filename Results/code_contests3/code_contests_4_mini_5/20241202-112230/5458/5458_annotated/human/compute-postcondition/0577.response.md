The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves a few operations. 

1. The value of `i` is 3, so `i + 1` is 4. 
2. The operation `4 & 1` results in `0` because the binary representation of `4` is `100` and `1` is `001`, and the bitwise AND operation results in `000`.
3. The value of `j` is 4, so `j + 1` is 5.
4. The value of `k` is 3, which remains unchanged.

Thus, the assignment `dp[0][5][3] = 1` takes place, affecting the array `dp` at the specified indices but does not change the values of `N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, or `k`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[0][5][3]` is assigned the value 1.**
