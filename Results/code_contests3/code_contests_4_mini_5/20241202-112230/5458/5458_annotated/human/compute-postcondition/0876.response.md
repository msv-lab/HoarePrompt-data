Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s` which is at least 1, and if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
