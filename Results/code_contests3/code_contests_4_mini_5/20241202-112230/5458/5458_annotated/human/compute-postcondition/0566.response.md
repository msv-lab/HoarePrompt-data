Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is reset to 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 4. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[4][5][1]` is updated from `dp[3][4][-3] % mod`.***
