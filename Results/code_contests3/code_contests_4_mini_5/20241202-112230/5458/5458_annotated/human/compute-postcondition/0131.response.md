Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][k]` is updated to `dp[1][3][k] + dp[0][2][0] % mod`.***
