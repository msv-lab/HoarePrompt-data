The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
