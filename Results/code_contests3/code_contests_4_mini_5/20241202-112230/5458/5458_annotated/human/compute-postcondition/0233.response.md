According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2, allowing `k` to take the value of 3 in the next iteration.

Thus, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `k` is now 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 2**
