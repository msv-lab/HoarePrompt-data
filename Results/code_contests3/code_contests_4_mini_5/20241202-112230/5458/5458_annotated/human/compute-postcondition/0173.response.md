Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `k` is 4 for the loop to execute a second time; `s` is at least 4. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
