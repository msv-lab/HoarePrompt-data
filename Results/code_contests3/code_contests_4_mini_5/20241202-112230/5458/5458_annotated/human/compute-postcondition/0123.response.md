According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` can take a value from 1 to `s`, then the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` becomes 2. Additionally, since `s` is at least 1, it allows for `k` to potentially take this new value.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
