According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, the variable `j` needs to be adjusted to ensure it reflects the current iteration of the loop. Since `j` starts at `m + 1`, it indicates that the loop has not executed yet, and it is currently set to the value that would terminate the loop on the first iteration. 

To execute the loop a second time, `j` should be at least 2 (assuming `m` is at least 1 to allow for at least one iteration), meaning that after the first iteration, it would be incremented by the loop construct. The conditions prior to the second execution would require `m` to be at least 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` has incremented to 2 after the first execution. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` is at least 1**
