The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in this assignment:
- `i` is not equal to 0.
- `j` is `m + 1`, where `m < s`.
- `k` is equal to `s`.
- The condition states that `j` is greater than `k`.

The values of `dp` are not specified, but the operation modifies the state of `dp`. Other variables `N`, `s`, and `m` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is `m + 1` where `m < s`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is `m + 1` where `m < s`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
