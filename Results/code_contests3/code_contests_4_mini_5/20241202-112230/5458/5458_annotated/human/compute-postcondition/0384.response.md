According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. Additionally, `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is `s`, and `dp` has been updated based on the conditions for all values from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
