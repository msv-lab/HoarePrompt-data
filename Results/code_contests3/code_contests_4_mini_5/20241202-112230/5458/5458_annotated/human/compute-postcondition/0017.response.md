The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, which skips the current iteration of the loop it is within. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
