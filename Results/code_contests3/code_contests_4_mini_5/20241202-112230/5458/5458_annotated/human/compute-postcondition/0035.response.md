The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 0; `j` is either 1 or 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
