According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Since `s` is at least 2, it satisfies the condition for the loop to continue.

So, at the beginning of the next iteration, `k` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3 (to ensure that `k` remains within bounds).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
