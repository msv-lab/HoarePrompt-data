According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The variable `k` is currently 2, which means that the loop has executed for `k = 1` and `k = 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. 

Given that `s` is at least 2, `s + 1` is at least 3, allowing for the loop to execute for `k = 3`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 3, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time.**
