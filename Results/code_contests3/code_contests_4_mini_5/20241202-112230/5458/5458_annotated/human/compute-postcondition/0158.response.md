Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is 3, `m` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2, resulting in `dp[1][4][2]` being set to 1. If `i` is 2, then `dp[3][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[3][3][2] % mod`.***
