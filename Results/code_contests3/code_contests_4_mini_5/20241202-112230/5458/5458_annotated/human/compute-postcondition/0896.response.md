According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

As `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be increased to 2. Therefore, `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, `s` is the total number of iterations executed, `k` is equal to `s`**
