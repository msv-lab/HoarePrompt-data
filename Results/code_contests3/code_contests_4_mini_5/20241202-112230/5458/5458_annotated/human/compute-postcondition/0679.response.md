The value of the variables does not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is within. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
