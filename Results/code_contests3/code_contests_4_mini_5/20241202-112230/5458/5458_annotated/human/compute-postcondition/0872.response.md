The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop in which we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is `s`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is still equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] while we continue to the next iteration.
