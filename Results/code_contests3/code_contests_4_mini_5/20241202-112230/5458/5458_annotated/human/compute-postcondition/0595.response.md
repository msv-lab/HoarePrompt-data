The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `i` is 3; `j` is 5; `s` is at least 3; `k` is equal to `s`; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
