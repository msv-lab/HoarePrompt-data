According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. The loop will execute one more time for the second time if `k` is incremented by 1, which makes `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `k` is 2, `s` is at least 2**
