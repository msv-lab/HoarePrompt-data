According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it can execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is at least 2, `k` can be incremented. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
