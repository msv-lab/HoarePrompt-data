According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4 (i.e., `m` must be greater than or equal to 4). After incrementing `j`, it will be 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 4.**
