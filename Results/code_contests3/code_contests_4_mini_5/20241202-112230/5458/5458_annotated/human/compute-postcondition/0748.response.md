Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `s` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time; `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, assignment takes place in `dp` at indices determined by `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
