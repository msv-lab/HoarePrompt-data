The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific element in the `dp` array. The variables affected are `i`, `j`, and `k`. Given the initial state, `i` is `0`, `j` is `m + 1` (where `m` is an unspecified positive integer), and `k` is `2`.

1. Calculate `i + 1 & 1`: 
   - `i + 1` is `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.
   - The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in `1`.

2. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j` is `m + 1`. Therefore, `j + 1` is `(m + 1) + 1`, which equals `m + 2`.

3. The value of `k` remains `2`.

Thus, the expression modifies the `dp` array at the index `[1][m + 2][2]`, setting it to `1`. The other variables (`N`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][m + 2][2]` is set to 1.**
