The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
