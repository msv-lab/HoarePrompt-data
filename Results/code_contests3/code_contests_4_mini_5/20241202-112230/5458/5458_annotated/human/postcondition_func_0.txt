The function processes multiple datasets of positive integers `N`, `M`, and `S`, where the input ends when all three values are zero. For each dataset, it computes a value based on a dynamic programming approach using the parameters `N`, `M`, and `S`, and prints the result modulo 100,000. The function does not accept parameters directly and can handle up to 5 datasets. If the input values exceed their specified ranges or if the input consists solely of zeros, it terminates the process without further action.
