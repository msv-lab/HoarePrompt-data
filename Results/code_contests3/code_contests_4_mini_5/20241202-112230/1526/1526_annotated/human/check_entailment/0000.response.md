Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the specified behavior for determining if the string `w` is beautiful according to the problem description. The main issues are:

1. **Input Method**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This could lead to a runtime error when executed in Python 3.

2. **Counting Logic**: The logic for counting characters is correct; it counts the occurrences of each character in the input string. However, it does not handle the case where the string length is between 1 and 100. Although the description states that `w` will always conform to these constraints, the program lacks input validation to ensure this.

3. **Output Formatting**: While the program prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the result, the specification in the problem description states that it should print `Yes` or `No` (case-sensitive), which could be considered correct in terms of words used but does not affect the logic.

4. **Function Structure**: The function does not accept parameters directly, which means it cannot be tested with different strings without modifying the code. This does not strictly follow good programming practices since it makes it less reusable.

Overall, the primary reason it does not meet the problem description is the input method and lack of flexibility in function design.
