According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the variable `c`. If `c` is an element in `s`, the loop can execute again for the next character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, and `memo` contains the key `c` with its value incremented by 1 if `c` was already present, or it remains as `{c: 0}` if `c` was not previously in `memo`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the position of `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is the current character, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be the next character in `s`. This means we need to increment the index of the loop iteration.

Therefore, we need to adjust our state to reflect that we have moved to the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `memo` contains the key `c` with the value incremented by 1 if `c` was already present, or remains as `{c: 0}`; for the loop to execute a second time, `c` must be the next character in the string `s`**.
