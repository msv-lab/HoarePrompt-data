`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`, where `c` is the first character of `s` and is not a key in `memo`. This means that `memo` now contains a new entry with `c` as the key and `0` as its value. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` now contains the key `c` with the value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`.
Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` now contains the key `c` with the value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
