The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string from the user. The variable `w` remains unchanged as it is a string consisting of lowercase letters. Therefore, the output state reflects that `w` is a string of lowercase letters, and `s` is an input string.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is an input string**
