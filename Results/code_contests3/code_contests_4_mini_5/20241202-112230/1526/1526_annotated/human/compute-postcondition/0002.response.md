According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. The variable `w` being a string consisting of lowercase letters and `memo` being an empty dictionary does not affect the execution of the loop itself. For the loop to be executed the first time, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `c` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
