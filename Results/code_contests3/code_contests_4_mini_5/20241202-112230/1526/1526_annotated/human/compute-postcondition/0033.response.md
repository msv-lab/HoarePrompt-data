The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100. It counts the occurrences of each character in the string and checks if all character counts are even. If all counts are even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. 

However, the annotations incorrectly suggest that it accepts a parameter `w`, while in reality, it reads the input directly using `raw_input()`. Additionally, the function does not handle any edge cases related to input validation or non-string inputs, as it directly assumes the input will be a valid string of lowercase letters. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input of lowercase letters, counts the occurrences of each character, and prints 'Yes' if all counts are even and 'No' if any count is odd. It does not accept parameters directly and lacks input validation for non-string inputs. **
