The code initializes an empty dictionary `memo`. The initial state of the variables `w` and `s` remains unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment of `memo`. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is an input string; `memo` is an empty dictionary**
