Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. Additionally, the program does not explicitly handle cases where the input might not be strictly lowercase letters, although the problem description states that `w` consists of lowercase letters. 

Furthermore, while the logic to count character occurrences and check if they are even is correct, the program does not have any input validation, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not conform to the specified constraints.

To summarize, the program fails in the following aspects:
1. It uses `raw_input()` instead of `input()`, making it incompatible with Python 3.
2. There is no validation for input, even though the problem constraints guarantee lowercase letters only.

These issues prevent the program from fully complying with the problem description in all potential cases.
