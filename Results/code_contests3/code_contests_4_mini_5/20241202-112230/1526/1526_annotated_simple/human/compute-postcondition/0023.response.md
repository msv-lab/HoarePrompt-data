The code assigns the value `False` to the variable `result`. The previous state of `result` was also `False`, so after execution, the value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, for the loop to execute a second time `memo` must have at least 2 values, and `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`.
