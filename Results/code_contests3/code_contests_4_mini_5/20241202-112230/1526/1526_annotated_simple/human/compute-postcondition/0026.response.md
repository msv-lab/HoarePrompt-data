According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `memo`. The loop iterates over the values in `memo`, and for it to execute again, `memo` must have at least 3 values (since it currently has at least 2). At the end of the last iteration, `memo` has at least 2 values, and `result` is False. We need to increase `x` to the next value in `memo.values()`. 

If `x` is the second value in `memo.values()` and is odd, we will break out of the loop, so for the loop to execute a second time, `memo` must have at least 3 values, and `x` must be the third value in `memo.values()`. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, for the loop to execute a second time `memo` must have at least 3 values, and `x` is the third value in `memo.values()`**
