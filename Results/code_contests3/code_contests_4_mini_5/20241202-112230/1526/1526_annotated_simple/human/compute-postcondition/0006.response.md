The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not in `memo`, it was initialized to 0 before this line, and now it would become 1. If `c` was already in `memo`, its previous value is increased by 1. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. The output state will reflect the new value of `memo[c]`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value incremented by 1.**
