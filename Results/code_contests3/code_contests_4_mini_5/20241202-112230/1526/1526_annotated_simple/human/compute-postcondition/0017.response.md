According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. The loop will execute for each value in `memo.values()`. Since `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, it is assumed that `memo` is not empty because it is derived from the non-empty string `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `x` will take on the first value from `memo.values()`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `x` is the first value in memo.values()**
