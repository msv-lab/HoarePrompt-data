Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, `memo` must have at least 2 values for the loop to execute a second time, and if `x` (the second value in `memo.values()`) is odd, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
