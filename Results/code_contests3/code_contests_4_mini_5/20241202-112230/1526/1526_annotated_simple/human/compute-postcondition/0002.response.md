According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. The variable `w`, having a length between 1 and 100, does not affect the execution of the loop directly. At the start of the loop, `c` will take on the value of the first character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `c` will be the first character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
