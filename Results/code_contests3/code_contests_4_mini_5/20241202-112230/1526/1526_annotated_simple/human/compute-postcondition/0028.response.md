The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, for the loop to execute a second time `memo` must have at least 3 values, and `x` is the third value in `memo.values()`; `result` remains False and we break out of the most internal loop.
