Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, and for the loop to execute a second time, `memo` must have at least 3 values. If `x` is the third value in `memo.values()` and `x` is odd (`x % 2 > 0`), then `result` remains False and the most internal loop is exited.***
