The variable `memo` is updated by assigning a value of `0` to the key `c`. Since `c` is the first character of `s` and is not already a key in `memo`, it is added to the dictionary with the specified value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is the first character of `s**.
