According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values in `memo`. The loop iterates over the values of `memo`, and if there are more values to iterate over, it can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `result` is False, which indicates that the loop has either exited without meeting a certain condition or has processed the current value of `x` (the first value in `memo.values()` which is an odd integer). 

Since `x` is the first value, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next value in `memo.values()`. Therefore, if there are additional values present in `memo` after the first value, the loop will continue. 

Assuming there is at least one more value in `memo`, the next value of `x` will be the second value of `memo.values()`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, for the loop to execute a second time `memo` must have at least 2 values, and `x` is the second value in `memo.values()`**
