Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. If `c`, the first character of `s`, is not in `memo`, then `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`. If `c` is already in `memo`, no changes are made to `memo`.***
