The loop processes each character in the string `s` and counts the occurrences of each character, storing this information in the dictionary `memo`. If a character is encountered for the first time, it is added to `memo` with an initial count of 0, which is then incremented by 1. The loop will iterate for each character in `s`, hence `memo` will contain all unique characters from `s` along with their respective counts.

If `s` is a non-empty string, after all iterations of the loop, `memo` will contain keys for each unique character found in `s`, with their values indicating the total counts of those characters. 

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains keys for each unique character in `s` with their values representing the count of occurrences of those characters.**
