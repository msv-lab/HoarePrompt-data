According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `memo` has a key `c` with a value incremented by 1, which means that the loop has processed the character `c` from `s`. 

The loop currently iterates over the characters in `s`, and since `s` is non-empty, there are more characters to process. If `c` is the character being processed in the last iteration, the next character will be the next character in `s`.

To execute one more time, the loop will need to process the next character in `s`. If the length of `s` is `len(s)`, and the loop has processed `c` at index `i`, then for the loop to execute a second time, `c` must be the character at index `i + 1` in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be the character at the next index in `s`.**
