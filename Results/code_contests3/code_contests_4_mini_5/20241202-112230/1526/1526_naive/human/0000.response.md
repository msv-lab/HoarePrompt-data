Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly handle cases where the input string contains characters that appear an odd number of times. Specifically, the logic in the program uses `if x % 2 > 0` to check for odd occurrences, which is correct, but it does not properly handle the case where the string is empty or contains only one character. 

For example:
- Input: `"a"` would output `"Yes"` when it should output `"No"` since the single character `'a'` occurs only once (odd number of times).
- Input: `"abc"` would also output `"Yes"` when it should output `"No"` since all characters appear only once (again, odd number of times).

Thus, there are potential cases where the program does not work correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct according to the problem description.
