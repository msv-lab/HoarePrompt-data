To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we first analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description
The task is to check if a string `w` is "beautiful," meaning every lowercase letter appears an even number of times.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` using `raw_input()`. This function is used in Python 2. In Python 3, it should be `input()`. If this is intended for Python 3, it will fail.
2. **Counting Characters**: The program uses a dictionary `memo` to count occurrences of each character. This part of the logic is correct, as it initializes each character's count and increments it accordingly.
3. **Checking Even Counts**: The program checks if each character count is even. If any character has an odd count, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" if `result` is `True` (meaning all characters have even counts) and "No" otherwise.

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Character Input**: For example, the string "a" should return "No" because 'a' appears once (odd count).
2. **All Characters Even**: A string like "aabbcc" should return "Yes".
3. **Mixed Characters**: A string like "aabbc" should return "No" since 'c' appears once (odd count).
4. **Empty String**: Although the constraints specify that the length of `w` is at least 1, it's worth noting that an empty string would be a special case if it were allowed.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function checks if all characters in the string appear an even number of times and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. This aligns with the logic provided in the code.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code against the problem description and considering potential edge cases, the following points arise:

- The code adequately counts character occurrences and checks for even counts.
- It fails to account for the input method if intended for Python 3, which could lead to execution errors.
- The logic for determining "beautiful" strings is correctly implemented.

Thus, given that the program does not handle the input correctly in Python 3, it does not satisfy the problem description accurately in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle the input method for Python 3, which can cause it to fail during execution.
