According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. Since `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and `memo` is an empty dictionary, these states do not influence the execution of the loop directly. The variable `c` will take on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

To ensure that the loop can execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the string `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `c` is the first character of `s`.**
