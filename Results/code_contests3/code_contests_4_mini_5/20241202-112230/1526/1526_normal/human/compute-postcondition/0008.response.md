The value of `memo[c]` is assigned 0, which means it remains unchanged as it was already 0. The previous state of `memo[c]` does not change since it is already set to 0. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the second character of `s` having a value of 0. 

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the second character of `s` having a value of 0.**
