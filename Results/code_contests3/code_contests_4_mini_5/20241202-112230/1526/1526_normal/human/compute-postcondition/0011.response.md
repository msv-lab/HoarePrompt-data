According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character, and the loop can continue to execute as long as there are characters left in `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is non-empty, and `memo` has been updated based on the presence of character `c`. If `c` is the last character in `s`, then for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in `s`.

If the loop has executed for the last character of `s`, then the next character `c` would be the next character in the string `s`, and `memo` will be updated accordingly for that character.

Therefore, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must have at least one more character, `c` is the next character in the string `s` not yet processed, `memo` is updated for `c`**.
