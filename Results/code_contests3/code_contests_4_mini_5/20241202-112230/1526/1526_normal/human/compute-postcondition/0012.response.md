The variable `memo` is updated to assign the value `0` for the key `c`. The variable `c` represents the next character in the string `s` that has not yet been processed. The previous states of the variables `w`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the dictionary `memo` is now updated for the character `c`. Therefore, the output state is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s` not yet processed, and `memo` is updated for `c` with the value `0`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s` not yet processed, and `memo[c]` is updated to 0.**
