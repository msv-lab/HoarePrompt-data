The value of `result` is assigned `False`, changing it from its previous value of `True`. Other variables (`w`, `s`, `memo`, and `x`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 character from `s` as keys, `result` is False, and `x` is an odd integer.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 1 character from `s` as keys, `result` is False, and `x` is an odd integer**.
