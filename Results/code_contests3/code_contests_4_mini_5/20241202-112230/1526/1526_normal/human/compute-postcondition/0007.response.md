According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 where `c` is the first character of `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, there are still characters left to iterate through. 

If `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, at the end of the last iteration the loop has processed the first character of `s` (which is `c`). For the loop to execute one more time, it will move to the next character in the string `s`. 

Since `memo[c]` has been incremented by 1, `c` does not change, but we need to consider the next character in `s`. Therefore, if the loop has processed the first character, we will continue with the next character in `s` which we can denote as `s[1]`. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will show that `c` has shifted to the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with `c` as the second character of `s` having a value of 0, now `memo[c]` is incremented by 1.**
