According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of the `memo` dictionary, specifically its values. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an even integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` will take the next value from `memo.values()`. 

Since `memo` has at least 1 additional character from `s` as keys, and we are iterating over its values, we need to ensure that there is at least one more value available in `memo` for the loop to continue executing. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is even, so for the loop to execute again, `x` will become the next value from `memo.values()`, which must also be an even integer. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 additional characters from `s` as keys, `result` is False, and `x` is the next even integer from `memo.values()`**
