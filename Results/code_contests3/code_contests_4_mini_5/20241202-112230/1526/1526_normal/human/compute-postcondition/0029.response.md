Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least 2 additional characters from `s` as keys, `result` is False, and `x` is the next even integer from `memo.values()`. If `x` is odd, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
