Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters (with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive) and checks if all characters in the string appear an even number of times. It prints 'Yes' if all characters have even counts; otherwise, it prints 'No'. There is no return value from the function. **
