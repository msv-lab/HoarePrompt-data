The loop checks each value in the `memo` dictionary to determine if all counts are even. If any count is odd, it sets `result` to False and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding an odd count, `result` remains True.

If `memo` contains only even counts after all iterations, `result` will still be True. If `memo` has at least one odd count, `result` will be False.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with characters from `s` as keys and their counts as values, `result` is False if there is at least one odd count in `memo.values()`, otherwise `result` is True.**
