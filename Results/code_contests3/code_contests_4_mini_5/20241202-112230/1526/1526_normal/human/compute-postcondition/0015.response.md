The loop iterates through each character in the string `s` and updates the dictionary `memo` to count the occurrences of each character. After all iterations, `memo` will contain each unique character from `s` as keys, with their respective counts as values. 

Since `s` is a non-empty string as per the initial state, the loop will execute for each character in `s`. The final state will reflect the total counts of all characters from `s` in `memo`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary with characters from `s` as keys and their counts as values.**
