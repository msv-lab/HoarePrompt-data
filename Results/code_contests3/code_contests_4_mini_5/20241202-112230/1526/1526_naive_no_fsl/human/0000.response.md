To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic within the program and see if it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads a string input `s`.
2. It uses a dictionary (`memo`) to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
3. It then checks if each character count is even.
4. If all character counts are even, it prints "Yes", otherwise it prints "No".

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the case where the string is empty. According to the constraints, the length of `w` is at least 1, so this should not affect the current implementation.
- If the string contains characters with even counts and one character with an odd count, the program should correctly identify this.
- The program should also handle strings where all characters are the same (e.g., "aaaa").

### Testing Examples:
- For the input `"abaccaba"`, the counts are: `{'a': 4, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}`. All counts are even, so the output is "Yes".
- For the input `"hthth"`, the counts are: `{'h': 2, 't': 3}`. The count for 't' is odd, so the output is "No".
- For input `"aa"`, the counts are: `{'a': 2}`. All counts are even, so the output is "Yes".
- For input `"a"`, the counts are: `{'a': 1}`. The count for 'a' is odd, so the output is "No".

### Conclusion:
After considering the problem description and testing various cases, the program correctly identifies whether the string is beautiful based on the provided conditions. 

Correctness: **True** 

The program accurately counts the occurrences of each character and checks if those counts are even, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
