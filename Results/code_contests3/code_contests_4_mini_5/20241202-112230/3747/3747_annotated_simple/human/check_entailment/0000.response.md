Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why it fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Hardcoded Output for n = 11**: The program contains a conditional check that specifically checks if `n` is equal to 11 and, if so, it prints `5`. This is an arbitrary behavior that does not align with the general requirement of distributing coins into pockets based on their values.

2. **Counting Coin Occurrences**: The program correctly counts the occurrences of each coin value in the list `a` using the array `c`. However, it only prints `max(c)`, which gives the maximum number of times any single coin value appears in the list. This does not represent the minimum number of pockets required to distribute the coins without placing two coins of the same value in the same pocket. The correct approach should involve determining how many unique coin values there are, as the number of pockets required is dictated by the maximum frequency of any coin value.

3. **Missing General Case Handling**: The program does not handle cases where `n` is not equal to 11. For any other input, the program does not produce a meaningful output, which means it cannot be relied upon for the general cases described in the problem.

In summary, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements for all potential cases, particularly due to the hardcoded condition and incorrect logic for determining the number of pockets needed. Therefore, it is not correct.
