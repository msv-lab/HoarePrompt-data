The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the value of `n` or `a`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of input integers; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of input integers; `c` is a list of 101 zeros**.
