`c[d]` is the element at index `d` of the list `c`, which is increased by 1. The value of `d` is the second element of the list `a`. The list `c` is initialized with 101 integers, and `d` will be in the range of indices available in `c`, which is valid since `n` is between 1 and 100. Therefore, the state of the variable `c` changes at index `d`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of input integers with at least 2 elements; `c` has been updated at index `d`, where `d` is the second element of `a`.**
