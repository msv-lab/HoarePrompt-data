The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer `a[i]` also satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. After executing the function body, it processes the list of integers `a` based on the specified conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers, ensuring that `n` is within the specified range and that all elements of `a` meet their respective constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100).**
