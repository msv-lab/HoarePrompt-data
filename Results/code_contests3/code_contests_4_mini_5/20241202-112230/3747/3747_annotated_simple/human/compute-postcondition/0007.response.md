The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. Since `d` is the first element of the list `a`, the specific value of `d` is an integer that corresponds to the first element in `a`. The list `c` is initially a list of 101 zeros, so only the index corresponding to the value of `d` in the list `c` will change, increasing that specific index by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with the index `d` increased by 1, `d` is the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of input integers with at least 1 element, `c` is a list of 101 integers with index `d` increased by 1, `d` is the first element of `a**
