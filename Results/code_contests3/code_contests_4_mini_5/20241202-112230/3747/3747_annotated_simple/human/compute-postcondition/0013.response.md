The code snippet `print(max(c))` is executed, which finds the maximum value in the list `c`. The initial state indicates that `c` is a list of 101 integers where each index corresponds to the count of occurrences of integers from the list `a`, and all other indices are initialized to 0. 

Thus, the output will depend on the counts stored in `c`. Since `c` can contain values greater than 0 depending on the occurrences of the integers in `a`, the maximum value in `c` will reflect the highest count of any integer present in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of input integers with at least `n` elements; `c` is a list of counts, and the maximum value in `c` is the highest count of occurrences of any integer in `a`.**
