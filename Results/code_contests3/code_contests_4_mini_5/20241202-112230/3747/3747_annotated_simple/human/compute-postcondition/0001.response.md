`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `raw_input().split()`, which means `a` will hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The previous value of `n` does not affect the assignment of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of input integers**
