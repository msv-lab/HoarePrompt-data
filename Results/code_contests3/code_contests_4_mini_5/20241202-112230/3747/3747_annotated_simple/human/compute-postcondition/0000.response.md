The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and this condition will be maintained after the assignment. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and it is now assigned a new input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and it is now assigned a new input integer**.
