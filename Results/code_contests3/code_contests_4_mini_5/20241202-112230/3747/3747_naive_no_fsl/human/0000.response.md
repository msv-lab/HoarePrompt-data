To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Analysis
Polycarp wants to distribute coins into pockets such that no two coins with the same value are in the same pocket. The goal is to find the minimum number of pockets required for this distribution, given the values of the coins.

### Code Analysis
```python
n = int(raw_input())
a = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))
if n == 11:
    print(5)
c = [0] * 101
for d in a:
    c[d] += 1
print(max(c))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The first input reads the number of coins, `n`, and the second input reads the values of the coins into the list `a`.
   
2. **Special Case**: The line `if n == 11: print(5)` seems to handle a specific edge case where if there are exactly 11 coins, it directly returns 5 pockets. This is not justified or explained in the problem statement and seems arbitrary.

3. **Counting Coin Frequencies**: The program initializes a list `c` of size 101 (to handle coin values from 1 to 100) to count the occurrences of each coin value.

4. **Finding Maximum Frequency**: The program iterates through the list of coins `a`, incrementing the count for each coin's value in `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum count found in `c`, which represents the minimum number of pockets needed.

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Input**: For the input `6` and `1 2 4 3 3 2`, the expected output is `2`. The program calculates the maximum frequency of any coin, which is correct for this case.

2. **Special Case**: For `11` coins, the program returns `5` without justification. However, there are no conditions in the problem statement that specify any particular handling for 11 coins. This means that the program has an incorrect output for potentially valid inputs.

3. **Single Coin**: For `1` and `100`, the output should be `1`, which the program correctly handles.

4. **Edge Case**: If we take an input like `5` and `2 2 2 2 2`, the expected output is `1`, but the program will correctly output `5` because it counts the maximum frequency of coin value `2`. This indicates the program may give an incorrect answer in some scenarios.

### Conclusion
The program contains a hardcoded response for a specific case (`n == 11`) without justification, and it does not accurately calculate the minimum number of pockets needed in all scenarios, especially when there are multiple coins of the same value.

Thus, since the program does not reliably satisfy the problem's requirements for every input case, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
