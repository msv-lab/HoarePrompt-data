`c[d]` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the first element in the list `a`. Since `d` is an integer in the range of 0 to 100 (because `a` contains integers that are bounded by the constraints), the corresponding index in the list `c` will be affected. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes the updated value of `c[d]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers where `c[d]` is incremented by 1, and `d` is the first element in `a`.**
