The code prints the maximum value from the list `c`, which contains counts of occurrences of integers from the list `a`. The variable `c` is already defined in the initial state, and its values represent the counts of integers in `a`. The maximum value of `c` will depend on the specific counts of occurrences in `a`, but we do not have those specific counts. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that we are printing the maximum count.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers, and we print the maximum value from `c`.**
