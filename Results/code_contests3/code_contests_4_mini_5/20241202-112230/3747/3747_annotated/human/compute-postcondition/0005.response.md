The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, but the initialization of `c` does not affect these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `a`, along with the new list `c`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of 101 zeros.**
