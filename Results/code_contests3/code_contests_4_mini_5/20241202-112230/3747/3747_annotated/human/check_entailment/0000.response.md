Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Handling of specific case (n == 11)**: The program includes a specific conditional check for when `n` is equal to 11, which prints 5. This is arbitrary and does not align with the problem statement that requires calculating the minimum number of pockets needed based on the coin distribution.

2. **Counting occurrences**: The program counts the occurrences of each coin value using an array `c`, where `c[i]` represents the count of value `i` in the list `a`. While this part of the program is correct in terms of counting how many times each coin value appears, it does not determine the minimum number of pockets needed directly from this count.

3. **Output**: The program simply prints the maximum count of occurrences of any coin value. This maximum count represents how many coins of the same value exist, which indeed indicates how many pockets are necessary for that specific value, but it does not account for the overall distribution of all coin values. It does not check if the total distribution can be managed with fewer pockets.

4. **Example not covered**: The program would fail for cases not equal to 11 and would provide incorrect results for other distributions of coin values. For instance, if the input is `6` and the coins are `1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2`, the maximum occurrences are 2 (for the values 2 and 3), which suggests that 2 pockets are needed, but the program does not systematically ensure it handles all values correctly.

Therefore, due to these issues, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements as described.
