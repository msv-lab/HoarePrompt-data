The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, each ranging from 1 to 100. If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a` and prints the maximum count found. The function does not return any value; it only prints results.
