The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 100, inclusive. It prints 5 if `n` is equal to 11 and then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`, printing the maximum count of any integer in the list after processing. If no integers are present in `a`, the maximum count will be 0. There is no handling of cases where `n` is not equal to the size of the list `a`, which could lead to unexpected results if input constraints are violated.
