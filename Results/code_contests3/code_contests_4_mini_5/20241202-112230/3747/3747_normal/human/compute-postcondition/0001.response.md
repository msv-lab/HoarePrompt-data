The code assigns the variable `a` to be a list of integers obtained from the input. The function `raw_input()` reads a line of input, which is then split into separate strings. The `map(int, ...)` function converts each of these strings into an integer, and `list(...)` constructs a list from these integers. The value of `n` determines how many integers will be stored in the list `a`. The initial state of `n` and the constraints on `a_i` remain applicable. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100 based on the input.**
