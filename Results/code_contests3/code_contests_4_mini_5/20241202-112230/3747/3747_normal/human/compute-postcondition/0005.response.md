The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the list `a`. After execution, `c` will hold a list of zeros, while `n` and `a` retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.**
