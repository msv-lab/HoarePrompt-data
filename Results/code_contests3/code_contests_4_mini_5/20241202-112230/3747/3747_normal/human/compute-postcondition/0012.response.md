The loop counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a` and stores the counts in the list `c`. Each index `d` of list `c` corresponds to the value of the integers in `a`, and `c[d]` will contain the number of times `d` appears in `a`. After all iterations of the loop, `c` will reflect the frequency of each integer from 1 to 100 that appears in `a`.

If `a` contains integers between 1 and 100, then after the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be updated to show how many times each integer appears in `a`. If an integer does not appear in `a`, the corresponding index in `c` will remain 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers where `c[i]` is the count of integer `i` in `a` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ 100` and `c[0]` remains 0.**
