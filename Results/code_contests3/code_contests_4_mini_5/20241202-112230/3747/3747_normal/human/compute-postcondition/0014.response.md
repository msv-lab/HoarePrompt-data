The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. Based on the provided output specifications, the function processes these inputs and returns a specific result based on the values in the list. 

However, since the specific output cases are not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in the list is between 1 and 100, inclusive.**
