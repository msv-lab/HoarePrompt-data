The code assigns the value of `n` from the input accepted by `raw_input()`, which is then converted to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, but the specific value is not provided. The variable `a` is not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100**
