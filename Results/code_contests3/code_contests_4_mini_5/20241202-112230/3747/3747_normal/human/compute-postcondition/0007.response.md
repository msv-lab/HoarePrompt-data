The value of `d` is assigned the value of `a[0]`, which is the first integer in the list `a`. The `c` list is indexed at `d`, and the value at that index is incremented by 1. Since `d` is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `c[d]` will have its value increased from 0 to 1 (since `c` is initialized with zeros). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of 101 integers where `c[d]` is 1, `d` is `a[0]`**.
