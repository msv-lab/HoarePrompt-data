The function reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of companies, and then for each company, it reads a list of integers where the first integer indicates the number of employees and the subsequent integers represent the employees' salaries. It calculates the maximum salary within each company's list, finds the overall maximum salary among all companies, and computes a total adjustment cost as the sum of the differences between this overall maximum salary and each company's maximum salary, multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it prints this total adjustment cost.
