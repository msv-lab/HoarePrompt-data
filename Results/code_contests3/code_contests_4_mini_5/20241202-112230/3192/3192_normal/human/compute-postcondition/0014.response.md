The variable `temp` is appended to the list `arr`. The previous state of `arr` is empty, so after execution, `arr` will contain the value of `temp`. Since `temp` is defined as the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the value of `temp` will depend on the contents of `arr1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
