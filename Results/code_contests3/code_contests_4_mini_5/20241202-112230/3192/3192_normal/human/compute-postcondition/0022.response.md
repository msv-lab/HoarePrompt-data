According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `arr1[0]`. The loop is set to run as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `arr1[0]` is an input integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1.

At this stage, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so it will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 and `j` will be 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is max(0, arr1[1]), `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
