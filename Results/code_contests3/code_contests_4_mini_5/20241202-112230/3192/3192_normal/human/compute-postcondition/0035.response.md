According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2. 

State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or remains 0; `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
