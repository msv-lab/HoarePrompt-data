According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is max(0, arr1[1]), `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
