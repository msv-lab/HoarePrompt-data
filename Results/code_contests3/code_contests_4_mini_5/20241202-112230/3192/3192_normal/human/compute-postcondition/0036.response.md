The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. The value of `arr1[j]` is the third element of `arr1`. Since `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or remains 0, and `arr1` contains at least one integer greater than 1, `temp` can potentially change based on the comparison.

If `arr1[2]` is greater than `temp`, then `temp` will be updated to this new maximum value. The values of the other variables, `maxval`, `n`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged, but they provide context for the operation being performed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
