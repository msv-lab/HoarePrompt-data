In the given code snippet, `temp` is assigned the value of `max(temp, arr1[j])`. 

- The current value of `temp` is already defined based on the initial state.
- The value of `j` is 2, which means we will be accessing `arr1[2]`.
- Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, we can infer that `arr1` contains at least 3 elements.
- We can calculate `arr1[2]`, but the specific value is not provided in the initial state.
- The value of `temp` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`.

The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the current values of the variables along with the updated value of `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 2**
