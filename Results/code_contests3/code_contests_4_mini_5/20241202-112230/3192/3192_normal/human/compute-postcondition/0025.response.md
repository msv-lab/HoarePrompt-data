The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 3, we need to consider the value of `arr1[3]`. The previous value of `temp` is `max(0, arr1[1])`, and the exact value of `arr1[3]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state captures the potential changes based on the maximum function. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is updated to max(max(0, arr1[1]), arr1[3]), `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
