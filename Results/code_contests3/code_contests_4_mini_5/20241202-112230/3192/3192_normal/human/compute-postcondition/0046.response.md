To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet, considering the initial values of the variables:

- `n` is a positive integer (its specific value is not given).
- `i` is 0.
- `ans` is 0.

In the code snippet, `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`:

1. We need to calculate the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`.
2. `i` is 0, so we look at `arr[0]` and `arr2[0]` but the specific values of `arr` and `arr2` are not provided.
3. The value of `maxval` is also not specified.

Since we don't have the specific values for `maxval`, `arr[0]`, and `arr2[0]`, we cannot compute a concrete value for `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]` to its current value (which is 0).

Thus, the output state will reflect the new value of `ans`, which will now depend on the unspecified values:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ans` is `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`**
