According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` in relation to `arr1[0]`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and continues while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 (as stated), the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

To execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 3**
