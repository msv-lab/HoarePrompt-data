According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `maxval` has been updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value, but we need to focus on the loop control variable `i`. 

Given that the loop is currently on `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to run again, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `i + 1` and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`**
