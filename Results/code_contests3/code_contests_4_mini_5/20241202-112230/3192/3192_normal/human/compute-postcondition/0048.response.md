The value of `ans` is incremented by the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The previous value of `ans` was `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`, and since `i` is currently 1, we need to evaluate the expression using `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]`. The state of the other variables (`n` and `i`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and `ans` is updated to include the term `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and `ans` is updated to include the term `(maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`**
