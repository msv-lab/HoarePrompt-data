To analyze the output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, we observe that the loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`. During each iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `arr1[0]` must also be at least 1, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once.

After all iterations, the value of `temp` will be the maximum value found in the elements of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. Therefore, at the end of the loop:

- `n` remains an input integer greater than 0.
- `temp` will be the maximum of `arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`, ..., up to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.
- `maxval` is still the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0.
- `arr2` continues to contain `arr1[0]`.
- `i` remains 1.
- `j` will be equal to `arr1[0]` after the loop finishes since it will be incremented to exit the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`.**
