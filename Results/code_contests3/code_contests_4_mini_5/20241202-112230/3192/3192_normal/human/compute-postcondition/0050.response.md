The variable `ans` is increased by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The specific values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]` are not provided, but `i` is 2. The state of `ans` is modified, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by `(maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by `(maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`**
