The value of `arr1[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr1`, is appended to `arr2`. Since `arr2` is initially an empty list, after the execution, `arr2` will contain the value of `arr1[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
