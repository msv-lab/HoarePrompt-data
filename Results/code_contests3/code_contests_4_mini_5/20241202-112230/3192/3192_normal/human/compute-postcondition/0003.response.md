The variable `arr2` is assigned an empty list, but this does not affect any of the previous variables (`n`, `arr`, or `maxval`). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
