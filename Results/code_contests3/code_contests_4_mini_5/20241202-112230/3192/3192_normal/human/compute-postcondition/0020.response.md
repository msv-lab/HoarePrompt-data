According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the `xrange` function generates a sequence starting from 1 up to but not including `arr1[0]`. Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 0, it does not directly influence the loop execution. The variable `j` will start at 1.

At the beginning of the loop, since `i` is currently 1, it does not change the conditions for the loop execution. However, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` must be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
