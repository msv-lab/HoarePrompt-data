According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0]` is an integer greater than 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is max(temp, arr1[1]), `j` is 2**
