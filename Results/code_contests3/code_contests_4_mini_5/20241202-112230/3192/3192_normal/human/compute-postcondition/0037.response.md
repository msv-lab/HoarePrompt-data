According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

Since `j` is currently 2, and the loop starts from 1 up to but not including `arr1[0]`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to run a third time.

State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
