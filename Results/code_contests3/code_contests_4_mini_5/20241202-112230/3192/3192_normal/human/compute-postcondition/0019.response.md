The value of `temp` is assigned to 0, which means it will be reset to 0 regardless of its previous value. The other variables `n`, `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `i`, and `arr1` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0; `arr` contains `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers populated by input values; `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0; `arr` contains `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers populated by input values; `temp` is 0.**
