The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`. The value of `arr1[j]` is an integer from the list `arr1`, which has at least one integer greater than 1. Since `j` is initialized to 1, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of the list. The maximum function will determine the greater value between 0 and `arr1[1]`. 

Thus, after executing the line of code, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1; `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or remains 0; `j` is 1.**
