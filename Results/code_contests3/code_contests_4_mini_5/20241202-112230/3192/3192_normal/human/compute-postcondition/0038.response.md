Output State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one integer greater than 1; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 3; `arr1[0]` is greater than 3; therefore, `temp` is updated based on the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.**
