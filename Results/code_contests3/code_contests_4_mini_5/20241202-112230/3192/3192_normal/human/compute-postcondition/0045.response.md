According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as it is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `ans` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, the loop will execute `n` times, and `i` will need to be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
