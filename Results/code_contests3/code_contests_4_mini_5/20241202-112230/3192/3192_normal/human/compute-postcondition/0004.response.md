According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `arr` and `arr2` are both empty lists and do not affect the execution of the loop, we only need to focus on `n` and the variable `i`. Before the loop starts, `maxval` is set to 0, which does not affect the loop's execution either. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0. 

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
