`arr2` is updated by appending the value of `arr1[0]`. Since `arr2` already contains `arr1[0]`, it will now contain this value twice. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` twice, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, and `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` twice, `i` is 1, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, and `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it.**
