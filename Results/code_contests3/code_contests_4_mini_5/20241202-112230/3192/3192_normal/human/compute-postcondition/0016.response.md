The value of `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. Since the state mentions that `maxval` is initially 0, the new value of `maxval` will depend on the value of `arr[i]`. The value of `arr[i]` is unspecified, but it is an element of `arr`, which is derived from `temp` and influenced by `arr1`. 

Assuming `arr` has at least one element, if `arr[i]` is greater than `maxval` (which is 0), `maxval` will be updated to that value. If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to `maxval`, it remains unchanged. The exact new value of `maxval` cannot be specified without knowing `arr[i]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the current situation without changing any other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
