Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0; `arr` contains `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers populated by input values; `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
