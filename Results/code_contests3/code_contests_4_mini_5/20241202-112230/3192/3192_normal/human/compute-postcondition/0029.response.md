The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The value of `arr[i]` is determined by the contents of `arr`, and since `i` is 1, it refers to the second element in `arr`. The value of `maxval` is compared to the maximum of either `arr[i]` or its own current value. The initial values of `arr` and `maxval` are not specified beyond the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0, but since `arr` now contains `temp` appended to it, we can infer that `maxval` will be updated if `arr[i]` is greater than the current `maxval`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value, where `arr[1]` is an element of `arr` and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value, where `arr[1]` is an element of `arr` and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and 0.**
