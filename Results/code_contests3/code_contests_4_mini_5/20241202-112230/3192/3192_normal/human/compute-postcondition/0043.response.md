To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can analyze how the state changes with each iteration.

1. The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an input integer.
2. During each iteration, a list `arr1` is constructed from user input, where `arr1[0]` indicates the number of subsequent integers in the list.
3. The variable `temp` is computed as the maximum value among the integers from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`. If `arr1[0]` is 1, `temp` will be 0.
4. The value of `temp` is appended to the list `arr`.
5. The value of `arr1[0]` is appended to the list `arr2`.
6. The value of `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of the current `maxval` and `arr[i]`.

After all iterations of the loop:

- `arr` will contain the maximum values found in each `arr1` (one for each of the `n` iterations).
- `arr2` will contain the first elements of each `arr1`, which indicates the number of integers that were input for each iteration.
- `maxval` will be the maximum value found in `arr` across all iterations.

Thus, if the loop executed `n` times with `n` being greater than 0, the output state after the loop completes will be:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each iteration's input, `arr2` contains the first elements of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements of `arr`.**
