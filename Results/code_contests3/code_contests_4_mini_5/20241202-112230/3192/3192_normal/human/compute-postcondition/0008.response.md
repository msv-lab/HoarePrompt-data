The `temp` variable is being assigned the maximum value between its current value (which is 0) and the value at `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we need to consider the value of `arr1[1]`. However, we do not have the specific value of `arr1[1]`, only that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, which does not provide information about `arr1[1]`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `temp` is updated to be the maximum between 0 and `arr1[1]`, which could be any integer value depending on `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is max(temp, arr1[1]), `j` is 1**
