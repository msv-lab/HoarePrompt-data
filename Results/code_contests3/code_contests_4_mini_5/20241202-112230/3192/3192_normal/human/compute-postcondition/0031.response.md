The code snippet `arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr1`. The previous variables `maxval`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable created and the unchanged states of the other variables. 

Output State: **`maxval` is updated based on the maximum of `arr[1]` and its previous value; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
