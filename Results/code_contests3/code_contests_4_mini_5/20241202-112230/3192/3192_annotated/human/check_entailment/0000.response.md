Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Maximum Salary Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum salary for each company, but it does not ensure that all companies can be merged based on the condition that merging is only allowed if the maximum salaries are equal. The program assumes that the maximum salary of the merged company will be equal to the overall maximum salary, which may not necessarily be the case after the individual increases.

2. **Salary Increases**: The problem description states that the owners can only increase salaries and that all employees in one company must receive the same increase. However, the logic used to calculate the total increase does not guarantee that the maximum salaries of all companies will be made equal. The program computes the difference between the overall maximum salary and the maximum salary of each company and multiplies it by the number of employees in that company. This calculation does not ensure that the companies can be merged under the given conditions, as it does not account for the possibility that different increases may be necessary for different companies to achieve equal maximum salaries.

3. **Example Validation**: The provided example in the problem description demonstrates a specific sequence of salary increases that results in a total increase of 13. However, the program's logic may not necessarily yield this result for all cases, nor does it follow the correct merging strategy as outlined in the problem description.

In summary, the program fails to ensure that the final result meets the merging condition of equal maximum salaries across all companies, hence it does not meet the problem requirements.
