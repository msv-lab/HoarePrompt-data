The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value at index `j` of the list `arr1`. Since `j` is 2, the code evaluates `arr1[2]`. 

If `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, the new value of `temp` will depend on the comparison between its current value and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `temp` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is either the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
