According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`, meaning `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variables `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` do not directly affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr1` must have a value such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and at the start of the loop, `j` should be initialized to 1. 

State: **`temp` is 0, `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 and `j` is 1**
