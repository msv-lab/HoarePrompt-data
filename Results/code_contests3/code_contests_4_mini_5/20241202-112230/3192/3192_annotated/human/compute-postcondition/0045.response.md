According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once because the range of `i` in `for i in range(n)` will generate values from 0 to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, the value of `i` is already set to `n - 1`, which means that on the first iteration of the loop, `i` will be 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to `i` for the loop to execute.

The other variables (`arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, `temp`, `j`, and `ans`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself but may be relevant for the loop body when it executes. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
