The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 3. Since `j` is 3, we are looking at `arr1[3]`. The maximum value of `temp` will be compared with `arr1[3]`, but the previous value of `temp` is unknown. The other variables (`arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`) remain unchanged. Hence, the output state will reflect this update.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`, `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
