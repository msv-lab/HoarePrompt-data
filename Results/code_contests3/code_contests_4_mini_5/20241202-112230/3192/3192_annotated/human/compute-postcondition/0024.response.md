According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr1`, specifically `arr1[0]`. The loop is set to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, which means the loop can execute one more time.

For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a fourth time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is either the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3**
