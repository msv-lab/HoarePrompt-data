The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value at `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 2, the new value of `temp` will be determined by comparing its previous value (which can either be `arr1[1]` or 0) with the value at `arr1[2]`. The initial state indicates `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must also be greater than 2, implying that `arr1` has at least three elements. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp` based on the comparison.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
