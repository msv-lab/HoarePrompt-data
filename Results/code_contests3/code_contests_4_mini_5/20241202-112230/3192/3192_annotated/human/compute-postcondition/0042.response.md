Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1; otherwise, `temp` is 0; `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is unchanged; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]; `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`.**
