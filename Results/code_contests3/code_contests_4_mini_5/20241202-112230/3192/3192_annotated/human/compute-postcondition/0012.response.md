In the provided code snippet, `temp` is assigned the value of the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[j]`. The variable `j` is 3, so `arr1[j]` refers to the fourth element of the list `arr1`. Since `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, we can deduce some information about `temp`.

However, we do not have the exact values of `temp`, `arr1`, or `arr1[3]` in the initial state. The specific calculation would depend on the values within `arr1`. Therefore, after executing the provided line, we can conclude:

- `temp` is now the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.

Thus, the output state can be articulated as follows, considering the variables that remain unchanged:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is now the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.**
