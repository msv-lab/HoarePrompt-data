According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3**
