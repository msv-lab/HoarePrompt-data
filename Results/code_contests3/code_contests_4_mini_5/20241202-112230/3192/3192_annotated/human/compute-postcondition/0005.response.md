The variable `arr1` is assigned the value obtained from `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which converts the input from `raw_input()` into a list of integers. The initial state indicates that `arr` is an empty list, but `arr1` is being defined here, so it will hold the values provided as input. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `arr1` is a list of integers from input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
