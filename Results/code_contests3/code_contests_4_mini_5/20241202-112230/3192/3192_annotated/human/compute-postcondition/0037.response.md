According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

Since `j` increments by 1 at the beginning of the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 (because `j` will become 3). 

So, adjusting the states accordingly:

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`, `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
