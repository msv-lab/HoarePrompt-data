The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The value of `arr1[0]` is known to be at least 1, as `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `arr2` will contain at least one element, which is the value of `arr1[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]**
