Given the initial state where `temp` is 0, `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1, we analyze the code.

The code `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` will compare the value of `temp` (which is 0) with `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` is the second element of `arr1`. The result of `max(temp, arr1[j])` will be either `temp` (0) or `arr1[1]`. 

If `arr1[1]` is a value greater than 0, `temp` will be updated to that value. However, we do not know the specific value of `arr1[1]`, only that it directly affects `temp`.

Thus, after executing the code, `temp` could either remain 0 (if `arr1[1]` is 0 or less) or change to the value of `arr1[1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, `j` is 1**
