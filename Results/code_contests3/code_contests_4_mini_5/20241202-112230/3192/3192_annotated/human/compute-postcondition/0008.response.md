The code assigns the maximum value between `temp` and `arr1[j]` to `temp`. Given that `temp` is initialized to 0 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we can infer that `arr1[j]` (where `j` is 1) will be an integer from `arr1`. Since `arr1` has at least one element and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr1[1]` must also be a valid integer. 

Thus, the output state will depend on the value of `arr1[1]`. If `arr1[1]` is greater than 0, then `temp` will be assigned that value; if it is less than or equal to 0, `temp` remains 0. 

However, without the specific value of `arr1[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`. Therefore, we will state the possible outcomes based on the available information.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or 0, `j` is 1**.
