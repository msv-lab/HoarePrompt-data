The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in its definition. Instead, it operates based on the constraints provided: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, `m_i` is a positive integer representing the number of employees in each company, and each employee's salary is a positive integer. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the internal constraints of positive integers representing the number of companies and employees, but the specific return value is not defined.**
