`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial conditions state that `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) after accepting input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) after accepting input**
