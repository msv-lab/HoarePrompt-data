According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
