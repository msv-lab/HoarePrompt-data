The `arr2` list is updated by appending the first element of `arr1`, which is `arr1[0]`. This does not affect the values of `temp` or `arr`, but it adds a new element to `arr2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, and if `arr1[0]` is 1, `temp` is 0; `arr` now includes `temp`; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, and if `arr1[0]` is 1, `temp` is 0; `arr` now includes `temp`; `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`**
