The expression modifies the variable `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The values of `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` are not specified, but `i` is currently 2. This means we will use the values of `arr[2]` and `arr2[2]`. The value of `n` being a positive integer greater than 2 allows for the loop to execute again, but does not affect the current calculation. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` is 2
- `arr[i]` is `arr[2]`
- `arr2[i]` is `arr2[2]`
- `maxval` is known but unspecified

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation without giving specific numeric values for `arr[2]`, `arr2[2]`, or `maxval`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2; `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2].**
