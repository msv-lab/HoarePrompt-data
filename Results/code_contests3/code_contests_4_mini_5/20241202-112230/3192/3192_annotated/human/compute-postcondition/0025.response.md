`temp` is assigned the value of the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is 3, so we are comparing `temp` with `arr1[3]`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is either the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, but we do not have specific values for `temp` or `arr1`. Therefore, the output state reflects that we calculate the maximum based on the current values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.**
