The loop iterates from 1 through `arr1[0] - 1`, checking each value in `arr1` to find the maximum value among those at indices 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times. At the end of the loop:

- `temp` will contain the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.
- `j` will equal `arr1[0]` since it will be incremented until it reaches this value.

If `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]`.**
