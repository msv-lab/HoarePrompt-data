According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
