The expression `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` modifies the value of `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not specified, but we know that `i` is currently 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer, we assume that `arr` and `arr2` are lists or arrays that are sufficiently sized to access the element at index `i`. Therefore, the output state will depend on the specific values of `maxval`, `arr[1]`, and `arr2[1]`.

However, since we do not have specific values for `maxval`, `arr`, or `arr2`, we can only state that `ans` is updated based on the current values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1; `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]**
