The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. The initial value of `temp` is already updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, so it takes that value. The other variables remain unchanged as stated. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp` based on `arr1[2]` and the values of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[2]`; `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`; `maxval` remains unchanged; `j` is 2; for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
