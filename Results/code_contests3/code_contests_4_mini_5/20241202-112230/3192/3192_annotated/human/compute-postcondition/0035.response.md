According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit given by `arr1[0]`. The loop iterates starting from `j = 1` up to but not including `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. 

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1`, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
