According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The `xrange` function will iterate from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and does not directly influence the loop execution, it is not necessary to adjust it. 

So, for the loop to execute, `arr1` must be a list with its first element `arr1[0]` being greater than 1, and `j` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
