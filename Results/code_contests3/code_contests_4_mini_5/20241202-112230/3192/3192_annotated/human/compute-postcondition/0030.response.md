According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its previous value, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will be `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute another time, `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

Since `maxval` is updated based on the values in `arr`, and `temp` is included in `arr`, it is implied that these variables are also part of the program state. However, for the loop to continue, only `i` and `n` need to be considered.

State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; arr` now includes `temp`; arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
