`temp` is assigned the value 0. Since `temp` was previously the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, and now it is explicitly set to 0, this indicates that the maximum value is being reset. The other variables (`arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `arr1`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is 0; `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1` previously, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is 0; `arr` includes the maximum value from `arr1` previously, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` remains unchanged.**
