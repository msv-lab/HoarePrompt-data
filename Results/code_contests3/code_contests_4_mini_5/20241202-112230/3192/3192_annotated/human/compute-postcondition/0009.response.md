According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr1`. The loop iterates starting from `j = 1` and continues while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be 2, and the loop can still execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
