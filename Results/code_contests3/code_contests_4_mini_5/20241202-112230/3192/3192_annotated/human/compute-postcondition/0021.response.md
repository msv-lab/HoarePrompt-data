`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 and `j` is 1, the value of `arr1[j]` is determined by the specific element at index 1 in the list `arr1`. The value of `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
