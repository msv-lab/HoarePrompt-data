According to the code, the loop executes based on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1, which means that for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
