According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. Since `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the loop variable `j` starts at 1, which means it will be initialized to 1 at the beginning of the first iteration. 

Given that `arr` and `arr2` are empty lists, they do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `arr1` having at least one element and `arr1[0]` being greater than 1. Initially, `j` will be set to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is initialized to 0, `j` is 1**
