To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the line `maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)`.

1. **Impact of the Code**: 
   - The variable `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `maxval` and the element at index `i` in the list `arr`.
   - The values of `arr`, `i`, and `maxval` are crucial for calculating the new value of `maxval`.

2. **Previous Values**:
   - `arr` contains `temp`.
   - `maxval` is initially 0.
   - `i` is 0, which means we are accessing the first element of `arr`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Since `arr` contains `temp`, and we are accessing `arr[0]`, the new value of `maxval` will be `max(arr[0], 0)`.
   - If `arr[0]` is greater than 0, `maxval` will be updated to `arr[0]`. If `arr[0]` is 0, `maxval` will remain 0. 

Thus, the output state depends on the value of `arr[0]` (which is equal to `temp`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains `temp`, `maxval` is either `temp` or 0 based on `arr[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]`.**
