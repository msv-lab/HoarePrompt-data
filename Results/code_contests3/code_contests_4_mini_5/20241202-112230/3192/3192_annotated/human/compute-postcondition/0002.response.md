`maxval` is assigned the value 0, and there are no previous values for `arr` since it is an empty list. The value of `n` does not affect `maxval` or `arr` in this case. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
