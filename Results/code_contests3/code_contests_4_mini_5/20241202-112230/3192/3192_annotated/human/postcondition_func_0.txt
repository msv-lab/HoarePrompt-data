The function reads a positive integer `n`, representing the number of companies, and then for each company, it reads a list of integers where the first integer indicates the number of employees, followed by the salaries of those employees. It calculates the maximum salary among all employees across the companies and then computes a total `ans`, which is the sum of the differences between the maximum salary and the maximum salary in each company multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it prints this total. The function does not return any value but prints the result instead.
