The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, and during each iteration, it updates `temp` to be the maximum value between the current `temp` and the element at index `j` of `arr1`. After all iterations of the loop are completed, `temp` will hold the maximum value of all the elements from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times, and `temp` will be the maximum of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. If `arr1[0]` is equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0]` ≥ 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
