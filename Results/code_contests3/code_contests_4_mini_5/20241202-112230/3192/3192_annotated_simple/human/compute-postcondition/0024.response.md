According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop starts with `j` being 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `j`. Since at the end of the last iteration `j` is 2, we need `arr1[0]` to be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. After the current iteration, `j` will increase by 1 to 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, and `j` will be updated to 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least one integer greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
