According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

So, if the loop executes again, `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
