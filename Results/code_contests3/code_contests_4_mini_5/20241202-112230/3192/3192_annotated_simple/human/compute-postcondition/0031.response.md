The code assigns a new value to `arr1` by taking input from the user and converting it to a list of integers. The previous state indicates that `arr1` contained at least `arr1[0]` integers greater than 1, but after the execution of this line, `arr1` will now contain a new set of integers based on user input. Other variables like `n`, `i`, `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `j` remain unaffected in terms of their values; however, `arr1` will change entirely based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a new list of integers based on user input, `temp` is the maximum value from the new `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` contains `temp` twice, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, and `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1.`**
