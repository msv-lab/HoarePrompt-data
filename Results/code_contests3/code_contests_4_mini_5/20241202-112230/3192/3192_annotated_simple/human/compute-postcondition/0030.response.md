According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list containing at least `arr1[0]` integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` contains `temp` twice, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, and `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, and `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1.`**
