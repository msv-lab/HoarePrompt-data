Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least one integer greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
