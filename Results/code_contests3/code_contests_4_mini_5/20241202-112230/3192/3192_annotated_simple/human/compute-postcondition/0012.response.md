The code assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 3, the value of `arr1[j]` refers to the fourth element in the list `arr1`. 

Since `temp` is updated to `max(temp, arr1[3])`, the output state will reflect the new value of `temp`. The previous value of `temp` is not specified but is less than or equal to `arr1[3]` since `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time. The values of `n`, `i`, and `arr1` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[3]), `j` is 3.**
