According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 since `xrange` starts from 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `temp` is initialized to 0, we need to ensure that `arr1` has at least one element and that this element satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and the variable `j` should start at 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0]` > 1, `temp` is initialized to 0, `j` is 1**
