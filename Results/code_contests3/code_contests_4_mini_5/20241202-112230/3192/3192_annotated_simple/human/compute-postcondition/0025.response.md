Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `arr1` is a list containing at least one integer greater than 1
- `temp` is the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`
- `arr` now contains `temp`
- `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it
- `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`
- `j` is 3 for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3

The code snippet provided is:
```
temp = max(temp, arr1[j])
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. The variable `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`.
2. The previous value of `temp` is not specified, but it is already defined as the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`.
3. The value of `arr1[j]` is being used, where `j` is 3, which means we are accessing the fourth element of the list `arr1`.
4. The new value of `temp` will depend on the values of `temp` and `arr1[3]`.

Hence, the output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`, but without specific values for `temp` or `arr1[3]`, we describe it generally:

Output State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and `arr1[3]`.**
