The value of `temp` is explicitly set to 0, which means that the previous value of `temp` is replaced. The values of other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a new list of integers, `temp` is 0, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`.
