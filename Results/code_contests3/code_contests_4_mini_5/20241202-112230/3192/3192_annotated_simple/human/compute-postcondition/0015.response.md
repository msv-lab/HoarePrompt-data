Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0]` ≥ 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`, and `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it.**
