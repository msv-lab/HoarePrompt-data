According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. After the current iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 3.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
