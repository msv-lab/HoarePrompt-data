The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 3. The code checks `arr1[3]`, but since the exact values of `temp` and `arr1[3]` are not provided, we cannot determine the new value of `temp`. The other variables and states are not affected, and the loop will execute one more time only if `arr1[0]` is greater than 3. Therefore, the output state includes the current state of `temp`, the value of `arr1[3]` being evaluated, and the condition for the loop to execute.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 3; for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
