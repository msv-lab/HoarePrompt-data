The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` was updated to `max(0, arr1[1])`, so `temp` is at least `arr1[1]` (since `arr1[1]` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 0). The variable `j` is 2, so `arr1[j]` corresponds to `arr1[2]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `temp` will be the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`, but we do not have the specific values of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`, so we can only state that `temp` is updated based on these values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 2**
