The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The value of `temp` is defined based on the contents of `arr1`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` starting from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. If `arr1[0]` is 1, `temp` is 0. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0]` ≥ 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] if `arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`.**
