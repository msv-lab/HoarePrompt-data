The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer), `i` (which is 0 for the first execution), `arr` (an array where the value at index 0 is `arr[0]`), and `arr2` (an array where the value at index 0 is `arr2[0]`). Therefore, after execution, `ans` is updated based on these values. The states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]**
