According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The `for` loop will iterate from `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`, which means `arr1[0]` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer greater than `1`, `i` is `1`, `temp` is `0`, `arr` contains `temp`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, and `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`. However, the state of `arr1` needs to be such that `arr1[0]` is greater than `1` for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- `arr1` is a list containing at least one element that is greater than `1`.
- `j` will start at `1` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least one integer greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval, j is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
