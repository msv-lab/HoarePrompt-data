The value of `arr1` is updated by taking input from the user and converting it into a list of integers. This changes the state of `arr1` to the new list of integers provided as input. The previous values of `temp`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` are not affected directly by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a new list of integers, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] if arr1[0] > 1, otherwise temp is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`.**
