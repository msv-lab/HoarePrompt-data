The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. The value of `arr1[j]` is determined by the list `arr1`, where `j` is 1. Since `arr1[0] > 1`, it can be inferred that `arr1` contains positive integers. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the value of `arr1[1]` if it is greater than 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `temp` has been updated based on the value at `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0]` > 1, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[1]), `j` is 1**
