The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, which means it will take an input that is converted to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, but the actual value will depend on the input provided. The other variables related to companies and salaries are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)**
