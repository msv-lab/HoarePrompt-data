According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop executes while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since it is a positive integer). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is updated to max(temp, arr1[2]), `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
