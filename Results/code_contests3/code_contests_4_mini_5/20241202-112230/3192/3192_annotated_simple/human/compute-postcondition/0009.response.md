According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1` (which is `arr1[0]`). The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1` has at least one element where `arr1[0] > 1`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least one element where `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[1]), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
