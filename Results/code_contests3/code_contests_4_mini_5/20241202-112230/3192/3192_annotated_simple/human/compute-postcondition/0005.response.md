The code assigns a list of integers to `arr1` by reading input from the user, splitting it by spaces, and converting each part into an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0, which implies that the loop is set to execute. However, since the code does not alter the values of `n` or `i`, we only observe the new variable `arr1`. The exact values in `arr1` will depend on the user's input, which is not specified. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from user input**
