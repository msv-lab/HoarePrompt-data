To analyze the final output state after the loop has executed completely, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`. Therefore, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times.
2. The variable `temp` will hold the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`.
3. If `arr1` has at least `arr1[0]` elements, the final value of `temp` will be the maximum value of the elements `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.
4. The other variables like `n`, `i`, `arr`, and `arr2` will retain their previously assigned values.

Given these observations, the output state can be framed as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least `arr1[0]` integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, and `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1` after the loop terminates.**
