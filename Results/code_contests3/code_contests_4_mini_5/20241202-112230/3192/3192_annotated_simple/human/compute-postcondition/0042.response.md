The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. The value of `maxval` is dependent on the current iteration of the loop, but its previous value is not provided in the initial state. The variable `arr[i]` is also not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only conclude that `maxval` is updated based on the maximum of two values.

Output State: **`maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.**
