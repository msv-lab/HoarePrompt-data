According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop is set to execute while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least one integer greater than 1, `temp` is `arr1[1]`, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
