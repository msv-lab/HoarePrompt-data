According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop executes as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. After the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**
