The code `arr.append(temp)` appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The previous state indicates that `arr` already contains `temp`. Therefore, after execution, `arr` will contain `temp` twice. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least `arr1[0]` integers greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `arr` now contains `temp` twice, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, and `j` is equal to `arr1[0] - 1 after the loop terminates.**
