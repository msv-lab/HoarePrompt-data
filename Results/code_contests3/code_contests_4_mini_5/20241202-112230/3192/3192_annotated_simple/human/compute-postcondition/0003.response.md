The variable `arr2` is assigned an empty list. The other variables `n`, `arr`, and `maxval` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.**
