According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, which is the last value it can take in the range generated by `xrange(n)`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be initialized to 0. The state before the loop starts is already sufficient for its execution, as `arr` and `arr2` being empty does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
