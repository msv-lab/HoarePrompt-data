The code assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is initially 0, and since `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of `arr1`. The conditions state that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, but the value of `arr1[1]` is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp` after the operation since we need the value of `arr1[1]`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `temp` is updated based on the comparison, but the actual result depends on the unspecified value of `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[1]`**
