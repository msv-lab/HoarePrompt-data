The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables, `n` and `arr`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `maxval` is set to `0`, while `n` is still a positive integer, and `arr` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
