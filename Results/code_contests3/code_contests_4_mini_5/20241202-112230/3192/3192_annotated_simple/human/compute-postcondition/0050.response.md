The value of `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]` are required to compute the exact change in `ans`, but they are not provided. The values of `n` and `i` do not affect this specific operation directly, but `i` is 2, indicating that it refers to the third element of the lists `arr` and `arr2`. Therefore, the output state indicates that the operation has taken place but does not specify the exact values since they are unknown.

Output State: **`ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]**
