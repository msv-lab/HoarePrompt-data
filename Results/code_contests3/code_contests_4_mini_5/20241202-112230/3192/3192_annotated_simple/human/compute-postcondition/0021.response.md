The code assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is 0, and `arr1` contains integers greater than 1. Since `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of `arr1`. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`. 

Assuming `arr1[1]` is greater than 1 (as stated in the initial state), `temp` will be assigned the value of `arr1[1]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list containing at least one integer greater than 1, `temp` is `arr1[1]`, `arr` now contains `temp`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
