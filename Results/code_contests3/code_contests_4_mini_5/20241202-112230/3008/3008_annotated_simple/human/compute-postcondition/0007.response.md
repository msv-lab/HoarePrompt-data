Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a non-negative integer `n` from user input. If the last digit of `n` is not 0, it sets a variable `s` to 1; otherwise, `s` remains 0. The function then prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, the input `n` is treated as a string, which may lead to a TypeError when attempting to perform arithmetic operations. Therefore, the functionality is to read an input value and print a calculation based on that value, but it may fail due to input type issues. **
