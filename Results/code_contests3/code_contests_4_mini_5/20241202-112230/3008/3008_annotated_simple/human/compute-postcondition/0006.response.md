The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \). The specific output or behavior of the function based on the value of `n` has not been provided. Therefore, without additional information on how the function utilizes `n` or what it returns, we cannot detail the functionality further.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraint that n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The specific output or return value is not defined based on the provided information.**
