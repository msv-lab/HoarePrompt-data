The variable `s` is assigned the value `1`. The initial value of `s` was `0`, but it is now updated to `1`. The values of `n` remain unchanged, as the assignment of `s` does not affect `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string, `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input string, `s` is 1**
