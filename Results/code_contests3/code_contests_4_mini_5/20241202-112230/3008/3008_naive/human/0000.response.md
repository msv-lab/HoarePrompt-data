Correctness: **False**.

The program provided attempts to compute the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the magic number `n` to zero by subtracting its digits. However, it does not correctly handle several cases. 

For instance, consider the input `n = 24`:

1. The calculation `n / 10` gives `2.4`, and `2 * (n / 10)` results in `4.8`, which is then rounded to `4` when converted to an integer output. 
2. The program adds `1` if `n % 10` is not `0`, which adds an incorrect additional operation.

The correct sequence of operations for `n = 24` should yield `5` (as shown in the example), but the program does not account for the method of subtraction correctly, ultimately leading to incorrect results for many inputs, particularly for those with various combinations of digits. 

Another example is when `n = 0`, where the output should be `0`, but the program does not handle this case explicitly and would produce `0` incorrectly without needing any operation.

Thus, the logic used to compute the minimum number of operations is flawed and does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
