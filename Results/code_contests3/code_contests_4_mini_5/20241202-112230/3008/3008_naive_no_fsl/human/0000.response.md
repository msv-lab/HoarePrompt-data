Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. 

1. The input `n` is read as a string, but it should be converted to an integer for further calculations. This will lead to incorrect behavior when performing arithmetic operations.
2. The logic to calculate the minimum number of operations is flawed:
   - The line `if n % 10 != 0: s = 1` only checks if the last digit is not zero and sets `s` to `1` if that is true. This does not account for how many digits need to be subtracted.
   - The expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` does not correctly compute the number of operations required to reduce `n` to zero, as it assumes a fixed pattern of operations that does not reflect the necessary steps based on the digits present in `n`.

For example, if we consider the input `n = 24`, the program will output `5`, which is correct in this specific case. However, for an input like `n = 10`, the expected minimum number of operations to reduce to zero would be `2` (10 â†’ 0), but the program will incorrectly compute it as `2 * (10 / 10) + 1 = 3`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle all potential cases, leading to an incorrect implementation overall.
