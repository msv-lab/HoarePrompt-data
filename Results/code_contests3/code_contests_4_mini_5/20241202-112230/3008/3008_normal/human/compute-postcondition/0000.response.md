The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input as a string. Since the initial state defines `n` as a non-negative integer, after execution, `n` will now hold the string representation of the input value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now a string input representing a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is now a string input representing a non-negative integer**
