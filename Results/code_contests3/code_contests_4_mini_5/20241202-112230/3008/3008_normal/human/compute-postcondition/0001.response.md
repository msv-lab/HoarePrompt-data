`s` is assigned the value `0`, which initializes it to zero. Since `n` is a string input representing a non-negative integer, it remains unchanged by this assignment. Thus, the output reflects the updated value of `s`, while `n` stays as is. 

Output State: **`n` is a string input representing a non-negative integer, `s` is 0**
