Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a non-negative integer from user input as a string. It checks if the last digit of the integer is not zero and sets a variable `s` to 1 if true, otherwise `s` remains 0. Then, it attempts to print the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. However, since `n` is a string, attempting to perform division will raise a TypeError, and the output is not defined due to this error. Thus, the function does not handle the conversion of `n` from a string to an integer, leading to a potential runtime error.**
