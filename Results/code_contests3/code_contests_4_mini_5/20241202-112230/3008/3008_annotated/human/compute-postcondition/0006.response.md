The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer where \(0 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). However, since there are no parameters to input into the function, we cannot derive specific output conditions based on input values. Thus, the functionality of the function is not tied to any input parameters, and the output is not specified. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not specify any return values based on input.**
