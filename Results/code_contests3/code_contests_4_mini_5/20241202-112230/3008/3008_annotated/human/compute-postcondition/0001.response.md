The variable `s` is assigned the value of 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as the initial state specifies that `n` is assigned an input value. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is assigned a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is assigned a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `s` is 0**
