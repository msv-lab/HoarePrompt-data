The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It sorts this list in descending order and calculates the sum of the largest integer and the next `k` largest integers, ensuring that `k` does not exceed `n - 1`. The function then prints the resulting sum for each test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` to be `n - 1`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly.
