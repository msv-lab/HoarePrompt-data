The list `arr` is sorted in descending order (reverse=True). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the order of the elements in `arr` is now from highest to lowest. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `arr` has been modified while all other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
