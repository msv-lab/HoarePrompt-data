The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is provided from input, but its specific value is unknown. Therefore, `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` holds. Other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `n` is from input, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is `arr[0]`**.
