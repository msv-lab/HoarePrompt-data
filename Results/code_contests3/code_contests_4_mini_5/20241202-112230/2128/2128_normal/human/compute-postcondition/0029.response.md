The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 3, `arr[l]` refers to `arr[3]`. Since the value of `arr[3]` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. However, other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[3]`, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[3]`, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
