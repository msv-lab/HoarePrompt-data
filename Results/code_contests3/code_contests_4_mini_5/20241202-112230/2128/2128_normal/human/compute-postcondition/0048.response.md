The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature, but it operates based on predefined inputs that adhere to specific constraints for each test case. 

For each test case:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element \(a_i\) is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
- The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function returns values based on the processing of these inputs, which are not explicitly detailed in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, and return results based on the defined criteria applied to these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases with the parameters t, n, k, and a, returning results based on the criteria applied to these inputs.**
