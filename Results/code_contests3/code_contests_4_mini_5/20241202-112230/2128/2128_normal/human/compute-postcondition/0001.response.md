According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = t - 1`. Since `t` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to 0, and `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
