According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `ans` has been increased by `arr[l]`, and `k` is at least 1. Since the loop starts with `l` at 1 and goes up to `k`, `l` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2 so that `l` can be 2 in the next iteration. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, `k` is at least 2 and `l` is 2**
