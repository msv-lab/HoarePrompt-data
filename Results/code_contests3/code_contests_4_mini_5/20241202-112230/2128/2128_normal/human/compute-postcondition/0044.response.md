The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. The value of `l` is 3, so `arr[l]` refers to `arr[3]`. The specific value of `arr[3]` is not provided, but it is used to update `ans`. Therefore, the other variables are not affected by this operation, and we do not know the specific value of `arr[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `l` is 3, `ans` is incremented by `arr[3]`.**
