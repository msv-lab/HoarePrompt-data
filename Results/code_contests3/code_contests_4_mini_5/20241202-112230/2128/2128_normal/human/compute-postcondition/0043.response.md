According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n - 1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2. Given that `l` is currently 2 at the end of the last iteration, the next value of `l` will be 3.

For the loop to execute a third time, `k` must still be at least 3 (since `l` will be incremented to 3). 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3, `l` is 3, `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`.**
