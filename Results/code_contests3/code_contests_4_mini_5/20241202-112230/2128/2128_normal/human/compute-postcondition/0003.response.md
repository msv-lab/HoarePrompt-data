The code reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts those components into integers, which are then stored in a list called `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this operation, but `arr` will now hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The previous values of `n` and `k` are still valid, but we do not know their actual values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
