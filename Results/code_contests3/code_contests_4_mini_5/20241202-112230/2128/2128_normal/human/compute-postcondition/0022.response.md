The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The variable `n` is derived from input, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, `k` will be one less than whatever value `n` holds. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is arr[0]; `k` is `n - 1`.**
