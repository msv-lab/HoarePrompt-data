`ans` is assigned the value of the first element in the sorted array `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `ans` based on the existing state of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is arr[0]**
