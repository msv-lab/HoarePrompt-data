The variable `k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. Since `k` is initially greater than or equal to `n`, the new value of `k` will be less than or equal to `n - 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is the largest integer from `arr`; `k` is updated to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is the largest integer from `arr`; `k` is updated to `n - 1.**
