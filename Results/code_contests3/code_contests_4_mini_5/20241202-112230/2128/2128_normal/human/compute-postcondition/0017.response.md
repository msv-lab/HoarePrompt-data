According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `t`, which must still hold true after the increment. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
