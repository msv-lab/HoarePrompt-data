The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value `arr[l]` to it. The value of `l` is 3, so `arr[l]` refers to the fourth element of the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `arr[3]` would be the fourth largest integer in the list. The previous state of `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[3]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[3]`, `l` is 3**
