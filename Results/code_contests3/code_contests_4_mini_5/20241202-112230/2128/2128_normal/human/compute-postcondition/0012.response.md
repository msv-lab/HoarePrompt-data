`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The value of `l` is 2, so `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`. The value of `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, but the exact value at index 2 is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 2**
