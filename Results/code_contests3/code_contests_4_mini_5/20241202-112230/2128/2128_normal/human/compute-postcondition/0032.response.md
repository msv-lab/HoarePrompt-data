According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` must be less than `t` for the loop to continue. 

After the current iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 2**
