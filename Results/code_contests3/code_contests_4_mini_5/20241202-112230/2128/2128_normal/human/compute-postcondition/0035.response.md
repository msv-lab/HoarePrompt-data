`arr` is assigned the sorted values of itself in descending order (reverse=True). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the specific contents of `arr` will be rearranged. The output state will reflect the fact that `arr` is now sorted in reverse order. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
