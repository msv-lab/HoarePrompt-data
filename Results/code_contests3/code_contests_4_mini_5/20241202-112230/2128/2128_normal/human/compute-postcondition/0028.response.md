According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the upper limit defined by `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1.

Since `l` is currently 2, it will become 3 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be at least 3. 

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3**
