The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged; only `arr` is affected. The previous state of `arr` is not specified, but it will now be sorted in reverse. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are integers; `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
