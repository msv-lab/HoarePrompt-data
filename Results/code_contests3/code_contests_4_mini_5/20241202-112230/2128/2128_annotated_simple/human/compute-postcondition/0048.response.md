The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three components: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` non-negative integers. Here are the specifics of each parameter:

1. `n`: This is an integer that represents the number of barrels, and it must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\).
2. `k`: This is an integer that represents a specific quantity related to the barrels, satisfying the constraint \(1 \leq k < n\).
3. A list of integers: This list contains `n` non-negative integers, each representing the amount of water in the corresponding barrel. The individual values in the list must satisfy \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

After executing the function, it processes the input parameters according to the logic defined in the function body and returns output based on the conditions set for the test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` non-negative integers representing the amounts of water in the barrels. It processes these inputs and returns results based on those parameters.**
