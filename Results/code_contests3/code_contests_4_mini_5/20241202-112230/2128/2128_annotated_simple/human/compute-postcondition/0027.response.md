The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since the initial value of `ans` is increased by the value at index 2 of the array `arr`, the state of `ans` changes accordingly. However, the specific values in `arr` and `ans` are not provided, so we can only indicate that `ans` has been modified.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**
