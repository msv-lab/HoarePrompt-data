The variable `arr` is assigned the sorted version of itself in descending order, as indicated by `reverse=True`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `arr`, which is now sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input; `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
