`ans` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr`, which is `arr[0]`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is the first element of `arr`.**
