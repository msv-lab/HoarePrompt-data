According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
