`k` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The value of `n` is taken from input, and since `n` can be any integer, `k` will be one less than that value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr**.
