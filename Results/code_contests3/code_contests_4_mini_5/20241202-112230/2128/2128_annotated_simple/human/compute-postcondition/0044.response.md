`ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 4, `ans` will now include the value of `arr[4]`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `i`, and `k`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include `arr[4]`, `l` is 4, and `k` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include `arr[4]`, `l` is 4, and `k` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time.**
