According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute if `k + 1` is greater than `1`, which means that `k` must be at least `1`. Given that `k` is defined as `n - 1`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least `2` (since `k` must be at least `1`).

Additionally, the loop initializes `l` at `1` and will iterate up to and including `k`. Therefore, if `k` is `1`, the loop will execute once for `l = 1`. 

Since we have the condition that `t` is greater than `1` and `i` is `1`, we do not need to change these states for the loop to execute. 

Thus, the necessary condition for the loop to execute is: `n` must be at least `2`, and `k` is `n - 1`, which would then make `k` at least `1`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1,` for the loop to execute the first time `l` is 1**.
