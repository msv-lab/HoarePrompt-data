The code `arr = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a list from those integers. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, which are integers, and `arr` will hold the list of integers derived from the input line.

Since `t` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2, they do not directly affect the creation of the list `arr`. The final output state will reflect that `arr` is now populated with integers based on the input line read.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `arr` is a list of integers from the input line.**
