According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop starts with `l` initialized to 1 and will continue as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be increased by 1, which means `l` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the first element of the list `arr` plus `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be at least 3, `l` is 3**.
