The code prints the value of `ans`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `ans` has been updated to the largest element of `arr` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`, where `k` is less than or equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the value of `ans` being printed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is printed.**
