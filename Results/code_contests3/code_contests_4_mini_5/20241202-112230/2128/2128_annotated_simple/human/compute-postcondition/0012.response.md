`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`. The variable `l` is 2, so `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the `arr` array, which is part of the sorted descending order. The previous value of `ans` is the largest element of `arr`. Therefore, after executing the statement, the new value of `ans` becomes the previous value of `ans` plus `arr[2]`. The other variables remain unaffected, but the output will reflect the updated value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to the largest element of `arr` plus `arr[2]`, `l` is 2**.
