The code initializes `arr` with a list of integers derived from the input split by spaces. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The value of `arr` will depend on the input provided, but its exact contents are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr` is now a list of integers, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input; `arr` is a list of integers from the input.**
