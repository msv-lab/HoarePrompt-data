The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is 3, this means that `ans` now becomes `ans + arr[3]`. Other variables (`t`, `i`, and `l`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`, and `l` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`, `l` is 3**
