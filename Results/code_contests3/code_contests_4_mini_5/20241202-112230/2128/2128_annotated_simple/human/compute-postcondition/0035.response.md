`arr` is assigned the value of itself sorted in reverse order. The previous value of `arr` is a list of integers from the input line, and since `t` is greater than 1, we can assume that `arr` contains multiple elements. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.**
