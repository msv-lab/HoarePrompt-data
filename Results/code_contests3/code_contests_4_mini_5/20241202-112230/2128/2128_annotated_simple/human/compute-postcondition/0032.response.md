According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit `t`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. 

Since `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute again when `i` is 2. 

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be at least 2**.
