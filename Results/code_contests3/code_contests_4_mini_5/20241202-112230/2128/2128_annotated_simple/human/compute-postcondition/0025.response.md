The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 1, `arr[l]` refers to the second element of the array `arr`. Since `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, and `k` is equal to `n - 1`, the execution of this line affects only the variable `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `n - 1,` `l` is 1, and `ans` is increased by `arr[1]`.**
