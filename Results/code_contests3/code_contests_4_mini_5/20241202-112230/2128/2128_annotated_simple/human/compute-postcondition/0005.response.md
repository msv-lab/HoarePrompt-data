`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in the array. The previous values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not altered by this operation, so they remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `ans` while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.**
