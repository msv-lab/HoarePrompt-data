According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` and `k`. The loop will execute for `l` starting from 1 up to and including `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 (since it starts from 1) and for the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `l` will increase by 1 after each iteration, for the loop to execute a second time, `l` must be 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`, `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `l` is 2**
