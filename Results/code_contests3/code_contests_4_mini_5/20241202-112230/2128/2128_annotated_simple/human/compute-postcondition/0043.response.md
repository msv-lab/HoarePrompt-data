According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `l` and the value of `k`. The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `l` would be 4. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 4, as it needs to be greater than or equal to `l`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`, `l` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 4**
