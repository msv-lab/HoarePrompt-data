According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2 and since `k` is at least 2, it implies that the loop has executed for `l` equal to 1 and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be increased by 1, resulting in `l` being 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3, as `l` must be less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**
