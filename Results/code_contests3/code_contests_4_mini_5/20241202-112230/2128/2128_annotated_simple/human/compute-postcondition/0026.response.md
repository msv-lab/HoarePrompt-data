According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, inclusive. Given that at the end of the last iteration `l` is 1 and `k` is equal to `n - 1`, with `n` being at least 2, `k` must be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute again, `l` needs to be incremented. Since `l` is currently 1, after the next iteration, `l` will be 2. The loop will execute again as long as `l` (which will be 2) is less than or equal to `k` (which is `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2, and `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**.
