The function will receive multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), an integer k (1 ≤ k < n), and a list of n non-negative integers representing the amounts of water in the barrels (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of barrels across all test cases will not exceed 200,000.
