The function reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers. The function sorts the list in descending order and calculates the sum of the largest element and the next `k` largest elements, ensuring that `k` does not exceed `n-1`. The computed sum is then printed for each test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it is adjusted to `n-1`. The function does not return any values but outputs the results directly.
