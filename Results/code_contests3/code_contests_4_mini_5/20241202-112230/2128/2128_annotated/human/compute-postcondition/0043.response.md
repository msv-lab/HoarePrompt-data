According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1, making `l` equal to 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 3, `l` is 3.**
