According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `l` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `l` will become 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 2, `l` is 2; `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[1]`.**
