`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array in descending order. Since `arr` is sorted, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in the array. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`.**
