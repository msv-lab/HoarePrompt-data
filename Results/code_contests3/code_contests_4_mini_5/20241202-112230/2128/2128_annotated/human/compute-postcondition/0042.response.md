The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`. Given that `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the `arr` list. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, we can expect `arr[l]` to be a specific integer value. The previous value of `ans` was defined as the sum of the first element of `arr` and `arr[l]`. Thus, after executing the line of code, the new value of `ans` will be equal to its previous value plus `arr[l]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 2.**
