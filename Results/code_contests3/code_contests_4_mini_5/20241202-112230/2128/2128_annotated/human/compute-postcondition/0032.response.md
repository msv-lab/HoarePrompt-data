According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
