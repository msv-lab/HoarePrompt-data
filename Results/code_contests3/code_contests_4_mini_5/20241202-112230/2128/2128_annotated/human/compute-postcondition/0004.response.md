The list `arr` is assigned the value of its sorted version in descending order (reverse=True). The previous state of `arr` is a list of integers, but the specific values are not given. Therefore, after sorting, `arr` will contain the same integers but arranged in decreasing order. The states of the other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is the list of integers sorted in descending order.**
