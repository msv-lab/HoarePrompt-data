The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[l]` is an element in the array, and since `l` is not specified, we assume it is a valid index within the bounds of `arr`. The value of `ans` will increase, but the exact value of `arr[l]` and the previous value of `ans` are not specified. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]**
