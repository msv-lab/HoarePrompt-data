`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted list `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will be the largest integer in the list. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is the list of integers sorted in descending order, and `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is the list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`**.
