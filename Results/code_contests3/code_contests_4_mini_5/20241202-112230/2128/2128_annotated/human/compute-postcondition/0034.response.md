The code assigns a new list to the variable `arr` by reading a line from standard input, splitting it by spaces, and converting each element to an integer using `map`. The values of `n` and `k` are originally assigned from the input, but the contents of the input line are now used to create the list `arr`. Other variables (`t` and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2; `arr` is a list of integers from input**
