According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `l` and the upper limit defined by `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `l` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3, and `l` will then be incremented to 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 3, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be at least 3.**
