According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and since `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute again for `l` being 2. 

After this iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1, so `l` will be 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the first element of `arr` plus `arr[l]`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2, `l` is 2**
