`arr` is assigned the value of a sorted version of itself in reverse order. The original values of `arr` are not specified, but since it is a list of integers from input, the sorted list will contain the same integers rearranged in descending order. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.**
