The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. Instead, it operates based on certain constraints related to the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

The function produces an output based on the conditions specified in the output section (which isn't provided in the prompt). However, we can summarize that:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but operates based on the constraints of t, n, k, and a. It returns output based on certain logic that processes these variables.**
