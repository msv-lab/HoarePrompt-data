According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will become 1, and `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
