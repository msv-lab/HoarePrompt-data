The value of `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is assigned a value from input and is greater than or equal to `k`, it is implied that `n` is at least 1. Therefore, `k` will now be one less than `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input value, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`**.
