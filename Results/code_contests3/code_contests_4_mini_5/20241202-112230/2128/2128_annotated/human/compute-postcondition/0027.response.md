The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order and the specific value of `arr[2]` is assumed to be valid, `ans` will now hold the previous value of `ans` plus `arr[2]`. The variable `k` is required to be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, which implies that the loop could potentially continue depending on its current value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 2, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`.**
