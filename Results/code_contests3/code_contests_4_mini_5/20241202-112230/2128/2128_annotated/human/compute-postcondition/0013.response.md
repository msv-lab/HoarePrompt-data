According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `l` and `k`. If `l` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and since `k` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time. After the current iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1, so `l` will be 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `k` is at least 3, `l` is 3; `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[2]`.**
