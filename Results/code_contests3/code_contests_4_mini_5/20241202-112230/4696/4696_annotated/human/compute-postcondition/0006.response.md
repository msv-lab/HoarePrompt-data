`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `n` is at least 1 and `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time, the expression `n - k` will be at least 0. Therefore, `f` will hold the value of the factorial of a non-negative integer (specifically `factorial(n - 1)` if `k` is 1). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
