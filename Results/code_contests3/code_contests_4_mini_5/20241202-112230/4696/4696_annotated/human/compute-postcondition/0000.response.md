In this case, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`. Since `raw_input()` accepts input from the user and `split()` divides the input into separate components, `a` and `b` will hold these individual components as strings. The previous values of `n` and `m` are unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings from raw_input.**
