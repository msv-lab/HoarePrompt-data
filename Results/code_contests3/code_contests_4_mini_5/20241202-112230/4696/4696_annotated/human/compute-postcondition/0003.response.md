The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was assigned the integer value of the input string `b`. Since there are no other variables affected, the output state reflects the updated value of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer value of the input string `a`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings from raw_input; `i` is decremented by 1**
