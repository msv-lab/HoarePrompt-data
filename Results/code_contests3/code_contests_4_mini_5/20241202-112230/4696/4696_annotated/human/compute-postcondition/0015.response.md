The code attempts to remove an element from the list `p` using the index `d`. However, since `d` is not defined, this will result in an error. The values of `n`, `k`, `f`, and any other variables remain unchanged as the operation cannot be completed due to the error. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1; `k` is 2; `f` is either not defined or 1 or a positive integer; `d` is not defined; an attempt to print `p[d]` results in an error due to `d` being undefined; and the operation to remove `p[d]` cannot be performed.
