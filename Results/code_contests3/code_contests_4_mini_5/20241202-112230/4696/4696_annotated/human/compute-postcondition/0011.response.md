According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the range defined in the loop. The loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `n` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 2.

The current state indicates that `n` is at least 1, which means `n + 1` is at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
