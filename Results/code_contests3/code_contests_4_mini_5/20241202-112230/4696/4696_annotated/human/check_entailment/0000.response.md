The program described seems to be attempting to calculate the m-th lexicographic permutation of the numbers from 1 to n. However, it lacks proper handling of the maximum value of the function f(p) as specified in the problem description. 

Let's analyze the details:

1. The problem requires finding the m-th permutation of length n that maximizes the value of f(p). However, the function `func()` does not compute or check the value of f(p) at all. It simply computes the m-th permutation in lexicographic order without considering whether that permutation maximizes f(p).

2. The lack of handling for the permutations that yield maximum f(p) is a critical oversight. The program assumes that all permutations generated will yield the same maximum value of f(p), which is not necessarily true without any validation or calculation for f(p).

3. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where m exceeds the number of valid permutations with maximum f(p). This can lead to potential errors or incorrect output.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
