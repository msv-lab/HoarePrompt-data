The function accepts no parameters directly but reads two positive integers from input: `n`, which indicates the length of permutations and must be between 1 and 50, and `i`, which specifies a position among the permutations. It then calculates and prints the `i-th` permutation of the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]` in lexicographic order. The function does not handle cases where `i` exceeds the total number of permutations for the given `n`, which could lead to incorrect behavior or an index error.
