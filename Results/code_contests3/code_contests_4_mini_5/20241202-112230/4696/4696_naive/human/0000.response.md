To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and functionality based on the problem description. 

The problem requires finding the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n that maximizes a certain function f(p). The program is designed to read the integers n and m, calculate the appropriate permutation, and print it.

Upon reviewing the code:

```python
(a, b) = raw_input().split()
n = int(a)
i = int(b)
i = i - 1
p = range(1, n + 1)
for k in range(1, n + 1):
    f = factorial(n - k)
    d = i // f
    (print(p[d]),)
    p.remove(p[d])
    i = i % f
```

Let's identify some potential issues:

1. **Use of `raw_input()`**: The function `raw_input()` is used in Python 2, while the problem description seems to imply Python 3 where `input()` should be used. This will lead to a `NameError` in Python 3.

2. **Return of permutations**: The way the program prints the permutations might not correctly form the complete permutation array. The use of `(print(p[d]),)` is not the conventional way to print out multiple values; it will print each value on a new line instead of forming a complete list.

3. **Handling of `m`**: The program assumes that `m` is always valid without checking if `m` exceeds the total number of permutations. If `m` is larger than the number of permutations, the program will not handle that case correctly, leading to an index error or unexpected behavior.

4. **Lexicographical Order**: While the program aims to generate permutations in lexicographical order by removing elements from the list, there is no guarantee that the resulting output will be in the correct order if `m` is not managed correctly.

5. **Missing Imports**: The program does not import the `factorial` function, which is necessary for its operation. This will also lead to a `NameError`.

Given these identified issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
