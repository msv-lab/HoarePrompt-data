To assess the correctness of the provided program, we begin by analyzing the problem description and the code itself.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires generating the lexicographically m-th permutation of numbers from 1 to n, given that we need to maximize the sum defined as f(p). The constraints state that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n. The output must be the m-th permutation when sorted lexicographically.

### Code Analysis
The program processes the input to extract `n` and `m`, and it calculates the m-th permutation as follows:
1. It converts the input values to integers.
2. It initializes a range of numbers from 1 to n.
3. It loops through the range to build the permutation using factorial calculations to determine the index of the next number to select.
4. It prints each selected number in sequence.

### Edge Case Consideration
1. **Invalid Input Handling:** The program does not handle cases where `m` exceeds the total number of permutations (which is `n!`). If `m` is greater than `n!`, the code will still attempt to generate a permutation without any checks, which can lead to incorrect behavior or errors.
2. **Single Element Case:** For `n = 1`, the output should be straightforward (the only permutation is `1`), and the code handles this case correctly.
3. **General Case:** The code is designed to calculate permutations correctly for valid inputs, but we need to ensure it doesn't produce incorrect outputs for any valid values of `m`.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints indicate that the function does not handle invalid input cases or cases where `m` exceeds the number of permutations, which aligns with our previous finding.

### Conclusion
Given that the output hints suggest that the code does not handle cases where `m` exceeds the number of permutations, and since the problem description requires the program to handle all valid inputs correctly, we can conclude that the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirement for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to ensure that `m` does not exceed `n!`, which is a critical aspect of the problem description.
