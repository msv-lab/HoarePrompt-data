The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i % f`. However, the initial value of `i` is undefined in the provided state. Given that `f` is equal to `factorial(n - 3)`, `f` is a defined positive integer based on user input for `n`. Since `i` is undefined, the state of `i` remains undefined after the operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on user input; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `d` is undefined; `i` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `d` is undefined; `i` is undefined.**
