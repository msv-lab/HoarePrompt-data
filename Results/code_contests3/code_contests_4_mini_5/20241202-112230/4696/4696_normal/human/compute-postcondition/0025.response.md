Functionality: ** The function accepts user input for two positive integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `m`, and calculates the m-th permutation of the integers from 1 to n. It prints each element of the permutation in sequence. However, it does not handle cases where the input is invalid or when `m` exceeds the number of possible permutations (which is n!). The function does not return any value. **
