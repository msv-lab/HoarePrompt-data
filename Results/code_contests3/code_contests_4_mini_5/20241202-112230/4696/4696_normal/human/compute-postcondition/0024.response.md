The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `m` is a positive integer that must also be within the range of 1 to `cntn`, where `cntn` represents the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`. The function does not return any specific output value as it has not been defined in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is related to its internal logic based on the values of `n` and `m`, which are implied to be set elsewhere, but the function itself does not accept these as parameters nor does it explicitly return a value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is defined to work under the constraints of n and m, which are set externally, but it does not return a specific output value.**
