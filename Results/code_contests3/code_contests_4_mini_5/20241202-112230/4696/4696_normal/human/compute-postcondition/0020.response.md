The code attempts to print the value of `p[d]`, but since `d` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable `i`, this results in an error regarding the index `d`. Therefore, the output state highlights that `d` is undefined. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `d` is undefined**.
