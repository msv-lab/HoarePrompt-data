The code attempts to remove an element from the list `p` at the index `d`. However, since `d` cannot be calculated due to the undefined variable `i`, an error occurs when trying to access `p[d]`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, `f`, and `d` remain unchanged, and we note that an error has occurred.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` cannot be calculated; an error occurs when trying to print(p[d]).**
