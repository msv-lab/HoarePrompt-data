The code attempts to remove an element from the list `p` at index `d`. However, since `d` is undefined, this will lead to an error during execution. No changes will occur to the existing variables `n`, `k`, `f`, or `d`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d` is undefined and no operation can be performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `d` is undefined; cannot remove element from p because d is undefined.**
