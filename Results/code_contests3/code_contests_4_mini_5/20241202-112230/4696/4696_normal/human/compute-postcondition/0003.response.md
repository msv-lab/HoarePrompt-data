The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is determined by the user input `b`, which has been converted to an integer. Therefore, after execution, `i` is `int(b) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is user input; `b` is user input; `i` is `int(b) - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is user input; `b` is user input; `i` is `int(b) - 1**
