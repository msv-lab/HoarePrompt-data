The code attempts to print the value of `p[d]`, but since `d` cannot be calculated due to the undefined variable `i`, it results in an error. Therefore, the output state reflects that `d` cannot be determined and no changes are made to the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `d` cannot be calculated since `i` is not defined; an error occurs when trying to print(p[d]).**
