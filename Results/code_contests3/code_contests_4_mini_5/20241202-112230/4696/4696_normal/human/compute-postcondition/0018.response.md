`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 3, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 3)`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `n - 3` will be a non-negative integer (0 or positive). Therefore, the value of `f` will be the factorial of a non-negative integer. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3)**
