`n` is assigned the value `int(a)`, where `a` is obtained from user input and converted to an integer. Since `n` is defined as a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, the value of `n` will now directly depend on the value provided for `a`. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, `a` is user input, `b` is user input**.
