`p` is assigned the value of `range(1, n + 1)`, which generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to `n`. The previous values of `n` depend on user input `a`. Therefore, `p` will contain the integers from 1 to the positive integer value of `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is user input; `b` is user input; `i` is `int(b) - 1; `p` is a range object from 1 to `n + 1**.
