The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. The variable `n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`, and `k` is initialized to 1. Therefore, `n - k` results in `n - 1`. The output state does not depend on the specific value of `n`, but it indicates that `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input `a`; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
