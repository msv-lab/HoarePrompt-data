According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k`, which is iterating from 1 to `n` (inclusive). If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `n` is a positive integer based on user input, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3. The next value of `k` will be 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
