The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the results of `raw_input().split()`, which takes input from the user and splits it into two components. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, and `a`, `b` are assigned values from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, and `a`, `b` are assigned values from user input.**
