The function accepts two implicit parameters, `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 50) and `m` (a positive integer that must be less than or equal to the number of permutations of length `n`). It computes and prints the `m`-th permutation of the numbers from 1 to `n`. The function does this by calculating factorial values and manipulating a list of numbers but does not return any value to the caller.
