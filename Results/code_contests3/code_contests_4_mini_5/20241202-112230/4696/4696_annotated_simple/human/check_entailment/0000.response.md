Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is a Python 2 function. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. This may lead to issues if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Permutation Calculation**: The main logic of the program is to find the m-th lexicographical permutation of numbers from 1 to n that maximizes the value of the function f(p). However, the algorithm does not take into account how to ensure that the permutations being generated actually maximize f(p). The function f(p) is defined based on the sum of the products of indices and values in the permutation. The program should explicitly calculate the optimal permutations that yield the maximum value of f(p) before determining the m-th permutation.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program uses `print(p[d]),` which may lead to outputting each element of the permutation on a separate line instead of on a single line, as expected in the output format specified.

4. **Logic Flaw**: The program does not actually ensure it generates only the permutations that yield the maximum value of f(p). The problem states that only permutations that maximize f(p) should be considered, and the logic for this is missing.

5. **Understanding of Factorials**: The calculation of `f` (factorial) and how it influences the index `i` needs to be clearly defined to ensure that the correct permutation is being selected.

Due to these reasons, the program does not fulfill the criteria defined in the problem description and can lead to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
