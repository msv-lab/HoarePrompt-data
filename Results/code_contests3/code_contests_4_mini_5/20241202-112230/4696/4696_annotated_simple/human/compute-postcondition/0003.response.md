The value of `i` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is an input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input; `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is an input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input; `i` is decreased by 1.**
