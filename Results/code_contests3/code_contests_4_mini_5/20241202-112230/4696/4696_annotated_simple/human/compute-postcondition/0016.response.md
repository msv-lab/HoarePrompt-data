The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is factorial(n - 2). However, since `d` is undefined, it causes an error during execution. Therefore, the values of `n`, `k`, and `f` remain unchanged, but the execution cannot proceed due to the error with `d`. The output state reflects that there is an error due to `d` being undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); error occurs due to `d` being undefined.**
