To execute the code `d = i // f`, we first need to identify the values of the variables involved. 

1. The variable `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 3)`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50. Therefore, `f` will be the factorial of `n - 3`.
2. The variable `i` has not been defined in the initial state provided, so we cannot determine its value.

Since we cannot compute `d` without knowing the value of `i`, we can conclude that the state of the variables remains unchanged, but we cannot perform the operation to define `d`.

The output state will reflect the inability to determine `d` due to the undefined `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is undefined**
