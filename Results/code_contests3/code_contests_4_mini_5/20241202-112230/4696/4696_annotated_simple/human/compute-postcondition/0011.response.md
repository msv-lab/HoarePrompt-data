According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts with `k` equal to 1, and since `k` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to determine the new value of `k` for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 2, and it must still satisfy the condition `k <= n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `k` is now 2.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- The values of `i`, `f`, `d`, and the list `p` might have been modified in the loop body, but since they are not directly tied to whether the loop continues or not, we will not change them for this check.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 1), `d` is the result of i // f, `i` is updated to i % f, `p[d]` is removed from list `p`**
