The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is a string from input. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, the value of `a` must represent a valid integer within that range. The previous values of `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is the input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is the input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input.**
