The variable `i` is assigned the value `i % f`. However, since `i` is undefined, this operation cannot be completed successfully. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `f`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `i` remains undefined and that there is an error due to the undefined variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3); `i` is undefined; an error occurs due to the undefined variable `i`.**
