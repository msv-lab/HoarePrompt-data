According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 through `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
