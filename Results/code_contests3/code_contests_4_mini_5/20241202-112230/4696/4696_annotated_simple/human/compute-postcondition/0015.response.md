The code attempts to execute `p.remove(p[d])`, where `d` is undefined. This will raise an error due to the reference to `d`. Other variables are not affected and retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state reflects the error encountered.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `d` is undefined; `i` is updated to `i % f`; an error occurs due to `d` being undefined.**
