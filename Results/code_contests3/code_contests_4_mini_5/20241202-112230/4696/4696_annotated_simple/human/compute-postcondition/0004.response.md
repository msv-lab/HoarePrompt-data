The variable `p` is assigned the range of numbers from 1 to `n + 1`. This means that `p` will be a range object that includes all integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`. Other variables (`m`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is an input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input; `i` is decreased by 1; `p` is a range object from 1 to `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is an input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input; `i` is decreased by 1; `p` is a range object from 1 to `n + 1.**
