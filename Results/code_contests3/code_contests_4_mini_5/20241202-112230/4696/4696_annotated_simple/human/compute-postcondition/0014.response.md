The code attempts to print `p[d]`, but since `d` is undefined, this will lead to an error. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2); `d` is undefined; `i` is updated to `i % f`, and an error occurs due to `d` being undefined.
