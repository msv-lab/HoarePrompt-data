The value of `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 3, we have `f = factorial(n - 3)`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50 and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3, the value of `n` must be at least 3 for the calculation to proceed. Therefore, `n - 3` will be a non-negative integer.

The output state reflects the assignment of `f` based on the value of `n`. Therefore, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 3; `f` is factorial(n - 3)**.
