The code snippet `a, b = raw_input().split()` takes a single input line and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to variable `a` and the second part to variable `b`. The initial state does not affect the variables `n` and `m`, but it introduces two new variables based on user input.

Since `a` and `b` will hold the values from the input, their exact values will depend on what the user provides. However, we can note that `a` and `b` will be strings resulting from the split operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is a string from input; `b` is a string from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is a string from input; `b` is a string from input.**
