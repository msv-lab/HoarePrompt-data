To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the provided loop and the given states.

1. The loop executes `n` times, with `k` ranging from 1 to `n`.
2. For each iteration, the following occurs:
   - `f` is calculated as `factorial(n - k)`.
   - `d` is determined by integer division of `i` by `f`.
   - The value at index `d` in the list `p` is printed and then removed.
   - `i` is updated to `i % f`.

Since the loop continues until `k` reaches `n`, it will execute exactly `n` times assuming `i` is defined and has suitable values throughout the loop. However, the output states indicate that `i` becomes undefined during the second and third iterations, leading to an error.

Given that the loop is expected to execute `n` times, but errors occur due to undefined variables, we need to conclude what state `i`, `p`, and other variables will have by the end of the loop.

After all iterations:
- `n` will remain the same as it is a constant input.
- `k` will have executed up to `n`, meaning after the final iteration, `k` will be `n + 1`, but the last valid value of `k` used will be `n`.
- The variable `f` will have been calculated for `k = n`, resulting in `f = factorial(0)`, which is 1.
- The variable `d` will be the final calculated index based on the last defined value of `i`, but since `i` becomes undefined during the iterations, it cannot be reliably defined.
- The list `p` will have `n` elements removed (if `d` was defined) or will remain unchanged if the removal fails due to errors.

Since the loop cannot complete successfully due to the errors, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is `n + 1`; `p` is a list with an undefined number of elements removed; `i` is undefined; `f` is 1.**
