`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 1, this means `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - 1)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, so `n - 1` will range from 0 to 49. Therefore, `f` will be the factorial of a number between 0 and 49. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
