The variable `i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`, where `b` is a string input. The specific value of `b` is not provided, but it will be converted to an integer, and the output state will reflect that. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is an input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input; `i` is the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`; `a` is an input string interpreted as an integer; `b` is a string from input; `i` is the integer value of `b`.**
