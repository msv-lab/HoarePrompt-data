According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined to be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The provided state indicates that `i` is decreased by 1, but this does not affect the loop execution directly, as `i` is not part of the loop condition. 

For the loop to execute, `k` will start at 1 and iterate up to `n`. Therefore, `k` will be 1 during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
