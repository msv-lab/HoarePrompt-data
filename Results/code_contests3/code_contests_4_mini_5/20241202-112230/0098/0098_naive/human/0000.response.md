To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and its logic.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the side length of the smallest square that can embed a regular polygon with `2n` vertices (where `n` is an odd integer). The output must be a real number with a precision that does not exceed an absolute or relative error of \(10^{-6}\).

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))

for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))
```

### Evaluation:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `T` for the number of test cases and then reads `n` for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Mathematical Calculation**: The function `func_1(n)` is supposed to calculate the side length of the square required to embed the `2n`-gon.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \frac{\cos(\frac{\pi}{4n})}{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2n})}
     \]
   - This formula needs to be validated against the geometric properties of a `2n`-gon.

### Correctness Check:
- The formula used in `func_1(n)` seems to be derived from the geometry of the regular `2n`-gon. To verify the correctness, we can check specific values of `n`:
  - For `n = 3`, the expected output (from the example) is approximately `1.931851653`.
  - For `n = 5`, the expected output is approximately `3.196226611`.
  - For `n = 199`, the expected output is approximately `126.687663595`.

### Potential Cases:
- The program uses `xrange`, which is valid in Python 2 but would raise an error in Python 3 (where `xrange` is replaced by `range`). This means that the program is not compatible with Python 3.
- Another concern is the precision of the output. The program formats the output to 9 decimal places, which meets the precision requirement of \(10^{-6}\).

### Conclusion:
Due to the incompatibility with Python 3 and the potential for runtime errors if executed in a Python 3 environment, the program does not fulfill the problem description universally. 

Thus, the evaluation results in:
Correctness: **False**.
