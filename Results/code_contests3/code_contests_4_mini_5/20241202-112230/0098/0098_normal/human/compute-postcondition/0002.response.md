Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 199) and returns the result of `cos(π / (4 * n))` divided by `sin(π / (2 * n))`. It does not handle cases where `sin(π / (2 * n))` might be zero, which could lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, the function may not be defined for certain values of `n` that could result in this situation.**
