#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199, and T is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 200.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)), where n is a positive odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 199) and returns the result of `cos(π / (4 * n))` divided by `sin(π / (2 * n))`. It does not handle cases where `sin(π / (2 * n))` might be zero, which could lead to a division by zero error. Therefore, the function may not be defined for certain values of `n` that could result in this situation.
