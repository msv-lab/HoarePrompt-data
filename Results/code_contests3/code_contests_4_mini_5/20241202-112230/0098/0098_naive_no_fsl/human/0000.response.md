Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong mathematical formula to compute the side length of the square in which the 2n-gon can be embedded. Specifically, the formula used in `func_1` is not appropriate for an odd-sided polygon with 2n vertices. 

To clarify:

1. The problem specifies that we need to embed a 2n-gon, which has 2n vertices, not an n-gon. The calculation for the minimum square side length needs to take into account the geometry of a 2n-gon.
   
2. The formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` does not correctly compute the required side length for a square embedding of a 2n-gon. 

For example, if we take n = 3, the expected side of the square to embed a 6-gon (2n = 6) is approximately 2.598076211, while the program will return a different value, indicating that the logic is flawed. 

Hence, for at least one input (n=3), the output will not match the expected result, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
