#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199, and T is a positive integer such that 1 <= T <= 200, representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of the expression math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199 and returns the value of the mathematical expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases since `n` is guaranteed to be valid as per the provided constraints.
