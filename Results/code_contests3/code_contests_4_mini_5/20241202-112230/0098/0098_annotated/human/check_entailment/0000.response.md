To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we first need to analyze both the problem requirements and the program's implementation.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem requires us to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon with **2n** vertices (where **n** is an odd integer). The main requirement is that the output must be a real number for each test case, with an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\).

### Annotated Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1(n)` computes:
```python
return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```
1. It accepts an odd integer `n` such that \(3 \leq n \leq 199\).
2. The expression calculated is mathematically derived to find the appropriate size of the square needed to embed the polygon.

### Mathematical Verification:
For a regular polygon with **2n** sides, the formula used in the function can be derived from geometric considerations of inscribing and circumscribing polygons:
- The value returned by the function represents the ratio of the cosine and sine functions, which is inherently linked to the angles formed by the vertices of the polygon and the square.

The formula indeed gives the necessary side length of the square that can enclose the 2n-gon. This means:
- The formula correctly computes the side length required to embed the polygon based on the angle measures corresponding to its vertices.

### Conclusion:
Since the function `func_1(n)` meets the mathematical requirements to calculate the square's side length for embedding the 2n-gon, it satisfies the problem's constraints and output requirements. The program correctly handles all cases stated in the problem description, as it is guaranteed that `n` will always be an odd integer within the specified bounds.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
