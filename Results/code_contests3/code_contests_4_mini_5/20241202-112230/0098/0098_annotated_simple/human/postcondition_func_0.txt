The function accepts a single odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199 and returns the result of the mathematical expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no checks for the validity of `n` within the function, assuming that `n` is always a valid input as specified in the precondition.
