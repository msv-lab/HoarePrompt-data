#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a single odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199, and T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 200, representing the number of test cases.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) divided by math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is a single odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single odd integer `n` within the range of 3 to 199 and returns the result of the mathematical expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no checks for the validity of `n` within the function, assuming that `n` is always a valid input as specified in the precondition.
