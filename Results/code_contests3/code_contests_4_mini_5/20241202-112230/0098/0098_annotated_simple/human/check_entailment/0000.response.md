To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we first need to analyze what the program is intended to do based on the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the square of the minimum size such that a regular polygon with \(2 \cdot n\) vertices (a 2n-gon) can be embedded in a square. The input consists of multiple test cases, each providing an odd integer \(n\), and the output should be the minimum length of a side of the square that can contain the 2n-gon.

### Program Analysis:
The annotated program defines a function `func_1(n)`, which calculates:
```python
return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```
1. **Understanding the Mathematical Expression**:
   - The expression \( \frac{\cos(\frac{\pi}{4n})}{\sin(\frac{\pi}{2n})} \) seems to be derived from trigonometric properties related to the geometry of polygons.
   - For a regular polygon with \(2n\) vertices inscribed in a circle, the distance from the center to a vertex can be calculated using trigonometric functions. The side length of the square that can contain this polygon is derived from these distances.

2. **Expected Output**:
   - The output should be a single real number that represents the minimum side length of the square for each test case.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses the correct mathematical properties to find the ratio of the cosine and sine, which should correspond to the necessary value to determine the side length of the square.
   - However, the problem statement asks for the **square of the minimum size**. The function does not square the result of the division, which means it does not meet the requirement of providing the square of the side length.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not return the square of the minimum side length as required by the problem description, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
