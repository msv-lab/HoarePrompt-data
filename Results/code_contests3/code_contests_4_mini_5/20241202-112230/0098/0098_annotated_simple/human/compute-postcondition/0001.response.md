The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a single odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. After executing the function body, it returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a single odd integer `n` within the specified range and return the result of the cosine and sine calculations performed on `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a single odd integer between 3 and 199, and returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) divided by math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)).**
