The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of passengers and an integer `s` representing the top floor. It then collects each passenger's floor number `fi` and their arrival time `ti`. After sorting the passengers based on their floor numbers in descending order, the function calculates the total time taken to accommodate all passengers, considering their arrival times, and prints this total time. The function does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the specified ranges, nor does it handle invalid input types.
