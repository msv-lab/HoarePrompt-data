The code initializes an empty list `p`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `s`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `p` is an empty list**
