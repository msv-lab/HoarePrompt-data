According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`, meaning `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
