`fi` and `ti` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which reads a line of input, splits it into separate strings, and then converts those strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the input is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values for `fi` and `ti`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are input integers from raw_input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are input integers from raw_input**.
