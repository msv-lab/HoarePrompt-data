The variable `time_passed` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `i`, and `p`) are not altered by this assignment, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple and now includes the tuple (0, 0), and `time_passed` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple and now includes the tuple (0, 0), `time_passed` is 0**
