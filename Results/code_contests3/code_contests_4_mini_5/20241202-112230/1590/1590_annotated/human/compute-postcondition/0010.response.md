The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from input, but they are not specified in the initial state. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, and a tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, and a tuple `(fi, ti)` has been appended to the list `p`.**
