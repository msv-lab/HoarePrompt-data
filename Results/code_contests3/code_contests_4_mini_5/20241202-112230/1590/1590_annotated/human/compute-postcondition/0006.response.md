The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `fi` and `ti` respectively. The previous state of `n` and `i` remains unchanged since they are not directly affected by this code. However, the values of `fi` and `ti` will depend on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
