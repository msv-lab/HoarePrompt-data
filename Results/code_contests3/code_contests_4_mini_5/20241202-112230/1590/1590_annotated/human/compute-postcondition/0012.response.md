The list `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple (fi) within the list. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but the order of the tuples in `p` is altered based on the sorting criterion. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple.**
