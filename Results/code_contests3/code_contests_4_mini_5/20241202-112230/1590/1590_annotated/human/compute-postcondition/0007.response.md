The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are determined by the input, but the current values of `fi` and `ti` are not specified in the initial state. The list `p` is assumed to exist prior to this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the status of `n`, `i`, and the updated list `p` which now contains the new tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `p` now includes the tuple (fi, ti)**
