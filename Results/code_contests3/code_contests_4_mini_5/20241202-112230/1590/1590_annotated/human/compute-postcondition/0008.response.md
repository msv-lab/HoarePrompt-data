According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is within the range of 1 to 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. The next iteration will increase `i` by 1, making it 2.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
