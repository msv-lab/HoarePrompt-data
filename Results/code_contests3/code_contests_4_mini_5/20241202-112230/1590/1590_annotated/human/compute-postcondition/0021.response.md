According to the code, the loop is designed to execute `n + 1` times, as it starts with `i` at 0 and continues until `i` is equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has executed for the first time. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop iterates from 0 to `n`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue executing.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), in the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple and includes the tuple (0, 0), `s` is assigned the value of `p[0][0]`, if `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is 0.**
