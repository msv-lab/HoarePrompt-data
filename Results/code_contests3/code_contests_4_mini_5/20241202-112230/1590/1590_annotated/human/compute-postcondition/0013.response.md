The code appends the tuple (0, 0) to the list `p`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple and now includes the tuple (0, 0).

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple and now includes the tuple (0, 0)**
