The expression `time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed` updates the value of `time_passed`. The value of `p[i][1]` is extracted from the sorted list `p`, and the previous value of `time_passed` is unchanged. The new value of `time_passed` will be calculated as follows:

1. `time_passed` is incremented by the difference between `p[i][1]` and its current value, effectively updating `time_passed` to `p[i][1]`.
2. Since `i` is 1, this means we will use the second tuple in `p`, i.e., `p[1]`.

Thus, after this operation, `time_passed` will hold the value of `p[1][1]`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 1, `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple including (0, 0), `s` is `p[1][0]`, `time_passed` is updated to `p[1][1]**.
