The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided as input integers from `raw_input`. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation, and `i` remains unchanged at 0. The list `p` is updated to include the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is 0, `p` is updated to include the tuple `(fi, ti)`**
