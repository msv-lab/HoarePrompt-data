The loop appends `n` tuples of integers `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`, where each tuple is collected from user input. After all iterations of the loop have executed, the list `p` will contain exactly `n` tuples. The variable `i` will equal `n`, and `n` remains unchanged. If the loop executes, the values in `p` will be based on the user input provided during each iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is equal to `n`, `p` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers (fi, ti).**
