The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]` to it. Since `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, the expression simplifies to `time_passed += p[n][0] - p[i][0]`. The previous values indicate that `time_passed` is equal to `p[n][1]` and `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`. Therefore, the new value of `time_passed` will be `p[n][1] + (p[n][0] - p[i][0])`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`time_passed` is updated to `p[n][1] + (p[n][0] - p[i][0])`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
