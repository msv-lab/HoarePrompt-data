The code snippet takes input for the variables `n` and `s` via the `raw_input()` function and splits the input into two integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and `s` is an integer such that \(1 \leq s \leq 1000\). The values of `n` and `s` will be updated based on the user input.

Since the specific values for `n` and `s` are not provided in the initial state and are dependent on external input, we can only state that they will be assigned new integer values from the input. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in variables `n` and `s` after the input, but does not specify their new values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000; new values for `n` and `s` are assigned from input.**
