The code snippet assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by reading input and splitting it into two integers. The current values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown as they depend on the input received, but they will be integers. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**.
