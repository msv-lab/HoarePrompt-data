The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by unpacking the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means it takes input, splits it into components, converts those components to integers, and then assigns the first and second integers to `fi` and `ti`, respectively. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `p` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples including the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2; `fi` and `ti` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples including the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2; `fi` and `ti` are input integers.**
