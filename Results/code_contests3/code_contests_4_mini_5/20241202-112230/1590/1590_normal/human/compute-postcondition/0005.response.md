According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. In this case, `i` is currently 0, which means that it is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute a second time if `n` remains greater than 1. After incrementing, `i` will become 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be greater than 1, and `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
