The values `fi` and `ti` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which is split into two parts and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variables `n`, `s`, `p`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state will reflect the new values of `fi` and `ti`, which are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
