In the given code, `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`. The variable `time_passed` is affected by the expression `s - p[i][0]`, but since `s` is now equal to `p[i][0]`, this results in `time_passed` being increased by `0`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `time_passed` is increased by `0`, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is increased by `0`, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`**
