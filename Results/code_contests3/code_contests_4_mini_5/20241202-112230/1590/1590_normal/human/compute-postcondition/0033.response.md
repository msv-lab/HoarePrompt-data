The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `s` is also an integer representing the number of floors, constrained such that \(1 \leq s \leq 1000\). Additionally, for each passenger, there are two associated integers: `fi`, which represents the floor number and is constrained such that \(1 \leq fi \leq s\), and `ti`, which represents the arrival time and is constrained such that \(1 \leq ti \leq 1000\). 

The function processes this information and based on the provided input, it will output a result. However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in the task. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept the integer parameters `n` and `s`, along with the associated integers for each passenger's floor and arrival time, and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (number of passengers) and `s` (number of floors), along with each passenger's floor `fi` and arrival time `ti`, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
