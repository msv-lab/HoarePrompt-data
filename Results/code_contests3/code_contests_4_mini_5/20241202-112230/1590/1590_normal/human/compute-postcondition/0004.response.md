`p` is an empty list, and we are appending a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to it. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided as input integers, so after the execution, `p` will contain one tuple: `(fi, ti)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains one tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 0, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
