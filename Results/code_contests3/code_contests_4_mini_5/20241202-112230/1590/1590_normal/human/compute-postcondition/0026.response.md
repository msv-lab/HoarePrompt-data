According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is incremented in each iteration of the for loop. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`, since the range is from `0` to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `time_passed` has been increased by 0, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`, and if `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, it has been set to `p[i][1]`. This implies that we are currently at index `i` for the last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, which means `n` must be at least `n + 1`.

State: **`time_passed` is equal to `p[n][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be equal to `n`**
