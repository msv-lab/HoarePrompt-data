The code `p.append((fi, ti))` adds a new tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are input integers, but their specific values are not disclosed in the initial state. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that a new tuple has been added to `p`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains three tuples including the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2**
