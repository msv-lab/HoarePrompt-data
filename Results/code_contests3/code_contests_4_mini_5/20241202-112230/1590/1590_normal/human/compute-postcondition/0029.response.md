The value of `time_passed` is updated by adding `p[i][1] - time_passed` to its current value. We know that `s` equals `p[i][0]`, which is the same as `p[n][0]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `p[i][1]` is the same as `p[n][1]`. 

Now, substituting the known values:
- `time_passed` gets updated to `time_passed + (p[n][1] - time_passed)`.

The resulting value of `time_passed` will effectively become `p[n][1]` because `time_passed` cancels itself out in the operation, leaving just `p[n][1]`.

Thus, the output state remains with the updated value of `time_passed`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`time_passed` is now `p[n][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[n][0]`, `i` is equal to `n`**.
