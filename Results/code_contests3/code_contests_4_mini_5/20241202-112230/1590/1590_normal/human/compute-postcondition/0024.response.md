`time_passed` is updated by adding the difference of `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. Since `time_passed` is initially increased by `0`, its value remains unchanged after the code execution. The state of `s` is based on `p[i][0]` and is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is equal to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`.

Output State: **`time_passed` is equal to `p[i][1]`, `s` is equal to `p[i][0]`**
