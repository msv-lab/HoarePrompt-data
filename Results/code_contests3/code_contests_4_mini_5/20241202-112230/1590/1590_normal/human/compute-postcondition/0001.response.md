The code initializes an empty list `p`, and the previous values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000; `p` is an empty list**.
