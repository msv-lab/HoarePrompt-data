Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (number of passengers) and `s` (number of floors), and a list of tuples containing each passenger's floor `fi` and arrival time `ti`. It calculates the total time passed based on the passengers' floors and their respective arrival times, returning the final calculated time. The function also ensures that the time passed does not fall short of any passenger's arrival time.**
