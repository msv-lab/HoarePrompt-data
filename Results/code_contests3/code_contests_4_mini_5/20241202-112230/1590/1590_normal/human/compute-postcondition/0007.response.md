`p` is modified to include a new tuple `(fi, ti)`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided as inputs, and since `p` already contains one tuple, it will now contain two tuples after the execution of the code. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples including the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples including the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 1**
