According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` contains two tuples including the new tuple `(fi, ti)`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
