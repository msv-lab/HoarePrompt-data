According to the code, the loop will iterate from 0 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will execute `n + 1` times. The variable `i` is initialized to `n`, but it will be reassigned during the loop execution. The important aspect here is to ensure that the loop can start executing correctly.

Since `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop, we need to adjust it to match the first value in the range, which is `0`, for the loop to execute the first time. 

So, for the loop to execute:
- We need to establish that `n` is within the range specified (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100).
- The starting value of `i` for the loop is effectively `0` on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `p` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, `i` is now 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and `time_passed` is 0.**
