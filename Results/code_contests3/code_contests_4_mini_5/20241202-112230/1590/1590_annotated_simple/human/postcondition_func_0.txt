The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of passengers and a positive integer `s` representing the top floor number. It reads `n` pairs of integers representing each passenger's floor number and arrival time, sorts the passengers by their floor number in descending order, and calculates the total time taken to reach all passengers, considering their respective arrival times. Finally, it prints the total time passed, which includes waiting for passengers if the elevator arrives before them. If there are no passengers or if the inputs do not meet the specified constraints, the function will still execute but may not behave as intended in terms of logical validity.
