The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are determined by user input, but the specific values are not provided in the initial state. The variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, and `p` is updated to include the tuple `(fi, ti)` from user input.**
