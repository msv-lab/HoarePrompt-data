The code assigns the values provided by the user input to `fi` and `ti`, using `map(int, raw_input().split())` to convert the input into two integer values. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` are now assigned input values, but their specific values depend on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
