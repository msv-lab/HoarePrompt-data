The code initializes an empty list `p`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is a positive integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `p` is an empty list**.
