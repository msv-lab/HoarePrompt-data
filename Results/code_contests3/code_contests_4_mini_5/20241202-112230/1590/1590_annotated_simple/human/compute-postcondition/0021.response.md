According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `i` will become 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again as `i` (1) is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
