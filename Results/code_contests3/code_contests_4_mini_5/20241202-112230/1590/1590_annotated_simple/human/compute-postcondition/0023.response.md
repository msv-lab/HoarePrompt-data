`p[i][0]` is accessed, where `i` is currently 1. Therefore, `s` is assigned the value `p[1][0]`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `i` is 1, the state of the other variables is not affected directly by this assignment. The output state reflects the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `s` is assigned the value of `p[1][0]**
