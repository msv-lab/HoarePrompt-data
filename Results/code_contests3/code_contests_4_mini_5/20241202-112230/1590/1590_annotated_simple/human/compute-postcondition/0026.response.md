According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. 

Since `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
