According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
