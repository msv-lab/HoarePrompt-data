Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element in descending order, `time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + s - p[0][0]`, `s` is equal to the first element of the first tuple in `p`, and `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`.***
