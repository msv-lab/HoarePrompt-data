The code `p.append((fi, ti))` appends a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The values of `n`, `i`, `fi`, and `ti` are unchanged by this operation, but the list `p` will now contain an additional element, which is the tuple `(fi, ti)`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `p` has been updated with this new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer, and `p` now contains an additional tuple (fi, ti)**.
