The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and a list of tuples representing the passengers' details. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of passengers, constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `s` is a positive integer representing the top floor number, constrained to the range 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000. Each passenger's details consist of a floor number `fi` and an arrival time `ti`, where each `fi` is a positive integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ fi ≤ s and each `ti` is a positive integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000.

The function processes these inputs and generates an output based on the passengers' arrival times and their respective floor numbers. However, the specific output behavior is not provided in the initial description. Therefore, based on the provided constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer n representing the number of passengers, a positive integer s representing the top floor number, and a list of tuples containing each passenger's floor number and arrival time.**
