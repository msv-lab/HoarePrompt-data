The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by reading input from the user and splitting it into two integers. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 and does not directly affect the values of `fi` and `ti`, we can conclude that the values of `fi` and `ti` will be based on user input. The previous value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `fi` and `ti` are determined by user input while `n` and `i` retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are determined by user input**
