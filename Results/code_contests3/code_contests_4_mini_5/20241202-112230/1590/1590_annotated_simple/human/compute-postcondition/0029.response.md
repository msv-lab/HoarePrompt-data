The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference `p[i][1] - time_passed` to its current value. The value of `p[i][1]` depends on the value of `i`, which is 2, so `p[2][1]` will be used. The state of the other variables, including `n`, `s`, and the unchanged `time_passed`, is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State indicates the new state of `time_passed` after the modification.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `i` is 2; `s` is assigned the value of `p[2][0]; `time_passed` is updated to `time_passed + (p[2][1] - time_passed)`.**
