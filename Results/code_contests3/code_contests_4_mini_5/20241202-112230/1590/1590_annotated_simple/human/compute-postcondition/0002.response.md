According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` is already valid, and `i` will initialize to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
