The code appends the tuple (0, 0) to the list `p`. Since `p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element in descending order, the addition of (0, 0) will not affect the order of the existing tuples because its first element (0) is less than all the first elements of the tuples already in the list. The values of `n` and the existing tuples in `p` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100; `p` is a sorted list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple in descending order, with (0, 0) appended at the end.**
