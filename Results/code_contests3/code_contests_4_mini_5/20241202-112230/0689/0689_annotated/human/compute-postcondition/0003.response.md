The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they have the same length, which is between 2 and 100 characters. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot determine specific return values or conditions based on the parameters. Therefore, we can only note the input constraints and relationships.
