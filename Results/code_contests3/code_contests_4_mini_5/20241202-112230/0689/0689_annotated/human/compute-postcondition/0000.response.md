The variable `s` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which means it takes input from the user as a string. The initial states of `S` and `T` remain unchanged, and the length of `s` will be between 2 and 100 characters, consistent with the lengths of `S` and `T`. Thus, the output state reflects that `s` is now a string input from the user.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `T` is a string; `s` is an input string from the user**
