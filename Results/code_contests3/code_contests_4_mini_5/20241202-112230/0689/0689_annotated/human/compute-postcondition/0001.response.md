The variable `t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string from the user. The previous states of `S`, `T`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string, `T` is a string; `s` is an input string from the user; `t` is an input string from the user.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `T` is a string; `s` is an input string from the user; `t` is an input string from the user.**
