Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it uses `raw_input()` for input, which is not valid in Python 3. In Python 3, the correct function for input is `input()`. Additionally, the output format specified in the problem description requires printing "Yes" or "No", but the program attempts to use a list to index the result instead of directly printing the strings. This could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Furthermore, the overall logic of checking for string rotation is implemented correctly, but the input handling and output formatting do not adhere to the specified requirements. If the function is run in a Python 3 environment, it will raise a `NameError` due to `raw_input()` not being defined. 

Thus, the function does not correctly implement the problem description as it stands, especially regarding input and output handling.
