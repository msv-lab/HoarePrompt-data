Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to check if string `S` can be made equal to string `T` through rotations. However, there is a significant issue with the implementation. 

The line `print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]` uses the `any` function to check if any of the rotations of string `T` (generated by slicing) matches string `S`. However, the program is incorrectly using `print` with square brackets instead of parentheses, which would lead to a syntax error. 

Additionally, the logic of the slicing operation could potentially miss some edge cases due to the incorrect use of parentheses, which may lead to unexpected behavior. 

For example, if `S` is "abc" and `T` is "abc", the program will return "Yes" (which is correct), but if `S` is "abc" and `T` is "acb", it will incorrectly evaluate rotations and return "No", which is also correct. However, the program's syntax error would prevent it from executing altogether.

To summarize, because of the syntax error and potential logic mishaps, the program does not adhere to the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the answer is **False**.
