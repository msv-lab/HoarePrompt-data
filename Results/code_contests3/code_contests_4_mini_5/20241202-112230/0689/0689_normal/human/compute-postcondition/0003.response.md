The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100 characters, and the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal. The function performs a comparison or transformation based on these two strings. However, the specifics of the output or return value are not provided in the prompt. 

Given the constraints and relationships:
- If `S` and `T` are manipulated or compared in some way, the return value could depend on that operation.

Since the output details are missing, we cannot specify the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can only be partially described at this stage. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, S and T, which are equal-length strings of lowercase English letters. The specific return value is not provided.**
