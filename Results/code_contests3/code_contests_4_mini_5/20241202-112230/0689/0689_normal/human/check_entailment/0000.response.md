To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
We need to determine if the string `S` equals the string `T` after performing a rotation operation on `S`. The rotation operation involves moving the last character of `S` to the front.

### Program Analysis:
The given code is:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```
- The code reads two strings, `s` and `t`.
- It checks if `s` can be formed by rotating `t` using a generator expression that checks all possible rotations of `t`.
- It returns 'Yes' if `s` is a rotation of `t`, and 'No' otherwise.

### Edge Case Considerations:
1. **Minimum Length Constraint**: Both strings must be at least 2 characters long. This constraint is respected in the problem description.
2. **Identical Strings**: If `S` and `T` are identical (e.g., "abc" and "abc"), the output should be 'Yes'.
3. **Single Rotation**: If `T` is such that a single rotation can yield `S` (e.g., `S = "abc"` and `T = "cab"`), it should return 'Yes'.
4. **Not a Rotation**: If `S` cannot be achieved by any rotation of `T`, it should return 'No' (e.g., `S = "abc"` and `T = "def"`).

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`, which aligns with the code's logic. However, the hints also mention that the function does not handle potential errors related to input validity or unexpected formats. This is a point of concern but does not directly affect the correctness of the algorithm regarding valid inputs.

### Final Assessment:
- The program correctly identifies if `S` can be achieved by rotating `T` for all potential cases based on the problem description.
- The output hints also align with the logic of the code.

Therefore, I could not find any edge case or example where the program fails to meet the specifications provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
