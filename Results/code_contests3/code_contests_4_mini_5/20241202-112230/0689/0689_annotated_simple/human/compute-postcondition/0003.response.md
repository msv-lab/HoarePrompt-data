The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and they both have a length between 2 and 100, inclusive, with the condition that the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal (|S| = |T|). The specific output behavior of the function based on these parameters is not provided, so we cannot determine the return value or any case distinctions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two equal-length strings, `S` and `T`, consisting of lowercase English letters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `S` and `T`, which are strings of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters.**
