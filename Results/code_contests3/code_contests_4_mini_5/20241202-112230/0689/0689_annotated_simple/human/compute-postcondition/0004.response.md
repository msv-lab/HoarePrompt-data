The function `func` accepts two strings `s` and `t`, both consisting of lowercase English letters and having equal lengths between 2 and 100 characters. It checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t`. The function does this by concatenating `t` with itself and checking if `s` is a substring of this concatenated string. If `s` can be formed by rotating `t`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". 

However, the annotations incorrectly indicate that the function accepts parameters `S` and `T`, while in reality, it reads the strings from user input. This means the function does not take parameters in the traditional sense, which is a significant discrepancy. 

Functionality: ** The function reads two strings `s` and `t` from user input, checks if `s` is a rotation of `t`, and prints "Yes" if it is, or "No" if it is not. **
