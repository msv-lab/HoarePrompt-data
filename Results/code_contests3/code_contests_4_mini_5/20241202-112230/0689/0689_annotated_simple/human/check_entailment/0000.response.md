Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The issue lies in how the program checks for string rotation.

1. The function uses `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` to determine if `s` is a rotation of `t`. This part of the code generates all possible rotations of `t` by slicing it in different ways and checking if any of these rotations match `s`. This logic does work correctly; however, the program prints "Yes" for a match and "No" for no match, which is not in line with the expected output format of "Yes" or "No".

2. The program uses `print['No', 'Yes']` which is incorrect syntax for the `print` function in Python. The correct way to print would be `print(['No', 'Yes'][...])`, but this still does not align with the expected output format required by the problem statement.

Because of these issues, the program does not fully conform to the problem description in terms of output format and correctness of the print statement. Thus, it fails to satisfy the requirements for all potential cases.
