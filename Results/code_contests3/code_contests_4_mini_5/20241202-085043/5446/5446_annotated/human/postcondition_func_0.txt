The function accepts three integers `n`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then computes the required number of pieces based on `n` and prints the ceiling of that result. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The function assumes that the input values for `n`, `b`, and `c` are provided correctly, but there are no checks for input validity or edge cases such as division by zero, as `min(b, c)` will always be non-zero given the constraints.
