The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it relies on the external variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100). The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the given constraints, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function relies on external variables n, a, and b, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer between 1 and 100 representing pieces of the first cake, and b is an integer between 1 and 100 representing pieces of the second cake. The exact return value is not specified.**
