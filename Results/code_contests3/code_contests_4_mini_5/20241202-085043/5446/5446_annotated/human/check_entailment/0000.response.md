The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Below are the reasons for this determination:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func()` is supposed to accept three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `a` represents the pieces of the first cake and `b` represents the pieces of the second cake). However, it reads `n`, `b`, and `c`, with `c` being undefined in the context of the problem. This leads to confusion and incorrect functionality since `c` should actually represent `a`.

2. **Logic Error**: The calculation of `x` as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not align with the requirement to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate. The problem asks for distributing the pieces such that each plate has at least `x` pieces, but the formula used does not ensure that the pieces are distributed in accordance with the constraints provided (i.e., no plate containing pieces from both cakes, and each plate having at least one piece).

3. **Output**: The formula `ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)` does not accurately compute the maximum possible number `x` as defined in the problem. The output does not reflect the maximum number of pieces that can be placed on each plate while satisfying all conditions.

4. **Assumption of Input Validity**: The program assumes that the input values will be valid and does not handle potential edge cases or input validation, although it is stated that the constraints ensure valid inputs.

Given these issues, the program does not consistently adhere to the problem description nor does it correctly compute the desired output for given input values.

Correctness: **False**
