To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem requirements and the code logic.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Each piece of each cake must be placed on some plate.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate can contain pieces of both cakes.
4. We need to determine the maximum possible number `x` such that each plate contains at least `x` pieces of cake.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input: `n` (number of plates), `b` (pieces of the first cake), and `c` (pieces of the second cake). However, it incorrectly assigns `b` and `c` from the input, as it should be `a` and `b` based on the problem description.

2. **Calculation of `x`**:
   - `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`: This line is incorrect due to logical issues in the context of the problem. The maximum number of pieces each plate can have is not derived this way. Instead, we should be focusing on distributing pieces evenly across the plates.
   - The logic does not take into account the constraints that pieces must be distributed such that every plate has at least one piece, and maximizes the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))`: This calculation is also flawed. It attempts to calculate the distribution based on the wrong `x` value previously computed and does not accurately reflect the number of pieces distributed to each plate.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description. The logic for calculating the maximum possible `x` is incorrect as it does not guarantee that all conditions from the problem statement are met. Specifically, it fails to ensure that:
- Each plate gets at least one piece.
- The pieces are distributed in a way to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate.

### Final Verdict:
Correctness: **False**
