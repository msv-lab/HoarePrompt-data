To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the effects of the code on the variables based on the initial state. The key steps are as follows:

1. The variables `b` and `c` are assigned new integer values from input.
2. The value of `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.
3. The expression `min(b, c) / float(n) * x` is computed.
4. The final result is passed to `ceil()` and then converted to an integer before being printed.

Given that `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are all affected by user input, and without specific values for `b` and `c`, we cannot compute exact numerical results. However, we can describe the transformations and relationships between the variables.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100; `b` is an integer from input; `c` is an integer from input; `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`; the final result is printed as an integer after applying `ceil()` to the expression `min(b, c) / float(n) * x`.**
