The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` and `b` are integers constrained to \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). 

The output of the function is not provided in the prompt, so we cannot determine what the function returns based solely on the information given. Therefore, we cannot summarize the functionality effectively without additional details about the output or behavior of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates under the constraints that n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, where a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The specific output of the function is not defined.**
