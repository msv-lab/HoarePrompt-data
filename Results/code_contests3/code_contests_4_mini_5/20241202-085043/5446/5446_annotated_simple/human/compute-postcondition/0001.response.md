To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

1. **Variables Defined**: 
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). 
   - `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\).
   - `b` and `c` are assigned new integer values from input.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` computes the value of `x`.
   - `max(b, c)` will return the maximum of the two integer values `b` and `c`.
   - `min(b, c)` will return the minimum of the two integer values `b` and `c`.
   - The division of `max(b, c)` by `float(min(b, c))` will yield a float result for `x`.

3. **Implications**:
   - The value of `x` is defined based on the values of `b` and `c` after they are inputted.
   - Since `b` and `c` are assigned new values from input, their specific values will determine `x`.
   - Other variables (`n`, `a`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `b` and `c` are new integers from input, and `x` is calculated based on those values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ 100; `b` is a new integer from input; `c` is a new integer from input; `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.**
