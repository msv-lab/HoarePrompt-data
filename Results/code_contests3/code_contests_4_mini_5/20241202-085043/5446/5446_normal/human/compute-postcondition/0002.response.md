To determine the output state based on the provided code snippet, letâ€™s break it down step by step:

1. **Understanding the variables:**
   - `n` is the number of plates (an integer).
   - `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of pieces of the first cake and the second cake, respectively.
   - `x` is calculated as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`, where `c` is not defined in the initial state provided.

2. **Analyzing the code:**
   - The code executes `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))`.
   - Inside the `ceil` function, `min(b, c)` is divided by `float(n)`, and then multiplied by `x`.

3. **Possible issues:**
   - Since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot compute `x` accurately. Therefore, the calculations involving `min(b, c)` and `max(b, c)` are not possible without knowing the value of `c`.

Given that we cannot determine the output of the code due to the undefined variable `c`, the output state reflects this uncertainty.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `a` is an integer; `b` is an integer; `x` cannot be determined due to undefined variable `c`.**
