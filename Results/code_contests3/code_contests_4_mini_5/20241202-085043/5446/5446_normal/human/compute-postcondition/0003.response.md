The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, and it must satisfy the condition \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \). The parameter `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, constrained such that \( 1 \leq a \leq 100 \). The parameter `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, with the constraint \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \). 

The function's output is determined based on the values of these parameters, although the specific return points and their conditions were not provided in your prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (number of plates), an integer `a` (pieces of the first cake), and an integer `b` (pieces of the second cake), with respective constraints on their values.**
