#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of plates (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).
def func():
    n, b, c = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
    print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer inputs: `n`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` represents the number of plates, `b` and `c` represent the number of pieces of two cakes. It computes a value based on the ratio of the maximum to minimum pieces of cake and calculates how many pieces of cake are needed per plate, returning the ceiling of that value. However, it does not utilize the variable `a` in its logic, which is mentioned in the annotations but has no effect on the function's execution. Additionally, there is an assumption that at least one of `b` or `c` is non-zero, but the function does not handle cases where both could be zero, which may lead to a division by zero error.
