Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are some specific issues and a counterexample:

1. The program calculates `x` incorrectly. It uses the formula `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`, which does not correspond to the goal of maximizing the minimum number of pieces on a plate.
2. The program does not ensure that each plate contains at least one piece of cake, nor does it correctly handle the distribution of both cakes across the plates while respecting the constraints mentioned in the problem.
3. The use of `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))` is not appropriate for determining the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed on each plate.

Counterexample:
For input `5 2 3`, the expected output is `1`. However, the program's calculation results in incorrect values due to the flawed logic in calculating `x`.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
