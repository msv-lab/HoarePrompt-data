To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to distribute pieces of two cakes across a certain number of plates while adhering to specified conditions. The main goal is to find the maximum possible number \( x \) such that each plate will contain at least \( x \) pieces of cake.

### Given Program
```python
(n, b, c) = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

### Code Review
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input, but it incorrectly names the second and third inputs as `b` and `c` instead of `a` and `b` as per the problem statement. This can lead to confusion.
  
2. **Logic**:
   - `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`: This line calculates the ratio of the larger number of pieces to the smaller number of pieces. However, this does not directly relate to how many pieces can be distributed per plate, which is the crux of the problem.
   - `min(b, c) / float(n) * x`: This is attempting to calculate the minimum pieces per plate multiplied by the previously computed ratio. However, the logic does not guarantee that all plates will contain at least one piece or that no plate contains pieces from both cakes.

### Potential Case Where It Fails
Consider the case where \( n = 3 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( b = 1 \):
- The input would be `3 1 1`.
- According to the problem description, each of the 3 plates must contain at least 1 piece.
- However, the program would compute `x` based on the formula, leading to incorrect output since there aren't enough pieces to distribute to 3 plates.

### Conclusion
Given the issues with input handling and logical flaws in the computation of the maximum number of pieces per plate, the program does not adhere to the requirements presented in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
