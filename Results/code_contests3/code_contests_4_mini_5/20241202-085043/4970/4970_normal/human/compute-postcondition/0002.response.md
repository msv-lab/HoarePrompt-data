The function `func` does not accept any parameters and retrieves an integer input from the user, which is expected to be in the range of 0 to 15. It uses this input as an index to access an element from a predefined list of integers. The list contains the values `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, and it prints the corresponding element based on the user's input. If the input is outside the range of 0 to 15, an `IndexError` will occur due to trying to access an invalid index in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the retrieved value or raises an error.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for an integer input between 0 and 15, prints the corresponding element from a specific list based on that input, and may raise an `IndexError` if the input is out of bounds. **
