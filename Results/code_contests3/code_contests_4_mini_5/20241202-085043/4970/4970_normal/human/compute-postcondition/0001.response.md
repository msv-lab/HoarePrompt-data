The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on an integer `a` that is constrained to the range 0 ≤ a ≤ 15. However, since the function definition does not include `a` as an input parameter, it is unclear how the function utilizes this value or if it even does. As there is no specified output or cases related to the value of `a`, the functionality of the function cannot be determined based on the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined in terms of parameters or return values. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
