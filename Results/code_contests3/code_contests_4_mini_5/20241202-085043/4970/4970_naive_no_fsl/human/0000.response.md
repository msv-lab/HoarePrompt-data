To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code and the expected behavior.

### Problem Description
- Input: A single integer \( a \) where \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \).
- Output: A single integer.

### Example Given
- Input: `3`
- Output: `13`

### Analyzing the Program
The program is:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

1. The program uses a list to map the input integer \( a \) to an output integer.
2. The list is: `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
3. The program retrieves an output by indexing this list with the input value \( a \).

### Validating the Outputs
We can list the outputs for each possible input value from 0 to 15:
- Input 0: Output 15
- Input 1: Output 14
- Input 2: Output 12
- Input 3: Output 13
- Input 4: Output 8
- Input 5: Output 9
- Input 6: Output 10
- Input 7: Output 11
- Input 8: Output 0
- Input 9: Output 1
- Input 10: Output 2
- Input 11: Output 3
- Input 12: Output 4
- Input 13: Output 5
- Input 14: Output 6
- Input 15: Output 7

### Checking Against the Problem Description
- The program correctly accepts an integer \( a \) in the range \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \).
- It outputs a corresponding integer from the predefined list, which is consistent with the expected output for the given example.

### Edge Cases
- The program correctly handles all inputs from 0 to 15, and there are no cases where it would fail to produce an output.

### Conclusion
Since the output for every input in the defined range is correctly handled by the program, and there are no edge cases where it fails, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
