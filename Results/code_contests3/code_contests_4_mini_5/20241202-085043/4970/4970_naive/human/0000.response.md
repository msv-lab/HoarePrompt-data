To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze the behavior of the program against the expected output for all valid input cases.

### Problem Description:
The program is supposed to take a single integer `a` (where \(0 \leq a \leq 15\)) as input and output a corresponding integer from a predefined list.

### Program:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Range**: The input `a` is expected to be within the range of 0 to 15.
2. **Output Correspondence**: The program uses a list with 16 elements, which are indexed from 0 to 15. It retrieves the value at the index specified by the input `a`.

#### List Contents:
- Index 0: 15
- Index 1: 14
- Index 2: 12
- Index 3: 13
- Index 4: 8
- Index 5: 9
- Index 6: 10
- Index 7: 11
- Index 8: 0
- Index 9: 1
- Index 10: 2
- Index 11: 3
- Index 12: 4
- Index 13: 5
- Index 14: 6
- Index 15: 7

### Potential Issues:
The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). If this code is executed in a Python 3 environment, it will raise an error. 

### Specific Test Cases to Consider:
- For input `0`, the expected output is `15`, which is correct.
- For input `1`, the expected output is `14`, which is correct.
- For input `15`, the expected output is `7`, which is correct.

However, if we were to run this in Python 3 without modifying the input function, it would fail due to `raw_input()` being undefined. 

### Conclusion:
Since the program will not work correctly in a Python 3 environment and fails for the input case due to an undefined function, we conclude that the program does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
