Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements because it does not correctly handle the input and output as specified. 

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()` to read the input, which is not compatible with Python 3. In Python 3, `input()` should be used instead. This could lead to a `NameError` if the code is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Output Specification**: The problem description specifies that the output should be a single integer based on the input integer `a`. However, the function prints an element from a predefined list based on user input without explicitly returning a value. Therefore, it does not conform to the expected output format of returning a single integer.

3. **Index Handling**: The function does not handle cases where the input might be outside the specified range (0 ≤ a ≤ 15). Although the problem description states that `a` will always be within this range, the function does not include any checks or error handling, which could lead to an `IndexError` if the input were invalid.

In summary, the program does not correctly implement the requirements as it fails in input handling, output specification, and lacks error handling, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the problem description.
