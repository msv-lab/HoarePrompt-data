The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is implied that it utilizes a single integer `a`, which must satisfy the constraint 0 ≤ a ≤ 15. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact return value based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to be determined based on the integer `a` within the specified range, but since the output is not provided, we cannot conclude what it returns. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates based on an integer `a` within the range 0 to 15, though the return value is not specified.**
