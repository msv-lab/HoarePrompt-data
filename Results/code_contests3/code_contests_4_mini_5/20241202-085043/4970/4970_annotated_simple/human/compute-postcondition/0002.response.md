Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and prints an element from a predefined list based on user input. The input is expected to be a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 15, which corresponds to the indices of the list. If the input is outside this range, the function will raise an IndexError as the list only contains 16 elements (indices 0 to 15). The output of the function is the value at the specified index in the list, but since it does not return a value, it effectively has an undefined return type.**
