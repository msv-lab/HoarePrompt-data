The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work without input, as indicated by the absence of parameters in its definition. The function is expected to handle a non-negative integer `a`, which is constrained within the range of 0 to 15, but since no parameters are accepted, it will likely use a predefined value for `a`. As there are no specific output conditions provided, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is undefined based on the given information.**
