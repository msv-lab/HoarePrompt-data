Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func()` reads an input using `raw_input()`, which is correct for Python 2, but the problem description does not specify the version of Python to be used. Additionally, there is no parameter to the function to accept the integer `a`, which contradicts typical function design.

2. **Output Value**: The program uses a predefined list to index the integer input. The list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` appears to map the integer `a` to specific output values. However, there is a problem with the values being output. 

   - For `a=3`, the program outputs `13`, which matches the expected output in the example given in the problem description.
   - However, for other values of `a`, the outputs do not follow a logical or consistent pattern based on the provided problem description. For example, `a=0` outputs `15`, and `a=1` outputs `14`, which are arbitrary rather than defined by a clear rule or relationship to `a`.

3. **Lack of Clear Mapping**: The problem description does not provide a mapping or relationship for how to compute the output based on the input `a`. The program uses a hardcoded list to determine outputs, which means it cannot adapt to any potential changes in requirements or additional test cases outside the given example.

In conclusion, the program fails to meet the problem requirements due to its arbitrary mapping of input to output and its method of input handling.
