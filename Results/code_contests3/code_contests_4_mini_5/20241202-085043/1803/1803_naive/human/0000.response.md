To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the program.

### Problem Description:
The task is to count the total number of distinct letters in a set represented as a string. The format of the input string is:
- It starts with an opening curly brace `{` and ends with a closing curly brace `}`.
- Letters are small English letters separated by a comma and a space.
- The input can potentially be empty, which should return 0 distinct letters.

### Program Analysis:
```python
Cadena = raw_input()  # reads the input string
Arreglo = []
k = 1
while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:  # ensure the input has letters to process
    Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]  # add the letter at index k to Arreglo
    k = k + 3  # move to the next letter (skipping the comma and space)
print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))  # print the number of distinct letters
```

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of Empty Set**: If the input is `{}`, the `while` loop will not execute, and `Arreglo` will remain empty. However, the program will still attempt to print the length of the set of `Arreglo`, which will correctly return 0. This part is fine.

2. **Indexing**: The program assumes that every letter is followed by a comma and a space. This means it will only work correctly if the input is well-formed according to the problem description. For example, the input `{a, b, c}` will work as expected, but if the input were malformed (e.g., `{a, b, c}` without spaces or commas), it could lead to index errors or incorrect outputs.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop increments `k` by 3 each time, which means it expects a specific format (letter, comma, space). If the input were to contain a malformed sequence or spaces in unexpected places, it could skip letters or cause an index error.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
Consider the input:
```
{a,b,c}
```
This input does not have a space after each comma. As a result, when `k` increments by 3, it will skip letters incorrectly and result in an inaccurate count.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle cases where the input does not strictly follow the expected format (e.g., missing spaces after commas), it may produce incorrect results or even errors.

Correctness: **False**.
