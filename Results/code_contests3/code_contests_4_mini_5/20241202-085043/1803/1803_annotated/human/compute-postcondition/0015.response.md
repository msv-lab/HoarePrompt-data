Functionality: ** The function accepts a string formatted as '{letter1, letter2, ...}' and processes it to collect every third character (starting from the first character after the opening brace) into a list. It then prints the count of unique letters from that list. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, it does not handle malformed input strings or strings that do not follow the expected format. **
