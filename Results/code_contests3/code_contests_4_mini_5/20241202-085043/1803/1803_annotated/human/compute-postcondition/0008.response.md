The value of `k` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `k` is unknown. The state of `Arreglo` and `Cadena` are not directly affected by this operation, but this change will impact future iterations or accesses that depend on the value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is increased by adding `Cadena[k]` for each valid index `k`, and `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is increased by adding `Cadena[k]` for each valid index `k`, and `k` is increased by 3.**
