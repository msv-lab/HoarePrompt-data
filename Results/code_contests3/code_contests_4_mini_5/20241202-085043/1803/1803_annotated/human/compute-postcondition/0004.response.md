The code assigns to `Arreglo` a new list that includes the element of `Cadena` at index `k`. Given that `k` is 1, `Cadena[k]` will retrieve the second element from the string `Cadena`. The initial values are `Arreglo` as an empty list and `k` as 1. The value of `Cadena` will influence what is appended to `Arreglo`. The output state reflects the state of `Arreglo` after the operation.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains small English letters separated by ', '; `Arreglo` contains the second element of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
