According to the code, the ability of the loop to execute again depends on the values of `k` and the length of `Cadena`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than the length of `Cadena` and the length of `Cadena` is greater than 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been increased by 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that after adding 3 to `k`, it is still less than the length of `Cadena`.

Thus, the conditions need to be adjusted as follows:
- The length of `Cadena` must be greater than `k + 3` to guarantee that `k` is still a valid index for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that the length of `Cadena` must be greater than `k + 3`.

State: **`Arreglo` is increased by adding `Cadena[k]` for each valid index `k`, and for the loop to execute again, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k + 3` and `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 2**
