The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The conditions for the execution state indicate that `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k + 3` and `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 2. However, since we don't have the specific value of `k` or the length of `Cadena`, we know that `k` has increased by 3 but the exact implications on `Arreglo` or the conditions cannot be confirmed. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is increased by adding `Cadena[k]`, `k` is increased by 3, and the conditions regarding `Cadena` remain applicable.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is increased by adding `Cadena[k]`, `k` is increased by 3, and the conditions regarding `Cadena` remain applicable.**
