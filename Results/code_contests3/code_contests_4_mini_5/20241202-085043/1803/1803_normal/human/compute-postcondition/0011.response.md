`k` is incremented by 3, changing its previous value from 7 to 10. The other variables, including `Arreglo`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]`, `Cadena[4]`, and `Cadena[7]`; `k` is now 10, and the loop can potentially execute again if `len(Cadena)` is greater than 10.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]`, `Cadena[4]`, and `Cadena[7]`; `k` is now 10; the loop can execute again if `len(Cadena)` is greater than 10.**
