To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. The loop condition checks if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2. 
2. The variable `k` starts at 1 and is incremented by 3 each time the loop executes.
3. The elements added to the `Arreglo` list are specific characters from the `Cadena`, based on the index `k`.

The loop will continue to execute until the value of `k` exceeds the length of `Cadena`. 

Now considering the output state after all iterations:

1. If `Cadena` is structured as a set of letters (not empty), the loop will execute as long as `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k`, with `k` starting at 1 and incrementing by 3 each time.
2. The last valid index added to `Arreglo` will be determined by the maximum value of `k` that satisfies the loop condition before exceeding `len(Cadena)`.

After the loop completes, `Arreglo` will contain elements from `Cadena` at every third index starting from 1, up until the length of `Cadena` allows. 

In the end:
- `Arreglo` will hold all valid characters from the specified indices of `Cadena`.
- `k` will be larger than the length of `Cadena`, causing the loop to terminate.

Thus, the final output state will reflect the values of `Arreglo` and `k`:

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains elements `Cadena[1], Cadena[4], Cadena[7], ...` up to the last valid index before exceeding the length of `Cadena`; `k` is greater than `len(Cadena)` at termination.**
