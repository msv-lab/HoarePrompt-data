Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input that represents a set of small English letters formatted with curly brackets, such as '{a, b, c}', or is an empty set represented by '{}'. It extracts every third character starting from the second character (index 1) of the input string, counts the unique letters from the extracted characters, and prints the count. If the input does not conform to the expected format or is an empty set, the function may not behave as intended, potentially leading to an output of 0 for an empty set.**
