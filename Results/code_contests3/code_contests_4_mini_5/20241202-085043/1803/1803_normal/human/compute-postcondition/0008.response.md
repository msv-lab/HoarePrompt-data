The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Initially, `k` is 4, so after execution, `k` becomes 7. The values of the other variables `Arreglo` and `Cadena` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`; `k` is 7; `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`; `k` is 7; `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4**
