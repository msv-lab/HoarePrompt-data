The function `func` accepts a parameter that is a string representing a set of small English letters. The string must start with an opening curly bracket '{' and end with a closing curly bracket '}', and the letters within the set are separated by a comma and a space. If the string represents an empty set, it is denoted by '{}'. The length of the string does not exceed 1000 characters. 

However, the output of the function is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, I cannot describe the possible return values or cases based on the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string input representing a set of small English letters or an empty set, specifically formatted with curly brackets and possibly containing letters separated by commas and spaces.**
