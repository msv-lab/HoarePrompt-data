The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo`, which is updated by concatenating the existing list `Arreglo` with a new list containing the element `Cadena[k]`. The value of `k` is 4, so the code is appending the element at index 4 of the list `Cadena` to `Arreglo`. 

Since the condition for the loop execution is that `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 4, we can infer that `Cadena` contains at least 5 elements (indexes 0 to 4), allowing access to `Cadena[4]`.

Given that `Arreglo` initially contains the element `Cadena[1]` and assuming `Cadena[4]` is valid, the output state will reflect the updated list `Arreglo`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is a list containing `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`; `k` is 4; `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.**
