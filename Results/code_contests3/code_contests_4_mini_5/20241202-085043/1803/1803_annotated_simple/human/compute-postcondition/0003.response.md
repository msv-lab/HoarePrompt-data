According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `Cadena`. The loop will execute if `len(Cadena)` is greater than `k` (which is currently 1) and also greater than 2. 

Right before the loop, since `Cadena` is a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than 2 for the loop to execute. 

Since `k` is 1, as long as `len(Cadena)` is greater than 2, both conditions will be satisfied. 

Currently, we need to ensure that `len(Cadena)` is indeed greater than 2. 

State: **`Cadena` is a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, for the loop to execute the first time `len(Cadena)` is greater than 2**
