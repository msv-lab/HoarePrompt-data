Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input representing a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, where letters are separated by a comma followed by a space. It processes this string to extract characters at specific intervals (indices 1, 4, 7, etc.) and counts the number of unique characters from this subset. Finally, it prints the count of unique characters. If the input string is empty or consists of just the curly brackets, the function will result in an empty list and print `0`. **
