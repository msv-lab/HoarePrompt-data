Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This would lead to an error if the program is run in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Character Extraction**: The program attempts to extract letters from the string by iterating through the string with a fixed interval (every 3rd character starting from index 1). This approach assumes that every letter will always be located at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., which does not account for the actual positions of the letters based on the input format. For example, if the input is `{a, b, c}`, the letters are at positions 1, 5, and 9, not just the every third position after the first character.

3. **Empty Set Handling**: While the program does handle the case of an empty set `{}` by checking the length of `Cadena`, it does not correctly populate the `Arreglo` list for other cases since it uses the wrong indexing logic.

4. **Output Logic**: The program counts distinct letters using `len(list(set(Arreglo)))`, but since `Arreglo` may not contain all the letters (or could contain incorrect letters based on the wrong extraction logic), the output may not reflect the actual distinct letters in the input.

In conclusion, the method used to collect letters from the input string is incorrect, and thus the program will not always produce the correct count of distinct letters as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
