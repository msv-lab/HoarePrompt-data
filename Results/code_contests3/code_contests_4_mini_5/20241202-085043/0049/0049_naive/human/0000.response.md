Correctness: **False**.

The provided program incorrectly determines when it is possible to reverse a substring to create a lexicographically smaller string. The logic only checks if there exists an index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, which is insufficient. 

For example, consider the string `s = "abcde"`. The program would evaluate this as "NO" because all characters are in non-decreasing order. However, it is possible to reverse a substring like `s[1:3]`, resulting in `s = "bacde"`, which is lexicographically smaller than the original string.

Additionally, there is no check to ensure that the indices `l` and `r` satisfy `1 ≤ l < r ≤ n` in the output. The program simply outputs the first found pair without ensuring the substring can be reversed to create a valid smaller string in all cases. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
