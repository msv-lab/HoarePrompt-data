The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there are any adjacent characters in the string such that the first character is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it prints "YES" and the 1-based indices of the first pair found; otherwise, it prints "NO". If no such adjacent characters are found, the variable `pos` remains uninitialized.
