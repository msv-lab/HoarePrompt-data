According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
