According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2, which means that the loop can execute again since `0 < n - 1` is true when `n` is at least 2. 

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must remain at least 2, as it is already established that `n` is at least 2, allowing for the index `i` to be 1 and `i + 1` to be 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
