The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of array `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` of array `c`; `flag` is True; `pos` is 0.  
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of array `c` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` of array `c`; `flag` is True; `pos` is 0**
