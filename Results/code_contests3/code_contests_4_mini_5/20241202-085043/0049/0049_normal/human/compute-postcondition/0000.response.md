The variable `n` is assigned the value returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The `raw_input()` function takes input from the user, which is then split into individual components (based on spaces) and converted into integers by `map(int, ...)`. Since `n` is initially an integer in the range 2 to 300000, the new value of `n` will depend on the input. The string `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**
