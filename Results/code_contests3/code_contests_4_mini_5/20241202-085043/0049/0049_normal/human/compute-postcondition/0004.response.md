According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2`, which means `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is `1` or `0`, the loop will not execute. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is the first element of the input list of integers, and we need to ensure that `n` is at least `2`. The variable `i` should be initialized to `0`, which is the starting index of the for loop.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time.**
