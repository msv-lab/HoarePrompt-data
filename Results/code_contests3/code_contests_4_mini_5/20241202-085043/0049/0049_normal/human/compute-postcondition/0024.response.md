The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, it is implied that the function operates on two inputs: `n`, which is an integer with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000, and `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. 

Since the output behavior is not provided, we cannot ascertain the return values or any specific cases that may arise from the inputs. Therefore, based on the constraints and relationships provided, we summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
