Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that reversing substrings can also lead to lexicographically smaller strings in cases where the characters are not adjacent. The current implementation only checks for pairs of adjacent characters where the first character is greater than the second (i.e., `c[i] > c[i + 1]`). 

Consider the following case:

Input:
```
5
abcde
```

In this case, there's no adjacent pair where the first character is greater than the second, so the program would output "NO". However, if we were to reverse the substring from index 1 to 5 (which would be the entire string), we would get "edcba", which is indeed lexicographically smaller than "abcde". 

Thus, the program fails to consider the possibility of reversing longer substrings that could result in a smaller string. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.
