To evaluate the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, let's break down both and identify any discrepancies.

### Problem Description Breakdown:
1. **Input Requirements**:
   - An integer `n` (length of string) and a string `s` of length `n` made of lowercase Latin letters.
   
2. **Output Requirements**:
   - If it is impossible to reverse any substring to create a lexicographically smaller string, print "NO".
   - If it is possible, print "YES" followed by the indices `l` and `r` (1-based) of a substring that can be reversed.

3. **Lexicographic Comparison**:
   - A string `x` is lexicographically less than `y` if either `x` is a prefix of `y` or there exists an index `i` such that `x[i] < y[i]` while all previous characters are equal.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the length `n` and the string `c` correctly.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the string `c` to find if there exists any position `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. 
   - If such a position exists, it sets a flag and records the position `pos`.

3. **Output Decision**:
   - If the flag is `True`, it prints "YES" and the indices `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. 
   - If the flag is `False`, it prints "NO".

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- The program effectively identifies a position in the string where a character is greater than the next character. This is key because reversing the substring that begins at that character and ends at the next character will create a new string that is lexicographically smaller.
- For example, if the substring is `c[pos]` and `c[pos + 1]`, reversing it will change their order, potentially lowering the overall string value if `c[pos] > c[pos + 1]`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program only considers pairs of characters (`c[i]` and `c[i + 1]`). This is a valid approach because reversing just those two characters will lead to a lexicographically smaller string if the first character is greater than the second.
- It does not explore longer substrings, but the problem requirement is satisfied since any valid substring that can be reversed to create a smaller string is acceptable.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It checks the necessary conditions and provides the correct output based on the findings. There are no cases where it would fail to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
