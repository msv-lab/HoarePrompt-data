The variable `n` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `n`, which means `n` will now hold that specific integer value from the list. The string `s` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now the first element of the input list, and `s` is a string of length n.

Output State: **`n` is now the first element of the input list, `s` is a string of length n**
