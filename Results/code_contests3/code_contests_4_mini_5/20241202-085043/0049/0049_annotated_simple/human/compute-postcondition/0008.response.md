Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of the input list greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is a string input from the user, and `flag` is set to True if the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`; `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains False and `pos` is not assigned.***
