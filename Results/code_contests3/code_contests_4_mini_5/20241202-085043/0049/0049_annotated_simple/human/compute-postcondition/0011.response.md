`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the input list greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is the string input from the user, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is 1.
