Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one character in the string that is greater than the next character in the sequence. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the two characters involved (1-based indexing). If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. **
