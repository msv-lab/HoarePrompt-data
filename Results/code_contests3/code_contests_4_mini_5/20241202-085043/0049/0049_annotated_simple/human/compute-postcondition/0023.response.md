Postcondition: ***`n` is the first element of the input list greater than 1; `i` is `n - 2`; `s` is a string of length `n`; `c` is the string input from the user. If `flag` is True, `pos` is assigned the index of the last character found to be greater than the next character, 'YES' is printed along with `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. Otherwise, if `flag` is False, `pos` remains undefined and 'NO' is printed.***
