The value of `n` is reassigned to the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which will read a line of input, split it into components, and convert those components into integers. Since `n` is originally an integer satisfying `2 ≤ n ≤ 300000`, the new value of `n` will depend on the input provided. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now a list of integers from the input, and `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`n` is now a list of integers from the input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
