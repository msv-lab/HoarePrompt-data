The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 300000 \), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the content of the string `s`. However, the specific output behavior or conditions for returning values are not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s`, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string s of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
