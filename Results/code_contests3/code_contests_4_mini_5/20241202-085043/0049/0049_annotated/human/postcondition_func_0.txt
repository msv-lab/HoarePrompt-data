The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks for any occurrence in the string where a character is greater than the next character. If such an occurrence exists, it prints 'YES' and the 1-based indices of the two characters involved; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If there are no characters greater than the following character, it indicates that the string is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not return a value but directly outputs the result.
