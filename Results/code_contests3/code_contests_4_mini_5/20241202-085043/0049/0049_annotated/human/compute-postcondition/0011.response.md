`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1**
