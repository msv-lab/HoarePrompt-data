The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function's output is not specified in the prompt. 

Given the constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, but the specific output of the function is not detailed.**
