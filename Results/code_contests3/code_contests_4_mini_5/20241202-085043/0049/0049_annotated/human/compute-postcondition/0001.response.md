The variable `n` is reassigned to the first element of the list that is created by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which converts the input into a sequence of integers. Since `n` was initially an integer representing a sequence (or list) of integers, after this line, `n` will take the value of the first integer from that input list. The state of other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, now assigned to the first element of the input list**
