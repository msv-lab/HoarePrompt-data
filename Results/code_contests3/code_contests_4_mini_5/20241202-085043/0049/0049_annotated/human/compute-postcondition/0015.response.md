`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The value of `i` is unaffected by this assignment. The values of `n`, `c`, and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and `pos` is 2. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2**
