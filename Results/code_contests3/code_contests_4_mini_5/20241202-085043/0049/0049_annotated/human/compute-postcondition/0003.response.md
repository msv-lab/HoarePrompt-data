The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `c` is an input string, and `flag` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `c` is an input string, `flag` is False**
