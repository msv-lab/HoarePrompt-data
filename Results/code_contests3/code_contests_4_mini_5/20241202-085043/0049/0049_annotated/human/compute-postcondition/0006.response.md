The value of `flag` is assigned `True`. The previous value of `flag` was `False`, so now `flag` changes from `False` to `True`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c.**
