In the given code snippet, `print(pos + 1, pos + 2)` executes a print statement that outputs two values. The value of `pos` is used to calculate the two outputs:

1. The first value is `pos + 1`.
2. The second value is `pos + 2`.

Since `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of a character in the string `c` that is greater than the following character, it has a specific integer value. However, its exact value is not specified in the initial state.

The variables `n`, `c`, and `flag` are not affected by this print statement, and the output specifically depends on the value of `pos`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and 'YES' is printed; the values printed are `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and 'YES' is printed; the values printed are `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.**
