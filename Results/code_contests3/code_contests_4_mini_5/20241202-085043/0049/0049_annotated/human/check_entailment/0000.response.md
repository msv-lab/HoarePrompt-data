Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n`, which represents the length of the string, and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Lexicographical Condition**: The core requirement is to find a substring such that reversing it results in a string that is lexicographically less than the original string. The program achieves this by iterating through the string and checking if any character is greater than the following character (i.e., `c[i] > c[i + 1]`). This condition indicates that a reversal of the substring starting at `i` and ending at `i + 1` would yield a lexicographically smaller string.

3. **Output**: If such a condition is found (i.e., `flag` is set to `True`), the program outputs "YES" along with the 1-based indices of the characters involved in the potential reversal (`pos + 1` and `pos + 2`). If no such condition is found, it outputs "NO".

4. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic ensures that if there exists any pair of characters where the first is greater than the second, a valid substring exists that, when reversed, results in a string that is lexicographically less than the original. The program does not need to find the minimum possible string but only needs to confirm that such a reversal is possible.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles cases where the string is sorted in non-decreasing order by correctly identifying that no characters meet the reversal condition, thus outputting "NO".

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly implements the necessary checks to determine if a substring can be reversed to achieve a lexicographically smaller string.
