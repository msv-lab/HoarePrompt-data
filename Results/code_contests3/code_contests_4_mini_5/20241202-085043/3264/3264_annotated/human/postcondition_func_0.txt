The function accepts a positive integer `n` via user input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even and greater than 2, it prints two values: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. The function does not return any values, and there is a potential issue with how the output is formatted due to the lack of parentheses in the print statements.
