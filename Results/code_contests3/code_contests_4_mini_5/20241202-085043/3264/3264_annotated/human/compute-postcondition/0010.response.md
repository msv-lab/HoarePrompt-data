The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints given, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since no specific output or behavior is provided in the output section, we cannot describe the return values or the functionality of the function accurately. 

In summary, the function does not accept any parameters and the return value is unspecified. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and the return value is unspecified.**
