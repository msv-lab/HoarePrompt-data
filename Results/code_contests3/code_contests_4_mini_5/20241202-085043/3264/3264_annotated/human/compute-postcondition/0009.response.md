Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` ≤ 2, a syntax error occurs and no output is produced. If `n` > 2 and is odd, the outputs are (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` > 2 and is even, the outputs are `k^2 - 1` and `k^2 + 1`, where `k` is half of `n`.***
