The expression `print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1` will evaluate the two separate expressions. The first expression calculates `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression calculates `n * n / 4 + 1`.

Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can denote `n` as `2k` for some integer `k` where `k â‰¥ 2` (for example, if `n` is 4, then `k` is 2; if `n` is 8, then `k` is 4). 

1. For the first expression:
   - `n * n / 4` simplifies to `(2k) * (2k) / 4 = 4k^2 / 4 = k^2`.
   - Therefore, `n * n / 4 - 1` becomes `k^2 - 1`.

2. For the second expression:
   - Again we have `n * n / 4` which is `k^2`.
   - Thus, `n * n / 4 + 1` becomes `k^2 + 1`.

Hence, the output state after evaluating these expressions depends on the specific value of `n` but generally can be expressed as:
- The first output will be `k^2 - 1`.
- The second output will be `k^2 + 1`.

Given that `k` can take values starting from 2, we can express it generally. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer greater than 2; first output is `k^2 - 1`, second output is `k^2 + 1`.**
