The code attempts to execute a print statement, but it is incorrectly formatted as `print - 1`, which will result in a syntax error. Therefore, no values are printed, and the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2; syntax error occurs, no output is produced.**
