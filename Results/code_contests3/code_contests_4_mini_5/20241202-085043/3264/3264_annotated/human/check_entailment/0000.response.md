Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling of n = 1 and n = 2**:
   - The program correctly prints `-1` for `n = 1` and `n = 2`, which is consistent with the problem description since no Pythagorean triples exist for these values. However, it does not account for the output format specified in the problem description; it should have returned `-1` directly without additional checks.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The program uses `print` statements without parentheses for Python 2 style output. If this code were executed in Python 3, it would raise a `SyntaxError`. This issue is critical because the output format must adhere to the requirements of the problem description.

3. **Calculation of Pythagorean Triples**:
   - For odd integers `n > 2`, the output `(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2` correctly generates a Pythagorean triple. For example, for `n = 3`, it calculates `(3 * 3 - 1) / 2 = 4` and `(3 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 5`, which is correct.
   - For even integers `n > 2`, the output `n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1` also generates valid Pythagorean triples. For example, for `n = 6`, it outputs `8` and `10`, which are correct.

4. **Potential Division by Zero**:
   - There are also concerns about integer division; the program uses `/` for division, which can lead to float results in Python 3. This could cause a problem when trying to ensure that the output values are integers.

### Conclusion:
While the program handles some cases correctly, it fails to cover all potential scenarios fully and has significant issues with output format and compatibility with Python versions. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description's requirements.
