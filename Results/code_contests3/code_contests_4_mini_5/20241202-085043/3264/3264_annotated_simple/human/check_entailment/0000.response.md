To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program's logic and its alignment with the requirements of the problem.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input:** A single integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ \( 10^9 \)).
2. **Output:** If \( n \) can be a side of a Pythagorean triple, output two integers \( m \) and \( k \) such that \( n, m, k \) form a Pythagorean triple. If \( n \) cannot be a part of any Pythagorean triple, output -1.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program starts by reading an integer \( n \).
- It checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2:
  - If true, it prints -1. This is correct since there are no Pythagorean triples where all sides are less than or equal to 2.
  
- If \( n \) is greater than 2:
  - It checks if \( n \) is odd:
    - For odd \( n \), it computes:
      - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
      - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
    - These values are derived from the property of Pythagorean triples where if \( n \) is odd, \( m \) and \( k \) are guaranteed to form a valid Pythagorean triple with \( n \) as the smaller leg (cathetus).
  
  - If \( n \) is even:
    - It computes:
      - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
      - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
    - This is also a valid formulation since for even \( n \), it can be shown that these values will form a valid Pythagorean triple.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies when \( n \) can form a Pythagorean triple (for \( n > 2 \)) and provides corresponding values \( m \) and \( k \). The conditions for outputting -1 are also correctly implemented.

### Final Verdict:
The program adheres to the problem description and handles all specified cases accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
