The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since the output is not specified, we can't provide details about return values or cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
