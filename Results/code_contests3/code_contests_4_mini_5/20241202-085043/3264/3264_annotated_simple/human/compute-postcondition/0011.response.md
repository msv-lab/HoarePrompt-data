Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints two values: `n^2 - 1` and `n^2 + 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results directly. **
