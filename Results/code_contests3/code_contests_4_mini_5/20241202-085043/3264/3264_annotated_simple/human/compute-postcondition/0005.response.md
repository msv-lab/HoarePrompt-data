The code performs calculations based on the value of `n`, which is an input integer greater than 2 and odd. The first part of the code calculates `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second part calculates `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

1. Since `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, we can determine that `n * n` will also be odd, making `n * n - 1` even and `n * n + 1` even.
2. Therefore, `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2` will yield integer results.

The output will consist of two values: the first being the result of `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second being the result of `(n * n + 1) / 2`.

Since `n` is not specified, we can represent the results in terms of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 2, and `n` is an odd integer; output is ((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)**
