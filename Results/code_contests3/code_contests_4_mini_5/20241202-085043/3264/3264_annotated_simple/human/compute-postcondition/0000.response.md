The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, but the specific value of `n` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now assigned an input integer. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
