The code snippet evaluates two expressions involving `n`. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second is `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is an input integer greater than 2 and even, we can express `n` as `2k` where `k` is an integer greater than 1.

Calculating the first expression:
1. `n * n = (2k) * (2k) = 4k^2`
2. `4k^2 / 4 = k^2`
3. Therefore, `k^2 - 1` is the result of the first expression.

Calculating the second expression:
1. We already have `4k^2 / 4 = k^2`
2. Therefore, `k^2 + 1` is the result of the second expression.

The output of the print statement will display the results of both expressions, which are `k^2 - 1` and `k^2 + 1`.

Thus, the output state after the execution is:
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2 and even; printed values are `k^2 - 1` and `k^2 + 1`.**
