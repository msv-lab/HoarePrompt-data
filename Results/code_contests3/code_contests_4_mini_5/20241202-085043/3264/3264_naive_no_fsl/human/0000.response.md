To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
We need to find a Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) such that one of the sides (cathetus or hypotenuse) is equal to the given integer `n`. The program must handle cases where:
1. `n` is less than or equal to 2.
2. `n` is odd.
3. `n` is even.

### Program Logic:
1. If `n <= 2`, the program outputs `-1` since there are no Pythagorean triples possible with integer values less than or equal to 2.
2. If `n` is odd, it calculates:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
3. If `n` is even, it calculates:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)

### Potential Issues:
1. The program uses integer division for `n` being odd, but does not explicitly handle the cases for large values of `n` (up to \( 10^9 \)). The calculated values of `m` and `k` could exceed the limits specified for the output (up to \( 10^{18} \)).
2. The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should be replaced with `input()` for compatibility.
3. The program does not handle the case where `n` is 2 correctly. It outputs `-1`, which is correct, but it doesnâ€™t provide a valid output for any other cases where `n` is less than 3.
4. The formula used for calculating `m` and `k` when `n` is even should ensure that \( m \) and \( k \) values are valid integers and within the specified range.

### Test Cases:
- For `n = 2`, the expected output is `-1`, which the program handles correctly. 
- For `n = 3`, it should output `(4, 5)`, which it does correctly.
- For `n = 4`, it should output `(3, 5)`, which is not handled in the code as it does not account for `n` as a cathetus when `n` is even.
- For `n = 6`, it outputs `(8, 10)` which is correct.
- For `n = 1`, it outputs `-1`, which is also correct.
- For `n = 17`, it outputs `(144, 145)`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to find Pythagorean triples when `n` is an even number greater than 2 but less than 4. For example, `n = 4` should yield `(3, 5)`, but the program does not compute that. Hence, it does not cover all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
