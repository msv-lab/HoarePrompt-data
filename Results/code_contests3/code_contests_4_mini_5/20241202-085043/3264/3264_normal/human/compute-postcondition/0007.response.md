The code snippet calculates two expressions: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Given that `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can compute the results of these expressions.

1. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1`.
2. The second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`.

Since `n` is even, `n * n` will also be even, and dividing an even number by 4 will yield an integer result when `n` is a multiple of 2.

Let’s denote `k = n * n / 4`. Therefore:
- The first expression results in `k - 1`.
- The second expression results in `k + 1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, the output state will indicate the relationship based on the variable `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, and `n` is an even integer; the results of the expressions are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
