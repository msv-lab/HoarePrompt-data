The code snippet calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. Given that `n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2, we can derive the outputs of these expressions.

1. The first expression calculates `n * n - 1`, which is an even number because the square of an odd number is odd, and subtracting 1 results in an even number. Dividing this even number by 2 will yield an integer value.
  
2. The second expression calculates `n * n + 1`, which is also an even number, since the square of an odd number is odd and adding 1 results in an even number. Dividing this by 2 will also yield an integer value.

Since `n` is an odd integer and larger than 2, we can conclude the following:

- Let’s denote `n` as a specific odd integer (for example, 3, 5, 7, ... up to 10^9). The exact numerical output will depend on the chosen `n`, but the formulas remain valid regardless of the specific value of `n`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the two calculated values from the expressions are integers derived from the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, and `n` is an odd number; the expressions evaluate to two integers based on `n`: (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2.**
