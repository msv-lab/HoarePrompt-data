Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` from input, which must be between 1 and 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1. If `n` is odd, it calculates and prints the values `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even, it calculates and prints `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. Thus, the function handles different cases based on the parity of `n` and outputs specific values accordingly.**
