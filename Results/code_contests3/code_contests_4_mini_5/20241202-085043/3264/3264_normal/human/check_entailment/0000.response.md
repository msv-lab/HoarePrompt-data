To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the program and the description:

### Problem Description:
The task is to find a Pythagorean triple (n, m, k) for a given positive integer n, which can be a cathetus or the hypotenuse. The output should consist of integers m and k such that n, m, and k form a valid Pythagorean triple. If no such triple exists, the output should be -1.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

1. **Handling n <= 2**: The program correctly returns -1 for n = 1 or n = 2, as there are no valid Pythagorean triples with these values.
  
2. **Handling Odd n**: For odd n, it computes:
   - m = (n * n - 1) / 2
   - k = (n * n + 1) / 2
   These values form a valid Pythagorean triple since:
   - n^2 + m^2 = k^2 can be verified by checking the Pythagorean theorem.
  
3. **Handling Even n**: For even n, it computes:
   - m = n * n / 4 - 1
   - k = n * n / 4 + 1
   Similar to the odd case, these values also form a valid Pythagorean triple.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The hints indicate that the program handles different cases based on the parity of n and outputs specific values accordingly. 
- The hints confirm the program's logic for odd and even n, and also state the cases where the output is -1.

### Edge Cases:
- For inputs like n = 1, 2: The program correctly outputs -1.
- For larger odd and even values of n: The derived values for m and k will always be valid as they adhere to the Pythagorean theorem.

### Conclusion:
All cases from the problem description are handled correctly, and the output hints align with the logic of the program. No edge cases are overlooked, and the program produces valid outputs for all specified inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
