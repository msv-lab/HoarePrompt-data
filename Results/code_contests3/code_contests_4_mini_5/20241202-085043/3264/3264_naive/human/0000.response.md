To analyze the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and examine the code.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. We need to find a Pythagorean triple (n, m, k) such that n is one of the sides (either a cathetus or the hypotenuse).
2. If no such triple exists for a given n, the program must return -1.
3. The output must satisfy the constraints: (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18).

**Program Analysis:**
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

### Code Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The program reads an integer `n`.
   
2. **Condition for n <= 2:**
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it correctly returns -1 since there are no Pythagorean triples involving sides of length 1 or 2.

3. **Odd n (n & 1):**
   - For odd values of `n`, the program calculates:
     - `m = (n * n - 1) / 2`
     - `k = (n * n + 1) / 2`
   - These calculations derive from the property that for odd integers, there exists a Pythagorean triple that can be constructed.

4. **Even n:**
   - For even values of `n`, it calculates:
     - `m = (n * n / 4 - 1)`
     - `k = (n * n / 4 + 1)`
   - This is also a valid way to find corresponding integers that form a Pythagorean triple with an even `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The issue arises in how the program calculates and prints the results. The outputs are calculated but not printed correctly in the `elif` and `else` blocks. The correct format should have used `print()` function in Python 2 or simply `print` in Python 3. However, the program is written as if it were intended for Python 2, but using parentheses incorrectly.

- Even more critically, the division operator `/` in Python 2 performs integer division when both operands are integers, which means the results might not be accurate if `n * n - 1` is odd. This could lead to incorrect results for odd `n`.

### Example of Failure:
Consider `n = 3`. The expected output for the Pythagorean triple is:
- `m = (3 * 3 - 1) / 2 = 4`
- `k = (3 * 3 + 1) / 2 = 5`

The program outputs:
```
(4, 5)
```
This is correct.

Now consider `n = 2`. The program outputs -1 correctly.

However, if we test with `n = 6`, we would expect to get integers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. The calculation should yield:
- `m = (6 * 6 / 4 - 1) = 8`
- `k = (6 * 6 / 4 + 1) = 10`

The program would output `(8, 10)`, which is also correct.

However, it fails to handle the case where it might be run in a different Python environment or with edge cases due to the incorrect print format and potential type issues.

### Conclusion:
The program has a clear flaw in its output format and may lead to incorrect results if not functioning in a specific environment. Thus, it does not adhere strictly to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
