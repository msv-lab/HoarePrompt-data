The value of `s` is assigned to 0. This means that regardless of the previous value of `s`, it is now reset to 0. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 0 or `s`, `l` is a list of words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 0 or `s`, `l` is a list of words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is now 0.**
