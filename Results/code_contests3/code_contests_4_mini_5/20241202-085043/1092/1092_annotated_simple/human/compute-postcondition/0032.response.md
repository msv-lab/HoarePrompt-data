The value of `s` is assigned the value `0`, which directly overwrites any previous value of `s`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `s` is now 0.
