The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is initially 0, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 0 or `s`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list (which is not empty), `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
