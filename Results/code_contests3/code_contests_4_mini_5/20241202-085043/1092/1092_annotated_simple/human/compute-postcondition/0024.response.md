The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` could either be 0 or `s`, but since we are only modifying `s`, the output state will reflect the change in `s`. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 0 or `s`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `j` is the next character in `i`, and `s` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 0 or `s`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `j` is the next character in `i`, and `s` is incremented by 1.**
