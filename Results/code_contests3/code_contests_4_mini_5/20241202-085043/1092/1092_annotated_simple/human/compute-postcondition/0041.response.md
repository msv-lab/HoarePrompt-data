The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is unknown, but since it can be any non-negative integer, the output state reflects that `s` has increased by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `j` is the next character in `i`, and `s` is increased by 1.
