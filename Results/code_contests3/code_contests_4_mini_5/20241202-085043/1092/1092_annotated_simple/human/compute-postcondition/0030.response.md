The value of `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` (the total number of uppercase letters in `i`) and the previous value of `m` (which is either 0 or the count of uppercase letters in `i`). Since `m` is being set to the maximum of these two values, it will be either the count of uppercase letters in `i` (which is `s`) or the previous value of `m`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`.**
