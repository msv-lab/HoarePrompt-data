According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If `l` has at least 3 words, the loop can execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, and `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to the third word in the list, and `l` must have at least 3 words.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, and `s` is the total number of uppercase letters in `i`.**
