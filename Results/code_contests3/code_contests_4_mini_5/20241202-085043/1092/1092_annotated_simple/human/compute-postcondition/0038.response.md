The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1 (if `j` is an uppercase character). Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is now 2, and `j` is the next character in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `s` is now 2, and `j` is the next character in `i`.**
