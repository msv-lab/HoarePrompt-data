`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of words based on spaces. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer between 1 and 200. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `l` as a list of words derived from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of words from the input string**
