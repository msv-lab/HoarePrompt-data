Functionality: ** The function reads a list of words from input, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and returns the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any single word. It does not explicitly utilize the parameter `n`, which is mentioned in the annotations, and it does not handle cases where the input string could be empty or contain only whitespace.**
