The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If `s` was initially 2, it will now be 3; if `s` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `j` is the second character of `i`, and `s` is now either 2 or 3.
