The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and since `s` was previously 0, after execution `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list (a non-empty string), `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase character.
