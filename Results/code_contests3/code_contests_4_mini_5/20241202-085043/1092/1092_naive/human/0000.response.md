Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly compute the volume of the text according to the problem description. Specifically, it has an error in the way it calculates the maximum number of capital letters in the words. 

In the provided code, the variable `m` is updated incorrectly. The maximum volume should be determined for each word, but the code compares `s` (the volume of the current word) against `m` (the maximum volume found so far) using `max(s, m)`. However, the assignment `m = max(s, m)` should occur after the inner loop has finished processing each word, ensuring that it only checks the maximum once per word.

For example, consider the input:
```
25
Hello World Test
```
The expected output should be `2` (from "Hello" or "World"), but the code will incorrectly compute the maximum, as it does not properly track the volume of each word after processing all characters. 

Thus, the program fails for cases where there are multiple words with varying volumes, leading to incorrect outputs.
