Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not a valid function in Python 3. The correct function should be `input()`. This means the program may not run correctly in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Length of Input**: Although the problem states that the first line contains an integer `n` which indicates the length of the text, the program does not utilize this integer in any meaningful way. The program simply reads the second line of input without validating its length against `n`. This could lead to cases where the actual input does not adhere to the stated length, which is a violation of the problem constraints.

3. **Output Specification**: The problem description specifies that the output should be a single integer representing the maximum volume of the text. The program correctly implements this but does not address the case where the input might not conform to the expected format (for instance, if there are no words at all or if words are not separated by single spaces).

4. **Case Handling**: The program correctly counts uppercase letters and determines the maximum count across words. However, since it doesn't handle potential edge cases (like invalid input or unexpected formatting), it doesn't fully comply with the robustness expected from a solution.

In conclusion, while the core logic of counting uppercase letters and finding the maximum works, the handling of input and adherence to the problem constraints are insufficient, leading to a determination of incorrectness.
