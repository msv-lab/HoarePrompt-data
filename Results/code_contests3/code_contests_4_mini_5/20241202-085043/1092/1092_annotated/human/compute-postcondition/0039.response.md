Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `s` is 1 if the first character `j` of `i` is uppercase, otherwise `s` remains 0. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is set to either 1 or 2, reflecting the condition of `j`.***
