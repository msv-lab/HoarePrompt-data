The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` was either 0 or 1, depending on whether the first character of `i` was uppercase. Since `s` is being increased by 1, it will now be either 1 or 2. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `s` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `s` is either 1 or 2.**
