To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the provided loop code and the initial state of the variables.

Given that:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200.
- `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word.
- `m` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is the first word in the list `l`.
- `s` is initialized to 0.

The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string `i`. For each character, if it is uppercase, `s` is incremented by 1. 

Let's break this down:
- The final value of `s` will be equal to the count of uppercase characters present in the first word `i` of the list `l`.
- If there are no uppercase characters in `i`, then `s` will remain 0.
- The values of `n`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`.**
