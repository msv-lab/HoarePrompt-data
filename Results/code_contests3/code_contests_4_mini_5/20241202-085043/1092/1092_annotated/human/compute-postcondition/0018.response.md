The value of `s` is assigned to 0, explicitly resetting its value. However, the previous value of `s` which is the count of uppercase characters in `i` is not affected, as it is being set directly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 0**
