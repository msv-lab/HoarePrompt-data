Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words; `m` is max(s, m); `i` is the second word in list `l`; if `j` (the third character of `i`) is uppercase, then `s` is updated to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have at least 3 characters.***
