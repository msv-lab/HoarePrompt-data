The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase character from the string `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase character from the string `i`.**
