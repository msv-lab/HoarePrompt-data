The value of `m` is assigned the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`. The variable `s` represents the total count of uppercase characters in `i`, and `m` holds its previous maximum value. The value of `m` will thus be updated to either retain its previous value or become the value of `s`, depending on which is greater. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase characters in `i`, `j` is the last character of `i`, and `m` is updated to max(s, m).
