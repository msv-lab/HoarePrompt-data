According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`, which is the first word in the list `l`. The loop iterates over each character in `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is the current character in that word.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have more characters left to iterate over. Since `s` is determined based on whether `j` is uppercase, it will either be 2 or 1, depending on the character being processed.

Assuming that the first word `i` has more characters to iterate over, and `j` is currently the last character of that word, the next state should reflect that we are now processing the next character in the word.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `j` is the next character in `i`, and `s` is 2 if `j` is an uppercase character; otherwise, `s` is 1 if `j` is not uppercase.**
