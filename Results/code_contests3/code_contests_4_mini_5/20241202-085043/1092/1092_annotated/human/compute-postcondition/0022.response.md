Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and if `j` is an uppercase character, then `s` is set to 1. If `j` is not uppercase, the value of `s` remains unchanged at 0.***
