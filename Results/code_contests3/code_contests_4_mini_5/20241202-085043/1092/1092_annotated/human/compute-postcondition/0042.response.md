Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `s` is either 1 or 2. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is updated to 2 or 3 based on the condition, and `j` must point to the next character in `i` for the loop to execute a second time.***
