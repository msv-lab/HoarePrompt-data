The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` can be either 1 or 2. Therefore, the new value of `s` will be either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, `s` is either 2 or 3, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must point to the next character in `i`.
