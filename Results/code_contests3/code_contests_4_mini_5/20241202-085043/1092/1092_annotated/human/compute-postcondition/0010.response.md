`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether `j` is an uppercase character from the second character in string `i`. Therefore, after execution, the value of `s` can be either 2 or 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `m` is 0, `i` is the first word in list `l`, `s` is either 2 or 1 depending on the value of `j`.**
