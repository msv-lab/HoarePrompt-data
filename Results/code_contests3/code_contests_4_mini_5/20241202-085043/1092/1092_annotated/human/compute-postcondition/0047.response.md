The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and the input text consists of a single line of words separated by single spaces, containing only small and capital Latin letters. The function's output is not specified in the provided details. Therefore, we cannot ascertain the specific return value or functionality based on the available information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but it operates under the constraints that n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and processes input text consisting of a single line of words with Latin letters. The specific return value is not provided.**
