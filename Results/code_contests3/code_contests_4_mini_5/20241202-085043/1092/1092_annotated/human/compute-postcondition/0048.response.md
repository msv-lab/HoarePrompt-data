Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but processes a line of input that contains words consisting of Latin letters. It counts the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any single word of the input and prints this maximum count. There is no explicit return value, and the function assumes the input will always conform to the expected format, without handling any potential input errors or variations. **
