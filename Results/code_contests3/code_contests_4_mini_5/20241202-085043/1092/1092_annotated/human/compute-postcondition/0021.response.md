The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.
