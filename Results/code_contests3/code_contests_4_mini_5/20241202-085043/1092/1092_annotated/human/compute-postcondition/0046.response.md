The code `print(m)` outputs the value of `m`. The initial state specifies that `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word in `l`. Since no changes are made to `m`, it retains its previous value. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `m`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any word in `l`, and the value of `m` is printed.**
