The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `m`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 2, `j` is the second character of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 2, `j` is the second character of `i`.**
