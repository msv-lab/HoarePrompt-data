According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, and `j` is the first character of that word. The loop can execute again if there are more characters in `i` after `j`.

Since `j` is the first character of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must contain at least 2 characters. The next character will be the second character in `i`. Therefore, we need to update the state to reflect that `j` will be the next character in the string `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `m` is max(s, m), `i` is the second word in list `l`, `s` is 1, `j` is the second character of `i`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must have at least 2 characters.**
