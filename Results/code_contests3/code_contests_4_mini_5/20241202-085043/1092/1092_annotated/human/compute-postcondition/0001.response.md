`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string, splits it into a list of words based on spaces, and assigns this list to `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of words from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of words from the input string.**
