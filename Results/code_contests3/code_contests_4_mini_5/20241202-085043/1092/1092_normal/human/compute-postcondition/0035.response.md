The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and since `s` was previously 0, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive; `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string; `s` is 1; `j` is the first character of `i`; `j` is an uppercase letter.
