`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is affected, but the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list which is a non-empty string, `j` is the second character in `i`, and `s` is incremented by 1.
