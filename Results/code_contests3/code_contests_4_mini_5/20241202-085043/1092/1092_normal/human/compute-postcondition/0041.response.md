The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and since the previous value of `s` is unknown but it must be at least 0 for the increment to be valid, the new value of `s` is now `s + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string, and `s` is incremented by 1.
