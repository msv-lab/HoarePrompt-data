The value of `m` is assigned the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`. The variable `s` represents the count of uppercase letters in the string `i`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will summarize the impact of the calculation on `m` in relation to `s` and its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive; `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
