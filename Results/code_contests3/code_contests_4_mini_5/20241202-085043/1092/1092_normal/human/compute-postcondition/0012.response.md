According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list, which is a non-empty string. The variable `m` is 0, and `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must have more characters to iterate over. Since `j` is the character being iterated over, after the last iteration, `j` will be the next character in the string `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least one more character after the last character processed.

If we denote the length of `i` as `len(i)`, and since `j` is iterating through each character, after the last iteration, the index for the next character would be the length of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list which is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next character in the string `i` and the length of `i` must be greater than the index of the last character processed.**
