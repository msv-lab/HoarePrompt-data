The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string, `s` is 1, and `j` is the second character of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `j` is the second character of `i`.**
