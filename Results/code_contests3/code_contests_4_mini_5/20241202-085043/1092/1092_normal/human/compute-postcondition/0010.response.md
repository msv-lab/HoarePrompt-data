The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `s` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `j` is an uppercase string. Therefore, after execution, `s` will be either 1 or 2. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j` are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list which is a non-empty string, and `s` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list which is a non-empty string, and `s` is either 1 or 2.**
