According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the characters of the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second word in the list, which is a non-empty string. 

If `i` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute again for each character in `i`. Since `i` is non-empty, there are characters to iterate over. The variable `j` takes on the value of each character in `i` sequentially. If `j` is the first character of `i` in the first iteration, the next iteration will have `j` as the second character of `i`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
- If `i` has at least 2 characters, after the current iteration, `j` will be the second character on the next iteration.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least 2 characters.

Thus, after the current iteration, we increment the index of the character `j` to the next character in the string `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list which is a non-empty string, and for the loop to execute once more `i` must have at least 3 characters, `j` is the second character in `i`.**
