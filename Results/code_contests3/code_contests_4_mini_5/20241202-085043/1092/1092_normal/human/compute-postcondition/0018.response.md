The variable `s` is assigned the value of `0`. The state of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list which is a non-empty string, `s` is 0.
