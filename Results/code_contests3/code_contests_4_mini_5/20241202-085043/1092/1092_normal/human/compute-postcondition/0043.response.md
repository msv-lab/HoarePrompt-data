To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided initial state and the loop code.

The loop iterates over each character `j` in the string `i`. For each character, if it is uppercase, the variable `s` is incremented. The variable `s` starts at 0 and counts the number of uppercase letters in the string `i`.

After executing the loop for all characters in `i`:
- If `i` contains `k` uppercase letters, then `s` will equal `k`.
- If `i` contains no uppercase letters, `s` will remain 0.

The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, and `i` do not change throughout the execution of the loop.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive; `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string; `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
