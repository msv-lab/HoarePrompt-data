According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `i`. The loop iterates over each character in `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third word in the list, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must have more characters left to iterate over.

Since `j` takes on the value of each character in `i`, and assuming `i` has at least 4 characters, after the first iteration, `j` will be the second character of `i` for the second iteration. If `i` has less than 4 characters, the loop cannot execute a second time. 

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `i` will move to the next character in the string.
- The value of `s` remains the same unless an uppercase letter is encountered.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive; `m` is the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list and a non-empty string; `s` is now 0; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must have at least 4 characters, and `j` is the second character of `i`.**
