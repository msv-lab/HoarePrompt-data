According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate over the characters in the string `i`, which is the first word in the list `l`. Since `l` contains at least one word, `i` will be a string that consists of the characters of that word. The loop will execute based on the characters in `i`.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm the following:
1. The variable `i` should be the first word in the list `l`, which is guaranteed since `l` has at least one word.
2. The loop variable `j` will take on each character of the string `i` during the iterations.

As `m` is set to 0 and `s` is also 0 before the loop starts, they do not influence the execution of the loop itself. Therefore, the key states that need to be acknowledged for the loop to execute are related to `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute `i` must be a non-empty string (the first word in the list)**
