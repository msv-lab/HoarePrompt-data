The function `func` does not have any parameters, as defined by its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\), and `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). The output of the function has not been provided, so we cannot determine the specific return value or the cases under which it returns different outputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n and m are integers within the range [1, 10^12] and a and b are integers within the range [1, 100]. The specific return value is not defined.**
