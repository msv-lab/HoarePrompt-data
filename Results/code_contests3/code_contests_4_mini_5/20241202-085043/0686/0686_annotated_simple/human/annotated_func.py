#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` and `m` are in the range [1, 10^12] and `a` and `b` are in the range [1, 100]. However, the function body is empty, meaning it does not implement any functionality or return any value based on these parameters. Therefore, it does not fulfill its intended purpose as described in the annotations.
