The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n` and `m` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, while `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. After executing the function body, the function returns an output based on the relationships and conditions involving these parameters. However, the specific return value and conditions are not provided in the output section. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these four integer parameters and return a value based on the defined constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, a, and b, where n and m are integers in the range [1, 10^12] and a and b are integers in the range [1, 100]. It returns a value based on the conditions involving these parameters.**
