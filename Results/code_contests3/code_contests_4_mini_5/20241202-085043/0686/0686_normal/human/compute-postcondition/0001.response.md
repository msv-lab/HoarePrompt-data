The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it relies on the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers with the condition that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\), and `a` and `b` are integers constrained by \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). The function returns a value based on these constraints. Since there are no specific case outputs provided in the instruction, the exact nature of the return value is not detailed. Therefore, the functionality of the function is based on the relationships and constraints given.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), returning a value based on these constraints.**
