Functionality: ** The function does not perform any operations or calculations as the code block is empty. It is supposed to work with positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), but as it stands, the function lacks any implementation to return a value or handle these parameters. Therefore, the current functionality is effectively non-existent. **
