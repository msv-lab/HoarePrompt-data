The function `func` accepts several parameters: `n`, `a`, `d`, and a series of tuples consisting of `ti` and `vi`. Specifically, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, and `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station. Each of the next `n` lines contains two integers `ti` and `vi`, where `ti` is the departure time (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and `vi` is the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6). 

The function processes this information and outputs a result based on the calculations involving the trolleybuses' departure times, maximum speeds, and the distance to the final station, but the exact nature of the output is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of trolleybuses), a (maximum acceleration), d (distance to the final station), and for each trolleybus, its departure time ti and maximum speed vi. It processes these inputs to return a result based on the trolleybuses' performance regarding the distance to the final station.**
