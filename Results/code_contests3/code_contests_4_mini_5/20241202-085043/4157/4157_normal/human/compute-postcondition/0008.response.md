The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned based on the input from `raw_input()`, which accepts two floating-point numbers and converts them into a tuple using `map(float, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `d`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment of `ti` and `v` from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float.**
