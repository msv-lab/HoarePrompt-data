To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables. 

1. The code calculates `t1` based on the conditional expression involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.
2. The first part of the expression checks if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. If this condition is true, `t1` is computed using the formula `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
3. If the condition is false, `t1` is calculated using the formula `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since the initial state indicates that `a`, `d`, and `v` are positive integers, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 while `i` is initialized to 0, we don't have specific values for `v`, `a`, and `d` as they are derived from `map(float, raw_input().split())`.

Thus, without specific input values for `v`, `a`, and `d`, we can only express the result in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `t1` is computed based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
