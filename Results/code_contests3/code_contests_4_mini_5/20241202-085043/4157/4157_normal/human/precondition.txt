n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5; a is an integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, with 1 <= a <= 10^6; d is an integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station, with 1 <= d <= 10^6; ti is a non-negative integer representing the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot, such that 0 <= t1 < t2 < ... < tn <= 10^6; vi is a positive integer representing the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus, with 1 <= vi <= 10^6.
