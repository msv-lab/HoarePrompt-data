n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and each of the next n lines contains two integers ti and vi (where 0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6) representing the departure time and maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus, respectively.
