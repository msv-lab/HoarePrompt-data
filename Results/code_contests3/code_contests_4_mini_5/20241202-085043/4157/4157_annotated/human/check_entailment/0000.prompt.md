You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.

A city in this country has a trolleybus depot with n trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of d meters from the depot. We know for the i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.

Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.

You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.

Input

The first input line contains three space-separated integers n, a, d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, d ≤ 106) — the number of trolleybuses, their maximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the final station, correspondingly.

Next n lines contain pairs of integers ti vi (0 ≤ t1 < t2... < tn - 1 < tn ≤ 106, 1 ≤ vi ≤ 106) — the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, correspondingly. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.

Output

For each trolleybus print a single line the time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses in the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input. The answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Examples

Input

3 10 10000
0 10
5 11
1000 1


Output

1000.5000000000
1000.5000000000
11000.0500000000


Input

1 2 26
28 29


Output

33.0990195136

Note

In the first sample the second trolleybus will catch up with the first one, that will happen at distance 510.5 meters from the depot. The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with them. It will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 11000.05 seconds.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 1,000,000), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 1,000,000), and for each trolleybus i, ti is a non-negative integer representing the departure time (0 ≤ ti ≤ 1,000,000) in strictly increasing order, and vi is a positive integer representing the maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 1,000,000).
def func():
    t = 0.0
    n, a, d = map(int, raw_input().split())
    for i in xrange(n):
        ti, v = map(float, raw_input().split())
        
        t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(
            2 * d / a)
        
        t = max(t1 + ti, t)
        
        print(t)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is the maximum value of all computed `t1 + ti` values across all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `ti` and `v` are the last pair of floats read from input before the loop finished executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters: `n`, `a`, and `d`, which represent the number of trolleybuses, the maximum acceleration, and the distance to the final station, respectively. It also reads pairs of floats representing the departure time and maximum speed for each trolleybus. For each trolleybus, it calculates a time value based on the maximum speed and acceleration, comparing this to the previous maximum time to determine the latest time a trolleybus can reach the final station. The function outputs the maximum time for each trolleybus, but it does not return any value. It is important to note that the code assumes input is provided correctly and does not handle any potential input errors or edge cases like negative values or out-of-bound values for `ti` and `vi`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
