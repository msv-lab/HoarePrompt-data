The provided Python program is intended to calculate the minimum arrival times of trolleybuses at a final station based on their departure times, maximum speeds, and the constraints of maximum acceleration and the distance to the station. However, upon reviewing the program against the problem description, there are several key issues that indicate that the program is not correct.

1. **Incorrect Time Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates `t1` using the formula:
     ```python
     t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
     ```
     This calculation does not correctly follow the rules of kinematics when considering both acceleration and the maximum speed. The formula should account for the time taken to reach maximum speed and also consider the remaining distance after achieving that speed.

2. **Collision and Following Behavior**:
   - The program does not account for the scenario where trolleybuses catch up with each other. According to the problem description, if a trolleybus catches up with another, they should travel together at the speed of the leading trolleybus. The program simply prints out the calculated time for each trolleybus without ensuring that they follow the correct behavior when one trolleybus catches up to another.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program outputs the time for each trolleybus independently, without properly considering the scenario where they may arrive together if one catches up to another. This violates the requirement that the output must reflect the correct time of arrival for each trolleybus considering all the rules provided.

Due to these discrepancies, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
