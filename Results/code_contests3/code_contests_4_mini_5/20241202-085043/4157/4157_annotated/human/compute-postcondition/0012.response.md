According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, we know that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n`, which means that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its previous value or `0.0`, `i` is now `i + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
