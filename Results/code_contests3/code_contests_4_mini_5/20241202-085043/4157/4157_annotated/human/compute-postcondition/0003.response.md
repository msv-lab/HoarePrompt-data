In this code snippet, `ti` and `v` are assigned values that are obtained from the input. The `map(float, raw_input().split())` function reads a line of input, splits it into separate components, and converts each component into a float. The exact values of `ti` and `v` will depend on what the user inputs, but the variables `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, and `i` are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ti` and `v` are now float values based on user input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input**
