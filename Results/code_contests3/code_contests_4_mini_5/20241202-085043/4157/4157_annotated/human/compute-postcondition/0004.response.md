Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input; `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d` and `v`, resulting in either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` or `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.**
