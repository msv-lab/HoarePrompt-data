The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the conditional expression. The condition checks if `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. If true, `t1` is calculated using the formula `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. If false, `t1` is calculated using the formula `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. 

The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either `t1 + ti` or `0.0`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ti` and `v` are assigned values from input as floats, and `t1` is calculated based on the conditional operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either `t1 + ti` or `0.0`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ti` and `v` are assigned values from input as floats, and `t1` is calculated based on the conditional operation.**
