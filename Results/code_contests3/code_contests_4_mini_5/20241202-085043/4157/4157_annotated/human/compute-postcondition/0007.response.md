According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a positive integer and `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Since `i` is currently less than `n`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` will become `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n` after the increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either `t1 + ti` or `0.0`, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n` and `i` is now `i + 1`**
