`ti` and `v` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `map(float, ...)` converts the values to float. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `ti` and `v` will now hold the float representations of the input values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its previous value or `0.0`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ti` is a float and `v` is a float.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its previous value or `0.0`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ti` is a float and `v` is a float.**
