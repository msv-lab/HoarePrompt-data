The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
- `a`: a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, constrained such that \(1 \leq a \leq 1,000,000\).
- `d`: a positive integer representing the distance to the final station, constrained such that \(1 \leq d \leq 1,000,000\).
- For each trolleybus \(i\):
  - `ti`: a non-negative integer representing the departure time, constrained such that \(0 \leq ti \leq 1,000,000\) and the values are in strictly increasing order.
  - `vi`: a positive integer representing the maximum speed of the trolleybus, constrained such that \(1 \leq vi \leq 1,000,000\).

The function returns a value based on the timing and speed of the trolleybuses in relation to the distance to the final station. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, d, and for each trolleybus i (ti, vi), and returns a calculation related to the trolleybuses' ability to reach the final station based on their departure times, maximum speeds, and the given distance.**
