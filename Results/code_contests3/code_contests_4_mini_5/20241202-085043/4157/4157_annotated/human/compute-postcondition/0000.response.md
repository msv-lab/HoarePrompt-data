Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000), `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 1,000,000), `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 1,000,000), `t` is 0.0, and for each trolleybus i, `ti` is a non-negative integer representing the departure time (0 ≤ ti ≤ 1,000,000) in strictly increasing order, and `vi` is a positive integer representing the maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 1,000,000).**
