To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `t1` is being assigned a value based on a conditional expression. 
2. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
3. If `d` is not greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.
4. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Given that `t` is either the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its previous value or `0.0`, and `i` is now `i + 1`, we note that the specific calculations for `t1` depend on the values of `d`, `v`, and `a`, which are not specified, but `t1` is defined based on those values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and its previous value or `0.0`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float, `t1` is calculated based on the conditional expression with respect to `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
