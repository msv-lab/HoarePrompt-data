The function reads values for the number of trolleybuses `n`, maximum acceleration `a`, and distance `d`. For each trolleybus, it takes the departure time `ti` and maximum speed `vi`, then calculates the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on its speed and the given acceleration. The function keeps track of the maximum time encountered across all trolleybuses and prints this maximum value after processing each trolleybus. The calculations also handle cases where the distance is less than or equal to the distance that can be covered under constant acceleration. The function does not handle any edge cases related to invalid input values or scenarios where the inputs do not meet the specified constraints.
