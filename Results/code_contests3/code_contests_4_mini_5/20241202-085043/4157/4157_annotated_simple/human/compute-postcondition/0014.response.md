The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. Otherwise, `t1` is computed as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`. 

The variable `t` is updated to the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`. The variables `ti` and `v` are assigned input float values, which are not specified but are assumed to be valid floats.

Since the initial state mentions that `t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`, and that `t` is assigned the maximum value based on `t1` and `ti`, the output state describes the relationships and assignments made.

Output State: **`t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`; `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `ti` and `v` are assigned input float values.**
