To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet.

1. The code assigns `t` the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`.
2. The values of `t1`, `ti`, and `t` are previously defined. The specific values of `t1`, `ti`, and `t` are not provided in the initial state, but we know they are determined by some conditions and inputs.
3. The value of `t` will be updated based on the calculation of `max(t1 + ti, t)`, which means `t` can either increase or stay the same depending on the comparison.
4. The states of `i`, `ti`, and `v` are not affected by this code snippet directly.

Since we do not have exact values for `t1`, `ti`, and `t`, we can conclude the output state based on their relationships.

Output State: **`t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`; `t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `ti` and `v` are assigned input float values.**
