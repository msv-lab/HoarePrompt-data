`ti` and `v` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()`, which returns a string that is then split into components and converted to float. The values of `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, and `i` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is the first float input, `v` is the second float input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is the first float input, `v` is the second float input**
