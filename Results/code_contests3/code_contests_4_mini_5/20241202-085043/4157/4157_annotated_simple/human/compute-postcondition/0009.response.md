To evaluate the code snippet provided, we need to analyze the assignment of `t1` based on the given conditions.

1. **Understanding Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (not directly affecting the calculation).
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `d` is a positive integer.
   - `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `0.0` (not directly relevant for `t1` calculation).
   - `i` is 1 (not directly affecting the calculation).
   - `ti` is a float input.
   - `v` is a float input.
   - `t1` is to be determined based on the condition.

2. **Evaluating the Condition**:
   - The computation of `t1` depends on the condition: `d > v * v / (2 * a)`.
   - If the condition is true, `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
   - If the condition is false, `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

3. **Output State Determination**:
   - Since the values of `d`, `v`, and `a` are known and are positive integers or floats, we can state that `t1` will be computed based on the given conditions without specifying the actual values of `d`, `v`, and `a`.

Thus, the Output State after evaluating the assignment for `t1` is as follows:

Output State: **`t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`**.
