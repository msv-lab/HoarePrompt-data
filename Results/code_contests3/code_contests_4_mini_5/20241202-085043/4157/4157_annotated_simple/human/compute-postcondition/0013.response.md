The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which is then split and converted to floats using `map`. The previous values of `t1`, `t`, and `i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of new values to `ti` and `v`. 

Output State: **`t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`; `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the previous value of `t`; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `ti` and `v` are assigned input float values.**
