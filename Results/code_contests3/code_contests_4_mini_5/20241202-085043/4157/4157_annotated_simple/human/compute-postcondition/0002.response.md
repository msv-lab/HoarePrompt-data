According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, the loop will execute `n` times, starting from `i = 0`. As `n` is positive, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. The value of `t` is initialized to 0.0 before the loop starts, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be initialized to 0, and we can state the conditions for `n`, `a`, and `d` as positive integers.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
