To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.
2. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.
3. If the condition is false, then `t1` is calculated using the formula `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.
4. Since `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` are positive integers or floats, the calculations will yield a valid float for `t1`.

Given that all variables are initialized and no specific values have been assigned, the program will compute `t1` based on the provided formulae. However, without specific values for `d`, `v`, and `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t1`.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `ti` is the first float input, `v` is the second float input, and `t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
