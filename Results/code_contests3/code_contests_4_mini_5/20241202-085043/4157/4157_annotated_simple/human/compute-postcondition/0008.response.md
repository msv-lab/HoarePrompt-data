The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned the result of `map(float, raw_input().split())`, which takes a line of input, splits it, and converts each part to a float. The variable `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, and `t1` are not affected directly by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `ti` and `v`, which are now floats based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `0.0`, `i` is 1, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input, and `t1` is determined based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`.**
