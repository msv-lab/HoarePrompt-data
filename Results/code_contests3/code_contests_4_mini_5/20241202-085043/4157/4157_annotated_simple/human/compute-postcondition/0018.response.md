The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `a`, which is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6).
- `d`, which is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6).
- For each trolleybus, there are two additional parameters: `ti`, a non-negative integer representing the time it leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6), and `vi`, a positive integer representing its maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6), with the constraint that the sequence of times satisfies 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn ≤ 10^6.

The function returns a value based on the calculations involving these parameters, but the specifics of the return value based on the input parameters are not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, d, and for each trolleybus ti and vi, then processes the inputs according to the defined relationships and constraints.**
