The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `T` is an integer that falls within the range of 1 to 100, and `X` is also an integer within the same range. However, since the function does not take any input parameters, it does not return values based on the parameters `T` and `X`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not explicitly defined in terms of input parameters or return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any output based on parameters.**
