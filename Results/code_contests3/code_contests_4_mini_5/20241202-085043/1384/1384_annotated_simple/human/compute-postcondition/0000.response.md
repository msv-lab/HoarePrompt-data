The values of `T` and `X` are not directly affected since they are not reassigned in this code snippet. Instead, `t` and `x` are assigned values based on user input split into two floating-point numbers. The previous values of `T` and `X` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` and `x` are now floating-point values derived from the input, while `T` and `X` remain as integers within their specified ranges.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100; `t` and `x` are assigned floating-point values from input.**
