Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `t` and `x` as input, where both integers must be between 1 and 100. It calculates the division of `t` by `x` and prints the result. However, it does not return any value or handle potential division errors, such as dividing by zero, which is not possible with the given constraints. **
