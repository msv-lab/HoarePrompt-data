Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, Taro studies for T hours in World B, where time passes X times faster than in World A. The correct calculation to determine how many hours pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B should be:

\[ \text{Hours in World A} = \frac{T}{X} \]

However, the program incorrectly maps the input values to `t` and `x` as floats and then calculates `t / x`. This is misleading because the variables `t` and `x` in the code do not represent the correct hours in World A and the correct speed multiplier as per the problem description.

Additionally, the program does not ensure that it handles the input according to the constraints given (1 ≤ T ≤ 100, 1 ≤ X ≤ 100), as it should take integers for T and X instead of converting them to floats immediately.

In summary, the program fails to correctly compute the required output based on the logic outlined in the problem description. It incorrectly assumes that `t` corresponds to hours in World A instead of directly taking the integer values from input, leading to incorrect results for the specified inputs.
