To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Taro studies for T hours in World B.
2. Time passes X times faster in World B than in World A.
3. We need to calculate how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

### Mathematical Interpretation:
If Taro studies for T hours in World B, then the time that passes in World A is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Time in World A} = \frac{T}{X}
\]
Where:
- T is the number of hours studied in World B.
- X is the factor by which time is faster in World B.

### Code Review:
The provided code is:
```python
(t, x) = map(float, input().split())
print(t / x)
```
- The code reads two values, `t` and `x`, from the input and converts them to float.
- It calculates `t / x` and prints the result.

### Edge Cases and Constraints:
1. **Constraints**: `1 <= T <= 100` and `1 <= X <= 100`. Therefore, T and X will always be positive integers within the given range.
2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If T = 1 and X = 100, the output should be `0.01`, which is handled correctly by the code.
   - If T = 100 and X = 1, the output should be `100.0`, which is also handled correctly.
   - Any values within the allowed range for T and X will yield valid results since the operation `t / x` will not encounter division by zero or negative numbers.

### Output Precision:
The output is expected to have an absolute or relative error of at most \(10^{-3}\). The program does not format the output explicitly, but since Python's default float printing provides sufficient precision, it should meet the requirement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the problem description and the program, I found that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as stated. Given that there are no edge cases where the program fails to produce the correct output based on the problem's requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly calculates the time passed in World A for any valid input according to the given constraints.
