The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, and `X` is also an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100. However, since the function does not take these parameters as inputs, it is unclear how they are utilized within the function or what specific output is generated based on these constraints. Therefore, without further context on how T and X are used, I cannot specify the functionality of the function accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output cannot be determined based on the provided constraints alone.**
