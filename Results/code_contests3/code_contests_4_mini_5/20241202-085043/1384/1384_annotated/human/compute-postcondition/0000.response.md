The variables `t` and `x` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which are then converted to floats using `map(float, ...)`. The initial state indicates that `T` is an integer and `X` is an integer, but after the execution of the code, `t` and `x` will both be float values based on the input provided. The integer constraints on `T` and `X` do not directly impact the output state since we are now considering `t` and `x` as floats. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float**
