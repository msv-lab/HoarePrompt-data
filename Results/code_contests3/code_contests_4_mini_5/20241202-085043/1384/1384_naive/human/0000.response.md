Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B by dividing T (the hours in World B) by X (the speed factor). This implementation adheres to the problem description and handles the provided constraints effectively:

1. For any input values of T and X within the specified constraints (1 ≤ T, X ≤ 100), the calculation `t / x` will yield the correct result.
2. The program uses floating-point division, which allows for the necessary precision, and it correctly prints the result.
3. Given the constraints, the output will always be a valid floating-point number.

The program accounts for all potential edge cases, such as when X is at its minimum (1), resulting in T hours passing in World A, and when X is at its maximum (100), leading to the smallest possible output. Thus, it meets the requirements of the problem statement for all possible input cases.
