In the provided code, `t` and `x` are assigned the values from `input()`, which returns a string of two space-separated numbers. The `map(float, input().split())` function converts these string representations of numbers into floats. The initial state specifies that `T` and `X` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, but after this line executes, `t` and `x` will be floats.

Therefore, the values of `t` and `x` are now floats, but the specific values are not defined as they are dependent on user input. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float**
