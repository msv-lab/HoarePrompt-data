Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical flaw in its handling of the substring indices. The query specifies that the substring should start at index `l_i` and end at index `r_i` (both inclusive), but the program's logic for counting occurrences of `AC` only considers the substring defined by the zero-based index `l-1` to `r-1`, which does not correctly account for the inclusive nature of the end index `r_i`.

For example, consider the input:
```
8 1
ACACTACG
2 5
```
In this case, the substring from index `2` to `5` (inclusive) in the string `S` would be `ACTA`, which contains one occurrence of `AC`. However, the program will compute the count of `AC` incorrectly because it is calculating occurrences using `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which does not accurately represent the substring requested.

Thus, the program fails to return the correct count for certain queries, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
