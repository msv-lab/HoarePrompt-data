To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements of the problem and the implementation of the program.

### Problem Description:
1. Given a string `S` of length `N` consisting of the characters `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`.
2. For `Q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)`, the program needs to count how many times the substring `AC` occurs in the substring of `S` that starts at index `l_i` and ends at index `r_i` (both inclusive).

### Implementation Analysis:
1. The program reads inputs for the length of string `N`, number of queries `Q`, the string `S`, and the pairs of indices for the queries.
2. It initializes a list `P` of size `N + 1` to keep a cumulative count of occurrences of the substring `AC`.
3. The loop iterates through the string `S` and updates the list `P`:
   - `P[i]` is incremented if the substring `S[i-1:i+1]` equals `AC`.
   - Otherwise, it carries forward the count from `P[i-1]`.
4. Finally, for each query, it calculates the result using the formula `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`.

### Correctness Check:
- The list `P` correctly maintains a cumulative count of occurrences of `AC` for indices up to `N`.
- The formula `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is used to compute the count of `AC` between indices `l` and `r`. 
  - However, since `l` and `r` are inclusive, this formula needs to be adjusted. The substring from `l` to `r` includes `AC` occurrences that may start at `l` or within that range.
  
### Issue:
- The formula `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` does not account for the count of `AC` starting from index `l` itself. Since `l` is included in the substring, it should check if `S[l-1:l+1]` is `AC` directly in addition to the cumulative counts. 
- Thus, for queries that include an `l` where `l` or `l-1` could start a new `AC`, the implementation will miss counting it.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly perform as required by the problem description due to the miscalculation of the substring boundaries when counting occurrences of `AC`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
