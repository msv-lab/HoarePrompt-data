The function accepts a string S consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with a length N, and an integer Q representing the number of queries. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in S and processes Q queries, where each query specifies a range [l, r]. For each query, it returns the number of 'AC' substrings within that range. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input values for l and r are incorrect or where the string S is empty, although such cases are constrained by the problem statement.
