The operation `print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])` indicates that values of `l` and `r` are used as indices to access the list `P`. The code snippet provided is assigning values to `l` and `r` by reading input. The previous values of `l` and `r` are unknown since they are being set by the user input.

After executing the code `l, r = map(int, raw_input().split())`, `l` and `r` will hold integer values based on the input provided. However, since we do not have any specific values for `l` and `r`, we cannot determine their exact values.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `l` and `r` are now assigned integer values based on user input, while the earlier operation and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are assigned integer values based on user input.**
