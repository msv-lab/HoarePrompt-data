According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of iterations defined by `Q`. At the end of the last iteration, `P[0]` is 0, `l` and `r` are integers from input, and the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` has been printed. Since the loop is controlled by the variable `_`, which typically represents the current iteration index, and given that the loop iterates `Q` times, if the loop has executed `Q` times already, it cannot execute again unless `Q` is greater than the number of executed iterations.

Assuming the loop has executed `Q - 1` times and the next iteration will be the `Q`th iteration, we need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `Q` must be greater than the current number of iterations (which is `Q`).

State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `P[0]` is 0, `l` and `r` are integers from input, for the loop to execute a second time `Q` must be greater than the number of iterations already executed (which is `Q`).**
