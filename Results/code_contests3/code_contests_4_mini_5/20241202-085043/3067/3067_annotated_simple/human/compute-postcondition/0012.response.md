Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[i]` cannot be assigned a value as `P[-1]` is undefined. Otherwise, `P[0]` remains 0 and `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`, which is also undefined, thus maintaining the previous state of `P[0]` being 0.***
