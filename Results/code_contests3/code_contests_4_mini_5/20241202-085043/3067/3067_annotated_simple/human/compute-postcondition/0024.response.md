`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be set to the value of `P[1] + 1`. The value of `P[1]` is not provided, but it will increment by 1 based on its previous value. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1.**
