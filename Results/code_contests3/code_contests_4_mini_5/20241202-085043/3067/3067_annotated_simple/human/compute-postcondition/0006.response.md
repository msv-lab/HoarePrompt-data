The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration, if applicable. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
