The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 0, we need to check the value of `P[i - 1]`, which would refer to `P[-1]`. However, the context indicates that `P[0]` is set to 0 and there is no specific value assigned to `P[-1]` within the provided information. Assuming `P[-1]` is undefined or does not exist, the operation cannot be completed successfully. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that the operation could not proceed due to the undefined value for `P[-1]`. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0, but `P[-1]` is undefined, so `P[i]` cannot be assigned a value.**
