In this case, the code `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` assigns the value of `P[i - 1] + 1` to `P[i]`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, we can determine that `P[1]` will be assigned the value of `P[0] + 1`. The initial state indicates that there are no changes made if `i` is not 0, but in this case, `i` is 1, so we proceed with the assignment. The initial values of `P` are not specified, which limits our ability to give an exact value for `P[1]`, but we can infer that it will be one more than whatever `P[0]` is.

The output state is then: `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `P[1]` is `P[0] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `P[1]` is `P[0] + 1**
