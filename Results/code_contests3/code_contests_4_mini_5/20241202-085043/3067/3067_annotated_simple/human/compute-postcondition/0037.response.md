Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `P[0]` is 0, `P` is a list where `P[i]` holds the count of 'AC' substrings in `S` up to index `i`, and the results of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` for each query have been printed, with `l` and `r` being integers from user input for each iteration of the loop.**
