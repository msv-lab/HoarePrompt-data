The values of `l` and `r` are assigned based on the input received through `raw_input()`, where the input values are split and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `l` and `r` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values after this assignment. The output state reflects that `l` and `r` are now assigned values from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `P[0]` is 0, `l` and `r` are assigned values from input.**
