The code initializes a list `P` with a size of `N + 1`, filled with zeros. This means that the list `P` will have `N + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `P` is a list with `N + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `P` is a list with `N + 1` zeros.**
