The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', with a length `N` such that 2 <= N <= 100000. It also accepts a parameter `Q`, which is an integer representing the number of queries, with the constraint that 1 <= Q <= 100000. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 <= l_i < r_i <= N). 

Based on this input, the function processes the queries and returns the results accordingly. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `S` of specific characters and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries, and for each query defined by the integers `l_i` and `r_i`, it performs operations related to the specified substring of `S`. The exact nature of the output for each query is not specified, but it aligns with the constraints provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N consisting of 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and an integer Q representing the number of queries, each defined by two integers l_i and r_i, and processes these queries based on the substring of S.**
