The statement `P[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the first element of the list or array `P`. However, since the initial state does not provide any information about the variable `P`, we cannot determine its previous state or whether it exists. Thus, we can only note that `P[0]` is set to `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is set to 0**
