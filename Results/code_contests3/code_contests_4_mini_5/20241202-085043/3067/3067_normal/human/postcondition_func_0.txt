The function accepts an integer `N`, an integer `Q`, and a string `S` of length `N`. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' within `S` and processes `Q` queries, each defined by a pair of integers `(l, r)`, to return the count of 'AC' pairs in the substring `S[l-1:r]`. If `l` and `r` are invalid (not satisfying `1 <= l < r <= N`), the behavior is not defined, as the code does not handle such cases.
