The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `P[0]` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
