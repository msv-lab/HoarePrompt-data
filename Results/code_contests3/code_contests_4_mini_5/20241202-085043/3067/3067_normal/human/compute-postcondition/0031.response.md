According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `Q`. If `Q` is greater than the current iteration count (which is represented by `_`), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we have computed `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` and have not yet incremented the iteration count. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `_` must be incremented by 1. Assuming that the current iteration count is `_`, after this iteration, `_` will become `_ + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `Q` must be greater than `_ + 1`.

State: **`P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` is computed, for the loop to execute a second time Q must be greater than 1, and the current iteration count `_` is 1**
