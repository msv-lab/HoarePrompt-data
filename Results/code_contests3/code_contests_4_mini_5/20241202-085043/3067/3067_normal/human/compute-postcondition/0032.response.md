The code reads two integer values from input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. The previous values of `l` and `r` are unknown since they are being assigned for the first time during this execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that `l` and `r` are now set to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
