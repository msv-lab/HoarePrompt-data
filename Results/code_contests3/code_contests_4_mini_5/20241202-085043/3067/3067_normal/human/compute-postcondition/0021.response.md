The value of `P[0]` is assigned 0. Since `P` is presumably an array or list and this assignment does not depend on the current values of `N` or `i`, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `P[0]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `P[0]` is 0**
