The list `P` is initialized with `N + 1` zeros. The previous values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged, and the string `S` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= `Q` <= 100000, `S` is an input string from raw_input(), and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= `Q` <= 100000, `S` is an input string from raw_input(), `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.**
