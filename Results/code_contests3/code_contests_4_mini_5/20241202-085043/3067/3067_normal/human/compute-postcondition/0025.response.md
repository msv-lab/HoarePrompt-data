The statement `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, we are looking at `P[2]` being assigned the value of `P[1]`. The initial state indicates no changes to `P[0]` since `i` is not 0. Therefore, `P[2]` is updated to the value of `P[1]`, while `P[0]` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000; `i` is 2; `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]`, and `P[0]` remains unchanged.**
