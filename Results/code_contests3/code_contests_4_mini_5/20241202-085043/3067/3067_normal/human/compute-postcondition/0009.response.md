The code snippet `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` assigns the value of `P[i - 1] + 1` to `P[i]`. Given that `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', it indicates that the condition for incrementing `P[i]` is satisfied. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `P[i - 1]`, meaning we can't determine the specific value of `P[i]`. Thus, we can only express that `P[i]` is now one more than `P[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', and `P[i]` is `P[i - 1] + 1`.**
