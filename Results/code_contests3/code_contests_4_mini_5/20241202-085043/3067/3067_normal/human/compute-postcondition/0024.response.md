The code assigns the value of `P[i]` based on the value of `P[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, we will access `P[2]` and assign it the value of `P[1] + 1`. The variable `P[1]` will need to be known for the calculation. However, since the values of `P` are not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `P[2]`.

The state of `N`, `i`, and any previous values for `P` that are necessary for computation are not given, but we can conclude that `P[i]` will be modified based on the value of `P[i - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `P[i]` is assigned a new value based on `P[i - 1]`, but we cannot specify the exact values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2; `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`**
