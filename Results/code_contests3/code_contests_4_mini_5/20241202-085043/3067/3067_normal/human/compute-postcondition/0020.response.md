According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

Since `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 2 (specifically, it can be 2 or higher, but `i` must remain less than `N`).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
