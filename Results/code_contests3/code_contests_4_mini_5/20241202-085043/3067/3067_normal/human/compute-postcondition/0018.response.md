The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `P[1]` will take the value of `P[0]`. The state of `P[0]` is not provided, but `P[0]` is mentioned to be assigned 0 only if `i` is 0. Since `i` is 1 in this case, we have no information about the value of `P[0]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[i]` (where `i` is 1) is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]` (which is `P[0]`), but we cannot determine its value.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000; `i` is 1; `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0]`, but the value of `P[0]` is unknown.**
