The values of `N` and `Q` are both assigned the results of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it by whitespace, and converts each part to an integer. The specific values of `N` and `Q` depend on the input provided. Other variables are not affected at this stage. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= `Q` <= 100000, and the input values for `N` and `Q` have been captured from user input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `Q` is an integer such that 1 <= `Q` <= 100000, and the input values for `N` and `Q` have been captured from user input.**
