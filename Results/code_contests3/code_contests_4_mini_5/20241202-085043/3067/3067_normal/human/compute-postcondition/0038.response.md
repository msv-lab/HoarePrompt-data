The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `Q`, and `S`. `N` is an integer representing the length of the string `S`, where `N` is constrained to be between 2 and 100,000. `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, constrained to be between 1 and 100,000. `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. For each query, there are two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, which are the bounds for the substring in `S`, constrained such that 1 <= `l_i` < `r_i` <= `N`.

The function processes these queries and returns specific outputs based on the substrings of `S` defined by each query. However, the exact nature of the output for each query is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer), Q (an integer), and S (a string of length N), and processes queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) to return results based on substrings of S.**
