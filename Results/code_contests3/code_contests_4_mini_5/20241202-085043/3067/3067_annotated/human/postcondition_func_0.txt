The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and processes multiple queries defined by integer ranges `(l, r)`. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the specified segments of the string `S`, returning the count for each query. The function assumes valid input for `l` and `r`, where `1 <= l < r <= N`. If the input does not conform to these constraints (e.g., if `l` equals or exceeds `r`), the behavior is unspecified.
