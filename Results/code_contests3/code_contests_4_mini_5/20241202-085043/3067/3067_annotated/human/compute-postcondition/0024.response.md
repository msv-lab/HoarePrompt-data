`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, `P[2]` will be assigned the value of `P[1] + 1`. The initial state mentions that `N` is at least 2, allowing `i` to be valid. The previous value of `P[1]` is unknown, so we cannot determine the specific value of `P[2]`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `P[i]` is assigned `P[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `P[i]` is assigned `P[1] + 1**
