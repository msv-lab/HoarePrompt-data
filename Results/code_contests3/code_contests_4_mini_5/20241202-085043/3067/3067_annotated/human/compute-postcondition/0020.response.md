According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The loop will continue if `N` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
