`P` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`. The initial values of `N`, `Q`, and `S` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the variable `P` is created with `N + 1` elements initialized to zero. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned the first integer input, `Q` is assigned the second integer input, `S` is assigned a string input from the user, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the first integer input, `Q` is assigned the second integer input, `S` is assigned a string input from the user, and `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.**
