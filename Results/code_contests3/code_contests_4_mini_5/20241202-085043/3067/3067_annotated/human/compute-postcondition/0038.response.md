The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It processes a string `S` of length `N`, consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where `N` is between 2 and 100,000. The function also handles multiple queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, which satisfy the constraints 1 <= `l_i` < `r_i` <= `N`. The output of the function is determined by the results of these queries.

The functionality of the function `func` is to analyze the string `S` and respond to multiple queries that request information about specific segments of the string. Each query specifies a range within the string, and the function will return results based on the analysis of that range.
