`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 1, we need the value of `P[0]` to calculate `P[1]`. The statement indicates that if `i` is 0, then `P[0]` is set to 0, but since `i` is 1, this condition does not execute. Therefore, we do not have the previous value of `P[0]` to use. 

Thus, the output state reflects that while we attempted to update `P[1]`, we do not have sufficient information about `P[0]`. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is 1; `P[1]` is assigned the value of `P[0] + 1`, but `P[0]` is unknown.**
