The variable `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes a string input from the user. The previous values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `S` now holds a string value input by the user.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the first integer input, `Q` is assigned the second integer input, `S` is assigned a string input from the user.**
