The code `P[i] = P[i - 1]` assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be assigned the value of `P[1]`. The state of `P[0]` is not affected, and the initial conditions state that `N` is at least 2, allowing the indexing of `P` to be valid. The values of other variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1]` where `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]**
