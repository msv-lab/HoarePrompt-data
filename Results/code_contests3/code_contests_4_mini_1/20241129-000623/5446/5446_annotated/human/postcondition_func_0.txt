The function reads three integers `n`, `b`, and `c` from user input, calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, and then computes the result of multiplying the minimum of `b` and `c` by the ratio divided by `n`. It finally prints the ceiling of this result as an integer. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
