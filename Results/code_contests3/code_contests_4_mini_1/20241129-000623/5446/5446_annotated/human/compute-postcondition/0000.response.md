The values of `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input values from `raw_input()`, which splits the input string into a list of integers. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, while `n` is replaced with the first integer from the input, `b` with the second integer, and `c` with the third integer. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are within the given constraints. 

Output State: **`n` is replaced by the first integer from input, `b` is replaced by the second integer from input, `c` is replaced by the third integer from input; `a` remains unchanged.**
