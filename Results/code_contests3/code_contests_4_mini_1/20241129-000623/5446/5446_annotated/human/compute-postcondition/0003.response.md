The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints provided, it operates with three variables: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function returns a value based on these variables, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, without additional context on the output of the function, we cannot specify the exact functionality.

Given the input constraints:
- `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b)
- `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 100)
- `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 100)

The function likely performs some operations related to these constraints, but the exact behavior and return value of the function remain unspecified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters; it operates with variables n, a, and b, but the specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
