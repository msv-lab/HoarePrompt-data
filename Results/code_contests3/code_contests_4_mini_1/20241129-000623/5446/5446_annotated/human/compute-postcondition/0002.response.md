To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the effects on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state specifies that `a` remains unchanged, `b` is the second integer from input, and `c` is the third integer from input. Additionally, `x` is defined as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.

2. The code snippet `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` involves several calculations:
   - `min(b, c)` calculates the minimum of `b` and `c`.
   - `float(n)` is used in the division, but the value of `n` is not defined in the initial state.
   - The multiplication `min(b, c) / float(n) * x` combines the results of the minimum value and `x`.
   - Finally, `ceil()` rounds the result up to the nearest whole number, and `int()` converts that to an integer for printing.

3. Since `n` is not specified in the initial state, the calculations involving `n` cannot be resolved to a specific numeric value. Thus, we cannot determine the final numeric output of the print statement.

Therefore, the impact of the code on the program is that it attempts to perform calculations involving variables `b`, `c`, and `x`, but the presence of `n` remains undefined.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged; `b` is the second integer from input; `c` is the third integer from input; `x` is `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c));` and `n` is undefined.**
