The variable `x` is assigned the value of `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`. The values of `b` and `c` are replaced by the second and third integers from input, respectively. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is not directly affected by this operation.

To determine the value of `x`, we need to calculate `max(b, c)` and `min(b, c)`. The output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x`.

Output State: **`a` remains unchanged; `b` is the second integer from input; `c` is the third integer from input; `x` is `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))**
