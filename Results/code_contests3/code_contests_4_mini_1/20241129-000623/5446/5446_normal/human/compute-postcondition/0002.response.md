To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code:

1. `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from input, which are not specified but are known to be integers or floats.
2. `x` is computed as `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`. This means `x` is a floating-point number derived from the maximum value of `b` and `c` divided by the minimum value of `b` and `c`.
3. The expression `min(b, c) / float(n)` calculates the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n`, which is also a float.
4. The result of `min(b, c) / float(n) * x` is then computed.
5. The `ceil` function is applied to the result, which rounds it up to the nearest integer.
6. Finally, `int` is used to convert the result of `ceil` to an integer, and this value is printed.

Since we do not have specific values for `n`, `b`, or `c`, we cannot calculate an exact output. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the computations that take place.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `c` are input values; `x` is `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`; the printed value is `int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x))`.**
