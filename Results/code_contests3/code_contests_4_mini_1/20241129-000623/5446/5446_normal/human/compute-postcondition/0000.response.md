The code takes input for three variables `n`, `b`, and `c`, and assigns them values from the input split by spaces. The values of `a` and `b` are unknown but both are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\). The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within a specific range, but the exact values of `n`, `b`, and `c` after the input are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values based on user input.

Output State: **`n`, `b`, `c` are assigned values from input, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, and `a`, `b` are positive integers with 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 100.**
