The function reads three integers `n`, `b`, and `c` from input, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 100. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then computes the ceiling of the product of the ratio and the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n`, and prints the resulting integer. The function does not handle any errors or edge cases related to the input values.
