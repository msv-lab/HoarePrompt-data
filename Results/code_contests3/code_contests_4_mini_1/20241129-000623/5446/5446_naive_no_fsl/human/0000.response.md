Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

1. The input variables are read as `n`, `b`, `c`, but according to the problem statement, they should be `n`, `a`, `b` with `a` representing the pieces of the first cake and `b` representing the pieces of the second cake.
2. The calculation of `x` in the code `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` is incorrect and does not reflect the requirement to maximize the minimum number of pieces on the plates. Instead, it calculates the ratio of the two cake piece counts, which is not relevant to the problem.
3. The output calculation `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` is also flawed because it does not consider how to distribute the pieces of each cake across the plates while adhering to the problem constraints.

For example, if we take the input `5 2 3`:
- The correct output should be `1` (as described in the problem), but due to the incorrect logic in the code, it will not yield this result.

Overall, the program fails to correctly process the input and compute the desired output based on the problem requirements.
