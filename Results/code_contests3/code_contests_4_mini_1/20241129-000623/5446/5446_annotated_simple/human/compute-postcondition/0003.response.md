The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature indicates no input parameters. However, the function relies on the constraints provided: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, where `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100). 

Since there is no output specified in the provided information, we cannot describe specific return values or cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not fully defined based on the current information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, where a and b are integers representing the number of pieces of two cakes. The return value is not specified.**
