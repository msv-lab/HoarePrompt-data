The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem description. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input but assigns them incorrectly. It uses `n` as the number of plates, `b` as the number of pieces of the first cake, and `c` as the number of pieces of the second cake. This is incorrect because the variables should correspond to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively, where `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake and `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake.

2. **Logic Error**: The calculation `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` does not represent any meaningful logic related to maximizing the minimum number of pieces on the plates. The goal is to distribute the pieces in such a way that each plate has at least `x` pieces, and this logic should involve total pieces and the number of plates.

3. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` does not follow the requirements of the problem. The calculation does not ensure that each plate gets at least one piece, and it also does not properly determine the maximum possible value of `x` that satisfies the distribution conditions.

### Example Case:
For the input `5 2 3`, the correct output should be `1`. However, the program's logic does not guarantee that it would return the correct result based on the defined conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because:
- It misassigns the input variables.
- It uses incorrect logic to calculate the maximum possible `x`.
- The output does not reflect the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, the output should be:
Correctness: **False**
