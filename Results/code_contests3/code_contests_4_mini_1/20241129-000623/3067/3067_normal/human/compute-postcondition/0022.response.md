The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `P[0]` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
