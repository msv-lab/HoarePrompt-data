The function `func` accepts parameters `S`, `N`, `Q`, and a list of queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. Here, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where `N` is an integer satisfying the constraint \(2 \leq N \leq 100000\), and `Q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq Q \leq 100000\). Each query consists of two integers \(l_i\) and \(r_i\) satisfying \(1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N\). 

The function returns the count of occurrences of each character ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the substring of `S` defined by each query pair \((l_i, r_i)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a string `S` and a series of queries to return character counts for specified substrings of `S`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N, an integer Q representing the number of queries, and for each query defined by (l_i, r_i), it returns the count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the substring S[l_i:r_i].**
