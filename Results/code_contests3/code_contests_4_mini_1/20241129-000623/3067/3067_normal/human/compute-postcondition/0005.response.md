The variable `P[0]` is assigned the value `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `N` or `i`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is assigned the value 0**.
