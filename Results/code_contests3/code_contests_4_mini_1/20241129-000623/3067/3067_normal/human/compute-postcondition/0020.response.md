According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Since `N` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
