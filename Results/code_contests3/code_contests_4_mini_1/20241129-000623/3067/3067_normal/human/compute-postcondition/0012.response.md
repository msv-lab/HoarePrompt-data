Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 0. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, if the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is not equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`.***
