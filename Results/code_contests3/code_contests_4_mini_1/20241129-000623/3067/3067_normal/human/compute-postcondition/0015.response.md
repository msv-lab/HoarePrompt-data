The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
