The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC', we can infer that the previous state of `P[i - 1]` is used to determine the new value of `P[i]`. The values of `N` and `i` do not affect the calculation of `P[i]` directly, but `i` must be at least 1 for `P[i - 1]` to be valid. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the relationship between `P[i]` and `P[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1**.
