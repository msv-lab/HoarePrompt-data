`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 1, `P[1]` will be calculated based on the value of `P[0]`. The value of `P[0]` remains unchanged as `i` is not 0, so `P[1]` will be equal to `P[0] + 1`. The state of `N` and `i` is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `P[1]` is `P[0] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `P[1]` is `P[0] + 1**
