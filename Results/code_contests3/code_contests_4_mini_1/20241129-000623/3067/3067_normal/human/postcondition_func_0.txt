The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. For each query defined by the indices `(l_i, r_i)`, it returns the count of the substring 'AC' in `S` between the indices `l_i` and `r_i`. However, it does not count occurrences of 'G' and 'T', which is a discrepancy from the annotations. The function also assumes valid input for `l` and `r`, where `1 <= l < r <= N`.
