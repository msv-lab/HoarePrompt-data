`P[0]` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `N` remains greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is still 0, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `P[0]` is 0**
