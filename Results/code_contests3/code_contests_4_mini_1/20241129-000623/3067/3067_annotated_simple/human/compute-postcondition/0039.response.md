Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` of length `N`, an integer `N`, and an integer `Q`. It calculates the number of contiguous occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the string `S` and processes `Q` queries, where each query specifies a range defined by indices `l` and `r`. For each query, it returns the count of occurrences of 'AC' in the substring `S[l-1:r-1]`. The function assumes valid input for ranges defined by `l` and `r` according to the constraints provided. **
