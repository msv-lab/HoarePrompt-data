The loop processes a number of queries `Q`, each time reading two integers `l` and `r` from input and calculating the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. After all iterations of the loop, the values of `N` and `P` remain unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` will hold the last values assigned from the input for the final iteration, but their specific values depend on the input provided. The output will consist of the results of the difference calculations for each query printed during the loop's execution.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `P` is a list of length `N + 1`, `l` and `r` hold the last input values, and the result of `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` has been printed for each of the `Q` queries.**
