`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be updated with the value of `P[1] + 1`. The values of `N` and `P` are not explicitly stated, but `N` is greater than or equal to 1, allowing `i` to be valid. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1] + 1**
