According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop can execute a second time. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. For the loop to execute again, `N` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
