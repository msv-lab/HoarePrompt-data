The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will be assigned the value of `P[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and we know that `N` is greater than or equal to 1 but do not have further information about the values in `P`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is set to the value of `P[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is set to the value of `P[1]**
