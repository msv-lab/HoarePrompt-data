The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1; `P[0]` is assigned the value 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1; `P[0]` is assigned the value 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
