The function `func` accepts parameters `S`, `N`, and `Q`. Here, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. `N` is an integer that represents the length of the string and satisfies the condition \(2 \leq N \leq 100000\). `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries, where \(1 \leq Q \leq 100000\). Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, such that \(1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N\). 

The function processes these queries and returns the results based on the substrings of `S` defined by the indices in each query. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `S`, an integer `N` representing the length of `S`, an integer `Q` representing the number of queries, and for each query defined by indices `l_i` and `r_i`, it performs some operations on the corresponding substring of `S`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N, an integer N, and an integer Q, and processes Q queries involving substrings of S defined by pairs of indices l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.**
