The value of `S` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which captures user input as a string. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer, `Q` is an integer, and `S` is a string from user input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string from user input**
