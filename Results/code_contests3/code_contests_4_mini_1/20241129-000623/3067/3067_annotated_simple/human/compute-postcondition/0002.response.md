`P` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`. The value of `N` is an integer, so `P` will be a list containing `N + 1` zeros. The values of `Q` and `S` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string from user input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `Q` is an integer, `S` is a string from user input, `P` is a list of length `N + 1` filled with zeros.**
