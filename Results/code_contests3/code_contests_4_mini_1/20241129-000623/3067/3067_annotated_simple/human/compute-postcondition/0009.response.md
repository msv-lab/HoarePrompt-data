`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `P[0]` is set to 0, `P[i - 1]` will also be 0 because `i` is 0. Therefore, `P[i]` will be 0 + 1, resulting in `P[i]` being 1. The other variables retain their prior values. Hence, the Output State is: `N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0, `P[i]` is 1, and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC'.

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0, `P[i]` is 1, and the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is equal to 'AC'**.
