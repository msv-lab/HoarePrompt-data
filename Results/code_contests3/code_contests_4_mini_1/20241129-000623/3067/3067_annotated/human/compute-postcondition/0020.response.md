According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range specified by `N`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
