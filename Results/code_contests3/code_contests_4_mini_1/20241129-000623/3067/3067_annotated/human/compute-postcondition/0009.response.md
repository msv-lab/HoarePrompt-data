The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. The value of `P[i - 1]` is not provided, but since `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', it indicates that this operation is being executed in a specific context where the previous value of `P[i - 1]` is defined. The other variables `N` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', and `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', and `P[i]` is set to `P[i - 1] + 1**.
