The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]`. The previous value of `P[i - 1]` is unknown, but it is important to note that `P[i]` takes on that value. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` remains satisfied. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment and the unchanged conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 0, `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1]**
