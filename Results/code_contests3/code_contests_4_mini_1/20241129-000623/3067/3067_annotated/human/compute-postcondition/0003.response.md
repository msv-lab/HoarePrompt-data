According to the code, the loop will execute `N` times, where `N` is an integer between 2 and 100,000. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `N-1` during the iterations. Since `N` is already defined as being within the specified range, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to 0 to be ready for the first iteration. The other variables `Q`, `S`, and `P` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they may relate to the loop's body, which is omitted. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
