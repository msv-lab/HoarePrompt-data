The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 2, `P[2]` will be calculated based on the value of `P[1]`. The initial state does not provide information about the value of `P[1]`, so we cannot determine the exact value of `P[2]`. However, the program state remains unchanged for other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is `P[1] + 1` (where `P[1]` is unknown).

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, and `P[2]` is `P[1] + 1` (where `P[1]` is unknown)**.
