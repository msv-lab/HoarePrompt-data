Output State: **`P` is a list where `P[i]` contains the count of 'AC' substrings in `S` for `0 <= i < N`; `l` and `r` are integers representing the ranges input by the user; the output consists of the differences `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]` for each query executed, indicating the counts of 'AC' substrings in the specified ranges.**
