According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is less than `N` (where `N` is between 2 and 100000). This means the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains less than `N`. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**.
