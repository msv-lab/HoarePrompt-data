`P` is assigned a list of zeros with a length of `N + 1`. This means that `P` will contain `N + 1` elements, all initialized to 0. The values of `N` and `Q` remain unaffected, as well as the string `S`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries; `S` is an input string; `P` is a list of zeros with length `N + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000; `Q` is an integer representing the number of queries; `S` is an input string; `P` is a list of zeros with length `N + 1.**
