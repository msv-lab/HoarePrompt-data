The code assigns the value of `P[i - 1]` to `P[i]`. Since `i` is 2, this means `P[2]` will take the value of `P[1]`. The state of the other variables (`N` and `i`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 100000, `i` is 2, `P[2]` is assigned the value of `P[1]**
