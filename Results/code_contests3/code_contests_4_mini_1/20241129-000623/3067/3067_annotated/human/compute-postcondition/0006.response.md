The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and proceed to the next iteration. The states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 100000, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
