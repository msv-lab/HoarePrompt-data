The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string composed of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' with a length `N` that satisfies the condition 2 <= N <= 100000. Additionally, the function processes multiple queries, each consisting of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, where 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N, defining valid substring indices. The function returns results based on these queries. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S of length N (2 <= N <= 100000) and processes multiple queries defined by pairs of indices (l_i, r_i) to return results based on the specified substrings of S.**
