The function accepts a string `S` of length `N` (where 2 <= N <= 100000) and processes `Q` queries, each defined by a pair of indices `(l, r)`. For each query, it calculates and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' within the substring of `S` defined by those indices. The function uses a prefix sum array to efficiently count the number of 'AC' substrings from the start of the string up to various points. However, it does not handle cases where the input indices are out of bounds or invalid, which could lead to runtime errors.
