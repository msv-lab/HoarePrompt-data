Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic as specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Indexing Issues**: The problem statement specifies that the indices `l_i` and `r_i` are 1-based, while the implementation uses 0-based indexing. The adjustment made in the program when accessing the prefix sum array `P` is incorrect. The program uses `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which does not account correctly for the 1-based nature of `l` and `r` as defined in the problem. Specifically, the correct adjustment would be `P[r - 1] - P[l - 2]` to include the count correctly based on the definitions given.

2. **Prefix Array Initialization**: The program initializes `P[0]` to 0 and does not set `P[1]` correctly in the context of counting 'AC' substrings. The loop starts from `i = 0`, which means it might not accurately capture counts for the first valid indices, especially when querying from the start of the string.

3. **Query Response**: The output logic does not handle cases where `l` and `r` might lead to out-of-bounds access in the `P` array. Although the constraints ensure that they won't in the given problem description, the implementation does lack explicit validation and could lead to runtime errors if the input were to deviate from expected formats.

4. **Overall Logic**: The logic assumes that the prefix sum array will correctly count 'AC' substrings throughout the entire string. However, indexing issues undermine this fundamental assumption.

Due to these issues, the program may not consistently return the correct count of 'AC' substrings as required by the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
