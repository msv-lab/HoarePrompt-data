Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of the substring "AC" within the specified ranges in the string `S`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program functions:

1. It reads the values of `N` (length of the string) and `Q` (number of queries).
2. It initializes a prefix sum array `P` to keep track of the cumulative count of "AC" substrings up to each position in the string.
3. The loop iterates through the string `S` from the start to the end. For each character, it checks if the current and the previous character form the substring "AC". If they do, it increments the count in the prefix array `P`.
4. After building the prefix sum array, it processes each query by simply calculating the difference between two entries in `P` to find the count of "AC" substrings in the specified range.

The program adheres to the problem constraints and handles all edge cases correctly, as it ensures:
- The indices for the queries are valid and within the limits defined in the problem statement.
- The output correctly reflects the number of occurrences of "AC" for every query based on the established prefix sums.

Since I cannot identify any input case where the program would fail to meet the problem requirements, the program is deemed correct.
