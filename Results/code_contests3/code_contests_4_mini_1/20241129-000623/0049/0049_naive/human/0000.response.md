Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks for adjacent characters in the string `c` to determine if it can find a substring that can be reversed to obtain a lexicographically smaller string. However, it fails to consider cases where non-adjacent characters can be reversed to produce a smaller string. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
abcde
```
In this case, the string is strictly increasing, so the program would output "NO". However, if we reverse the substring from index 1 to 4 (i.e., "bcde" -> "edcb"), the resulting string would be "aedc". This is indeed lexicographically smaller than "abcde".

The program does not account for the possibility of reversing longer substrings that might lead to a smaller lexicographic result, which is a critical aspect of the problem description. Hence, it does not fulfill the requirements fully, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
