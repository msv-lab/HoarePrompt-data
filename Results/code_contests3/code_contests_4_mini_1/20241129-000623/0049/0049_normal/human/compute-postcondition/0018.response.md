Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is `n - 2`, `flag` is True indicating that at least one `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]` (if such an occurrence exists); or `flag` is True and `pos` may be undefined if there are other conditions not met.***
