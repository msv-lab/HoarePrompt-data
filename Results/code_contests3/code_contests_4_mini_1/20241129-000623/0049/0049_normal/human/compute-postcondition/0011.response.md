`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, `pos` is 1, and `flag` remains True. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, `pos` is 1, and `flag` remains True.**
