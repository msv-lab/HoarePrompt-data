Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000. If `flag` is True, then "YES" is printed along with the outputs `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is defined as the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`. If `flag` is False, then "NO" is printed, and `pos` is either undefined or represents the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is not greater than `c[i + 1]`.***
