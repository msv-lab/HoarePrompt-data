According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 (2 ≤ n ≤ 300000), the expression `n - 1` will always yield a positive integer value (at least 1), which means the loop will execute at least once.

Before the first execution of the loop, the variable `i` will start at 0. The variable `flag` does not affect the loop execution itself but may be relevant to the loop body.

Thus, to summarize the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is 0, `flag` is False for the loop to execute the first time.**
