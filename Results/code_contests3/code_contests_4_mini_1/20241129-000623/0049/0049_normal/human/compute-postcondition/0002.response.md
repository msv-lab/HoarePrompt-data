`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which takes user input as a string. The value of `n` remains unchanged as this code only affects `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `c` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `c` is a string input from the user.**
