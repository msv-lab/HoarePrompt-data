Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one index `i` such that `s[i]` is greater than `s[i + 1]`. If such an index exists, it prints "YES" and the 1-based indices of that pair (i + 1, i + 2). If no such occurrences exist, it prints "NO". The function does not handle input errors or cases where the string is not of the specified length. **
