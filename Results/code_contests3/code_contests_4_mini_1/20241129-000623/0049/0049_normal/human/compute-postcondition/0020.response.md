The `print` function outputs the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. Given that `pos` is the index of the last occurrence where `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, and that `flag` is True indicating at least one such occurrence exists, `pos` has a defined value. 

Since `pos` is an index, we can conclude that it is a non-negative integer. Thus, the output will be `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, which are consecutive integers starting from the value of `pos + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is based on the values printed:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, `i` is `n - 2`, `flag` is True, `pos` is defined, and "YES" is printed; outputs are `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.**
