Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description. The main issue lies in how it determines if a substring can be reversed to create a lexicographically smaller string.

### Issues:
1. **Substring Selection Logic**: The program only checks adjacent pairs of characters (i.e., `c[i] > c[i + 1]`). This check is insufficient because it may not capture all scenarios where a substring reversal could lead to a smaller string. For instance, consider the string "cbade". Here, reversing the substring "ba" (from indices 2 to 3) would yield "cabde", which is lexicographically smaller than the original string, but the program would not identify this since it does not check non-adjacent possible substrings.

2. **Missing Output Cases**: If the string is strictly increasing (like "abcdef"), the program correctly outputs "NO". However, it does not check for more complex cases that could yield a lexicographically smaller string through the reversal of longer substrings.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the string "cbade":
- The program checks pairs and finds that `c[0] > c[1]` (since 'c' > 'b'), so it identifies (1, 2) as a valid output.
- But if the program had checked substrings more comprehensively, it would have found that reversing "bad" (indices 2 to 4) would lead to "cadbe", which is still smaller than "cbade", and thus should output a valid substring.

This demonstrates that the program does not cover all cases and thus does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description.
