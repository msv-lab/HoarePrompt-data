Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` (the length of the string) and a string `c` of that length. It does so in a way that adheres to the specified input format.

2. **Lexicographical Comparison**: The key part of the problem is to determine if there exists an index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. This indicates that reversing the substring from `i` to `i + 1` will result in a string that is lexicographically smaller. The program effectively checks for such an index using a loop that iterates through the string.

3. **Output**: If the condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` is satisfied for any `i`, the program sets a flag and records the position `pos`. After the loop, if the flag is `True`, it prints "YES" along with the positions of the characters that can be reversed. If no such index is found, it correctly prints "NO".

4. **Boundary Conditions**: The program ensures that it only checks pairs of characters, thus respecting the constraints of the substring reversal. It also ensures that the indices printed are 1-based as required by the problem statement.

5. **Efficiency**: The algorithm runs in O(n) time complexity, which is efficient given the constraints (up to 300,000 characters). This meets the performance requirements for the problem.

Overall, the program fulfills all aspects of the problem description by correctly identifying a substring that, when reversed, produces a lexicographically smaller string, or determines that it is impossible to do so. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
