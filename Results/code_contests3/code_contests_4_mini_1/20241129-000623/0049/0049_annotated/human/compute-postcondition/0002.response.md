`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to the first integer from the input, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `c` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the first integer from the input, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000; `c` is an input string.**
