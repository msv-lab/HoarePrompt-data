Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is any index `i` in the string such that the character at index `i` is greater than the character at index `i + 1`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' along with the positions (1-based index) of the characters at `i` and `i + 1`. If no such index exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input format is invalid or where `s` is not of the specified length.**
