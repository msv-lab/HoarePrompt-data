According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `0` to `n - 2`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` and `n` is at least `2`, which allows for the loop to execute again when `i` is incremented.

In this case, after the first iteration, `i` will be increased by `1`, making it `1`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is still less than `n - 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least `3` (since `i` will be `1`, and `n - 1` must be greater than `1`).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3.**
