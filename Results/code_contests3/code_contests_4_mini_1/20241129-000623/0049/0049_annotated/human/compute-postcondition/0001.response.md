The value of `n` is updated to hold the first element of the list obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The previous value of `n` was a list of integers, and now it is assigned to just the first element of that list. The range of possible values for `n` is still maintained as the first element will also be an integer satisfying 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the first integer from the input, where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000**
