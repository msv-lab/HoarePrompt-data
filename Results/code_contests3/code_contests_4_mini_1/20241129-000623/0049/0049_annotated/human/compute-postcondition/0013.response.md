According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means the maximum value for `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Since `n` is at least 2, `i` must be less than `n - 1`, which requires `n` to be at least 3 (as `i` would need to be less than 2 for the loop to execute again).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 3**
