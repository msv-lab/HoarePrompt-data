The code snippet prints `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. The variable `pos` is the index of the last pair of adjacent characters in `c` where `c[pos]` is greater than `c[pos + 1]`. Since `n` is at least 2, `pos` must be at least 0, which ensures that both `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` are valid indices for the output. The actual values printed will depend on the specific value of `pos`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last adjacent pair, and 'YES' is printed along with the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last adjacent pair, 'YES' is printed, and the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` are printed.**
