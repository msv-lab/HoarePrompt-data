The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer constrained between 2 and 300,000 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s` that meets the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a string s of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
