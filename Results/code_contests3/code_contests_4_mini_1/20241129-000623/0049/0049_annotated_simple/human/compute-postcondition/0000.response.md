The value of `n` is reassigned with the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into parts, and converts each part into an integer. Since `n` was initially defined as an integer, it will now hold a map object that can be converted into a list of integers based on the input provided. The `s` string remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a map object holding integers from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`n` is a map object holding integers from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
