`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, after execution, `pos` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`n` and `flag`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is 2**
