Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If `flag` is True, indicating that there is at least one pair of adjacent characters in `c` where the first character is greater than the second, then 'YES' is printed, along with the values `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`, where `pos` is the index of the last such pair. If `flag` is False, indicating there are no such pairs, 'NO' is printed and `pos` is undefined.***
