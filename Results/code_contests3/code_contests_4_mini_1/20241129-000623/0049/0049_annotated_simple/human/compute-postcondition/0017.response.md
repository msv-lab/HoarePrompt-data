Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True if there exists at least one pair of adjacent characters in `c` where the first character is greater than the second, otherwise `flag` is False. `pos` is the index of the last such pair where `c[pos]` is greater than `c[pos + 1]` if `flag` is True, otherwise `pos` is undefined.**
