Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks for adjacent character pairs in the string where the first character is greater than the second. If such a pair is found, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of the pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. It should be noted that if there are no adjacent pairs that meet this condition, the output will be 'NO' without any additional information. **
