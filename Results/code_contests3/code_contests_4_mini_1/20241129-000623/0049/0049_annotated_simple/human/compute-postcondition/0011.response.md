`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 1, `pos` will also be set to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is 1**
