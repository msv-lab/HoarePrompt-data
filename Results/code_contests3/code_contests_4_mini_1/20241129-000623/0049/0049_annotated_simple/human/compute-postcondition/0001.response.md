The value of `n` is assigned the first element of the map object, `n[0]`. Since `n` is a map object holding integers from input, `n[0]` retrieves the first integer from that map. The string `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
