The variable `c` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The previous values of `n` and `s` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `s`, while including the new input value for `c`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from input, `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string**
