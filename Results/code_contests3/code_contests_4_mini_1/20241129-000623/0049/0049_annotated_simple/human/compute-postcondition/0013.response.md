According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop is set to run for `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, so it can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and we know `n` is at least 2, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2, and the loop can execute again if `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
