To determine the correctness of the provided program, we analyze the requirements specified in the problem description.

The program needs to calculate how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B, given that time passes X times faster in World B. 

From the problem description, the relationship can be described as follows:
- If Taro studies for T hours in World B, then the time that passes in World A is given by the formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Time in World A} = \frac{T}{X}
  \]

The program correctly implements this logic using the following line of code:
```python
print(t / x)
```
where `t` is the number of hours Taro studies in World B and `x` is the factor by which time is faster in World B.

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
1. Minimum Values:
   - For `T = 1` and `X = 1`, the output should be:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1} = 1.0
     \]
   - The program will output `1.0`, which is correct.

2. Maximum Values:
   - For `T = 100` and `X = 100`, the output should be:
     \[
     \frac{100}{100} = 1.0
     \]
   - The program will output `1.0`, which is correct.

3. Variable X:
   - For `T = 8` and `X = 3`, the output should be:
     \[
     \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.6666666667
     \]
   - The program will output `2.6666666667`, which matches the expected output.

4. When X is 100:
   - For `T = 1` and `X = 100`, the output should be:
     \[
     \frac{1}{100} = 0.01
     \]
   - The program will output `0.01`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After checking various edge cases and the general logic of the program against the problem requirements, it is determined that the program correctly calculates the time in World A for all valid inputs specified in the constraints.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct because it accurately implements the formula required by the problem statement for all potential input cases.
