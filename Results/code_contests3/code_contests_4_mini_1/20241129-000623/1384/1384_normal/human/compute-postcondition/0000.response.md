The variables `t` and `x` are assigned values based on the output of `input()`, which accepts two space-separated values. The `map(float, ...)` function converts these values to float type. The initial state indicates that `T` and `X` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, but the final values of `t` and `x` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t` and `x` are now floats, and their specific values will be determined by the input.

Output State: **`t` is a float, `x` is a float, and their values are determined by the input.**
