The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\) and `X` is an integer such that \(1 \leq X \leq 100\). Since these values are implied to be used within the function, the behavior of the function and its output depend on the values of `T` and `X`. 

Given the lack of detailed output information, we cannot specify the exact return values or conditions that lead to different outputs. Therefore, we can conclude that the functionality of the function relates to the constraints on `T` and `X`.

Functionality: **The function operates with constraints that T is an integer between 1 and 100, and X is an integer between 1 and 100, but it does not accept any parameters directly.**
