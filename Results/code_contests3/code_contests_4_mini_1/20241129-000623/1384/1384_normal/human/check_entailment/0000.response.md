The provided code is as follows:

```python
(t, x) = map(float, input().split())
print(t / x)
```

The problem description states that Taro has to study for T more hours in World B, where time passes X times as fast. The task is to calculate how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The formula to determine how many hours pass in World A is `T / X`. This is derived from the relationship that for every `t` hours in World A, `X * t` hours pass in World B. Thus, if Taro studies for `T` hours in World B, the equivalent time that passes in World A is `T / X`.
2. The constraints specify that both T and X are integers ranging from 1 to 100. However, the code reads them as floats, which can introduce unnecessary precision issues even though it won't break the logic here.

### Edge Cases:
1. The code does not handle the scenario where `X` is zero. However, according to the constraints, `X` will always be at least 1, so this specific case won't occur. But if the constraints were different, it would lead to a division by zero error.
2. The problem states that the output should be correct within an absolute or relative error of `10^{-3}`. The code does not explicitly format the output to ensure it meets this precision requirement, although Python's default print formatting should usually suffice for the given constraints.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the code accepts two float values, performs the division, and prints the result. They also mention the lack of handling for division by zero, which, while not applicable here due to constraints, is a valid concern in general coding practices.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for the given constraints. There are no potential cases where the code would fail given the specified input ranges. Therefore, despite the lack of explicit error handling or type enforcement, the code operates correctly under the defined conditions.

Correctness: **True**.
