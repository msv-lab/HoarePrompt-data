The variables `t` and `x` are assigned values through the `input().split()` method, which takes a single line of input and splits it into separate components. The `map(float, ...)` function converts these components into floating-point numbers. The initial state indicates that `T` and `X` are integers within the range of 1 to 100, but after conversion, `t` and `x` will be floating-point numbers. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float.**
