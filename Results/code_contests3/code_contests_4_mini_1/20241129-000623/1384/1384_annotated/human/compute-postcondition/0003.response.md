Functionality: ** The function does not accept parameters and reads two floating-point numbers from user input. It then calculates and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second. If the second number is zero, a division by zero error will occur, but the function does not handle this case. The function assumes that the inputs are constrained between 1 and 100, but it does not enforce these constraints.**
