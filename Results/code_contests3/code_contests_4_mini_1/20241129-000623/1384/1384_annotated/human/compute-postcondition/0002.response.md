The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it uses two integer variables, `T` and `X`, where `T` is constrained to be between 1 and 100, and `X` is also constrained to be between 1 and 100. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without details on the output or behavior of the function based on the values of `T` and `X`, we cannot determine its functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and relies on two variables, T and X, both constrained to be integers between 1 and 100, but the output is not specified.**
