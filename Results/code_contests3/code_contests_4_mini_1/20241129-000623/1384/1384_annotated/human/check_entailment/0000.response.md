Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program reads two floating-point numbers (`t` and `x`) from input and calculates `t / x`. However, according to the problem description, the function should compute how many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B, which is given by the formula:

\[ \text{hours in World A} = \frac{T}{X} \]

Where:
- `T` is the number of hours Taro studies in World B.
- `X` is the time dilation factor.

The program mistakenly uses `t` (which is not specified to be equivalent to `T`) and `x` instead of the correct interpretation of the variables. Furthermore, it also uses floating-point numbers, which may introduce unnecessary precision issues, whereas the problem specifies that inputs are integers.

In summary, the program does not align with the problem requirements in terms of variable usage and calculation, thus failing to produce the correct output consistent with the specified problem description.
