Correctness: **False**.

The program has a flaw in its input handling and output formatting. While it correctly calculates the time that will pass in World A using the formula \( \text{time in World A} = \frac{t}{x} \), it does not ensure that the output is formatted correctly to meet the requirement of having at most \( 10^{-3} \) error in absolute or relative terms.

Specifically, the output should be formatted to a precision that matches the expected output shown in the examples, which requires the output to be printed with a specific number of decimal places. The current implementation does not specify this, which can lead to outputs that are not formatted as expected.

For example:
- Input: `8 3`
- Expected Output: `2.6666666667`
- Actual Output: `2.6666666666666665` (if printed directly, which may vary depending on the Python environment).

Thus, the program does not handle the requirement to print the output with sufficient precision, leading to incorrect results in terms of formatting.
