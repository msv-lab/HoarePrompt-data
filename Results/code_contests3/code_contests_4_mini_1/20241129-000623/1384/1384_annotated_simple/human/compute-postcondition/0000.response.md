The values of `t` and `x` are assigned from the input using `map(float, input().split())`, which takes two space-separated values from the input and converts them to floats. The previous values of `T` and `X` are not directly affected, but now `t` and `x` are floating-point representations of the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float representation of the first input value; `x` is a float representation of the second input value.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` is a float representation of the first input value; `x` is a float representation of the second input value.**
