The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, both `T` and `X` are integers with specific ranges (1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100), but since they are not input parameters for the function, they do not directly influence the return value in the context provided. The output behavior of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine a return value or cases based on the constraints given. Therefore, we can conclude that the functionality of the function cannot be clearly defined without additional context or output information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
