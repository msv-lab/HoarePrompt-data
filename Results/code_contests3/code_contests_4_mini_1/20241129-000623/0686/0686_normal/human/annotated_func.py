#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12; a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and contains no executable code, so it does not perform any operations or return any values. Therefore, it effectively does nothing.
