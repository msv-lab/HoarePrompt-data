The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, there are two sets of variables: `n` and `m` which are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^{12}), and `a` and `b` which are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). However, since no specific output conditions or return values are provided for this function, we cannot determine the behavior based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified in the provided information.**
