Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not contain any implementation (it is represented by `{}`), which means it has no logic to address the problem statement. Therefore, it cannot handle any input or compute the minimal cost to ensure the number of commentary boxes is divisible by the number of delegations. 

One potential case to illustrate the absence of logic is the input `9 7 3 8`. The expected output should be `15`, as the program needs to build 5 boxes to have a total of 14 boxes, costing 3 burles each. Since the program does not even attempt to perform the calculations or logic necessary to determine the correct output, it is incorrect.
