The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it works with certain constraints for the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers satisfying the condition \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^{12}\).
- `a` and `b` are integers satisfying the condition \(1 \leq a, b \leq 100\).

Since there is no specific output description provided in the prompt, I will summarize the structure based on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function operates with positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100). However, the specific return value or behavior of the function is not described.**
