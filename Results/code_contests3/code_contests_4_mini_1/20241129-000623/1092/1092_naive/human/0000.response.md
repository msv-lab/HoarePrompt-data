Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple words with capital letters. Specifically, it only keeps track of the volume of the last word processed in the loop, rather than comparing the volume of each word to find the maximum volume.

For example, consider the input:
```
30
This is A Test Case
```
The expected output is `2`, as the word "This" has 1 capital letter, "A" has 1 capital letter, and "Test" also has 1 capital letter, but the program will output `1` because it only considers the last word "Case", which has 1 capital letter.

Thus, the program fails to find the correct maximum volume when there are multiple words with varying volumes.
