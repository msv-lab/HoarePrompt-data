Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description due to the way it calculates the volume of the text. The key issue is that the program calculates the volume of each individual word and then uses the maximum volume found among those words. However, it does not account for the fact that the volume of the text should be based on the number of capital letters in each word, not the maximum volume from a single word.

For example, consider the input:

```
28
AB CD EF GH
```

The expected output should be 2, as the maximum number of capital letters in any single word is 2 (in "AB"). However, if we consider the input:

```
10
A B C D E
```

The expected output is 1, since each word has one capital letter. But the current logic of the program would return 1 as it correctly finds the maximum from the individual counts.

The program, however, fails to handle cases where words can contain mixed upper and lower case letters properly if it does not strictly return the maximum count of capitals correctly across multiple words.

Moreover, the program uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3 (it would raise an error if not run in a Python 2 environment). 

Thus, there are flaws in both the handling of the calculation logic and compatibility with Python versions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
