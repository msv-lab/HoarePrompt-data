The value of `s` is incremented by 1, which changes its value from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `s` is 2, `j` is the second character in the string `i`.
