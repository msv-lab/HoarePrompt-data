The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l` and a non-empty string, `s` is 2, `j` is the second character in the string `i`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `len(i)` must be greater than 1.
