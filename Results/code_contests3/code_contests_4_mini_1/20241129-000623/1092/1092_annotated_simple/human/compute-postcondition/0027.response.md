`s` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `s` is 3, and `j` is the third character in the string `i`.
