The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 2, and `j` is the second character in the string `i`.
