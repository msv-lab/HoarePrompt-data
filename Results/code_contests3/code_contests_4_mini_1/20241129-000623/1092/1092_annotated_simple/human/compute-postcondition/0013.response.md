The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially set to 2, after execution, `s` becomes 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is 3, `j` is the third character of `i`.
