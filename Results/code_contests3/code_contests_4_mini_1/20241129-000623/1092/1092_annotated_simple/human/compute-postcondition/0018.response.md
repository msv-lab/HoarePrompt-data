The value of `s` is assigned to 0. This directly changes the previous value of `s`, which was the count of uppercase characters in the string `i`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `s` is 0, `j` is the last character in the string `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is the maximum of 0 and 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, `s` is 0, `j` is the last character in the string `i`.**
