`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` (the total count of uppercase letters in `i`) and `m` (the count of uppercase letters in `i` or 0). The value of `s` is derived from the string `i`, which is the third word in the list `l`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is updated to the maximum of `s` and the previous value of `m`, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in `i`, and `j` is the last character in the string `i`.
