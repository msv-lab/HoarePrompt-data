Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list `l`. If `j` is an uppercase character, then `s` is set to 2 and `j` remains the second character of `i`. If `j` is not uppercase, the values of `n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged.***
