According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is the current character being processed from `i`. The loop will execute again for the next character in the string `i`.

Given that `j` is currently the second character of `i`, the next character will be the third character. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the third character of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, `s` is set to 2, `j` is the third character of `i`.**
