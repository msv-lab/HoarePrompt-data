The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` is initially 0, after the execution of the code, `s` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l` and a non-empty string, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character in the string `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.
