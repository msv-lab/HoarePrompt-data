Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 inclusive, `m` is either 2 or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list `l` and a non-empty string. If the third character `j` in the string `i` is uppercase, then `s` is set to 3 and for the loop to execute a third time, `len(i)` must be greater than 2.***
