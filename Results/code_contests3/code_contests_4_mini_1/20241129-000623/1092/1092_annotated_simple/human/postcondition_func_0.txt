The function accepts an integer `n` (though it is not used in the implementation) and reads a string of single-space separated words from the input. It counts the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any word from the input string and prints that maximum count. The function does not handle cases where the input is empty or contains no uppercase letters, which could lead to misleading output since the maximum `m` will default to 0 if no uppercase letters are found.
