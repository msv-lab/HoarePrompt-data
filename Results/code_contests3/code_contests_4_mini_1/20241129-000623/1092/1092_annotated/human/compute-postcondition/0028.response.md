Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `l` and must be a string (or iterable) with at least 3 characters, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `j` is the next character in `i`, which must be the third character if `i` has at least 3 characters; if `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is updated to `s + 1`.***
