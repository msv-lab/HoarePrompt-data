The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads a line of input consisting of words, where the total length of the words is between 1 and 200 characters. It splits this input into a list of words and counts the number of uppercase letters in each word. The function then determines the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any single word and prints that maximum value. It does not handle any cases where the input does not meet the expected criteria (e.g., if the input is empty or contains invalid characters), and it assumes valid input is always provided. 

Functionality: ** The function reads a line of text input, counts the number of uppercase letters in each word, and prints the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any single word. **
