`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 1, so after the execution, `s` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l` (which is a non-empty string), `m` is 0, `s` is 2, and `j` is the second character of `i`, which is an uppercase letter if `j` is uppercase.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l` (which is a non-empty string), `m` is 0, `s` is 2, and `j` is the second character of `i`, which is an uppercase letter if `j` is uppercase.**
