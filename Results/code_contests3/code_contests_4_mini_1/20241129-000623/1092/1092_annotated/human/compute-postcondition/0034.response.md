Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `l` and is a non-empty string, `m` is updated to max(s, m) where `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in `i`, `s` is 0, and `j` is an uppercase letter.***
