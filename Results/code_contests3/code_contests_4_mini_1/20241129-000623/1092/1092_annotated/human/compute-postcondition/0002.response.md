The variable `m` is assigned the value of `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `text`, or `l`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is the input string; `l` is a list of strings derived from `text`; `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is the input string; `l` is a list of strings derived from `text`; `m` is 0**.
