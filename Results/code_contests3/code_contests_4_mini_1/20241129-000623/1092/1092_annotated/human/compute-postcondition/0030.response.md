The variable `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` and `m`. The values of `s` and `m` are both previously defined: `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in `i`, and `m` is equal to the number of uppercase letters in `i`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `m` is updated to be the larger value of the two. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is the input string; `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 2 elements; `i` is the second element in the list `l` and must be a string; `m` is updated to max(s, m), `s` is the total count of uppercase letters in `i`.**
