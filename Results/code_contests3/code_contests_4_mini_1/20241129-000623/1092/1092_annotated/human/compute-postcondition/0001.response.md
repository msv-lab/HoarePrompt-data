The variable `l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged and `text` is now represented as a list of strings in `l`. Since `text` was the input string, `l` will contain the split parts of that string. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is the input string; `l` is a list of strings derived from `text`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `text` is the input string; `l` is a list of strings derived from `text`.**
