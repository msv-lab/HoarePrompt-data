The code `print(m)` outputs the current value of `m` to the console. The variable `m` holds the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any string in the list `l`. Since no changes are made to `m` in this code snippet, its previous value remains unchanged and is printed. The other variables `n`, `text`, and `l` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text`, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any string in `l`.**
