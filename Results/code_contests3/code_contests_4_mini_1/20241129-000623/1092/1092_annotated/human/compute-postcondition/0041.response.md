The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 3 elements, `i` is a non-empty string that is the third element in the list `l`, and for the loop to execute again `i` must have more characters after `j`; variable `s` is increased by 1.
