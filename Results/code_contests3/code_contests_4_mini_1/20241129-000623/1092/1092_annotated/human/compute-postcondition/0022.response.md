Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `l` and must be a string (or iterable), `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `s` is 1, and `j` is an uppercase character if `j` is uppercase. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.***
