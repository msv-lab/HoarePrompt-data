Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 3 elements, and `i` is a non-empty string that is the third element in the list `l`. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is increased by 1. If `j` is not uppercase, the state of `s` remains unchanged.***
