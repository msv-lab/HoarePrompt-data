The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes an input text that is a single line of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters, with the total length equal to an integer `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The specifics of the output are not provided, but it can be inferred that the function likely performs some operations on the text. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a text input that adheres to the specified constraints and perform an operation based on that input.
