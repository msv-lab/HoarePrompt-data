Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `text` is the input string, `l` is a list of strings derived from `text` with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list `l` (which is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters), `m` is 0, if `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is set to 2; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
