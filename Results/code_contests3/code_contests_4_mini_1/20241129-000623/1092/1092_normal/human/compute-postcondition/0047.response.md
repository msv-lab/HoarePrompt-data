The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), and a string consisting of single-space separated words made up of small and capital Latin letters. After executing the function body, it processes the input and produces an output based on the provided parameters. 

However, since the output behavior of the function is not specified, we cannot detail the return values. Thus, we can state the parameters and acknowledge the function's purpose without defining the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 200 inclusive) and a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
