The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and previously `s` was updated to 1, so after execution, `s` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 1 or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 2, `j` is the second character of `i`, and the loop has executed a third time because `i` has at least 3 characters.
