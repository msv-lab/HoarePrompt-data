The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, and `i` is the first word in the list; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list; `s` is 0**
