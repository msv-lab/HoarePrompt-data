`m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` (the count of uppercase characters in the first word `i`) and the current value of `m`, which is 0. Since `s` is a count of uppercase characters and is between 0 and the length of `i`, the value of `m` will either remain 0 or increase to the value of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, and `j` iterates over each character of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is the count of uppercase characters in `i`, `j` iterates over each character of `i`.**
