The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially 1, after the execution, `s` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `j` is the second character of `i`, and `s` is 2.
