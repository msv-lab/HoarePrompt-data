According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string represented by variable `i`. The variable `i` is currently set to the first word in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, `i` must contain at least one character, which is guaranteed since `l` has at least one word. Therefore, `j` will iterate over the characters of that first word.

To summarize the conditions for the loop to execute:
- `l` is a list of words with at least one word.
- `i` is the first word from the list, which ensures it has at least one character.

Thus, the state adjustment for the loop to execute would be:
State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is the first character of `i`.**
