According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third word in the list `l`, and `j` iterates over each character of `i`. Since `s` is 1 and `j` is iterating over the characters in `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to the next character in the string `i`. If `i` has at least 4 characters, then the loop can execute again. 

State: **`s` is 1, `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either `s` or remains the same, `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words, `i` is the third word in the list, `j` is the next character in `i` (after the last character processed)**
