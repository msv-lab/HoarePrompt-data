`s` is incremented by 1, and since `s` was previously updated to 2, after execution `s` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 1 or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 3, and `j` is the third character of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 1 or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 3, `j` is the third character of `i`**
