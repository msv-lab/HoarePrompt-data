According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second word in the list `l`, which has at least 2 words, and it has at least 3 characters. The character `j` is the second character of `i`, and it is specified that if `j` is uppercase, the loop has executed a third time. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next character in the string `i`. Given that `i` has at least 3 characters, and `j` is currently the second character, to execute the loop again, we need to move to the next character, which means `j` will now refer to the third character of `i`.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:
- `j` will now be the third character of `i`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 1 or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is updated to 2, and `j` is the third character of `i`.**
