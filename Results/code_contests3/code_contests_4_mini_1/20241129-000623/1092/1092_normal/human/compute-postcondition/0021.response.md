`The value of s is incremented by 1, but the previous value of s is 0, so after execution, s becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is between 1 and 200, m is either s or 0, l is a list of words with at least 2 words, i is the second word in the list, s is 1, j is the first character of i, and j is an uppercase letter.`  
Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either 1 or 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 2 words, `i` is the second word in the list, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase letter.**
