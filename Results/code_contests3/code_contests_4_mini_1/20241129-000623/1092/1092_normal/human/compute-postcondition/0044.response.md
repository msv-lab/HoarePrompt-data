The variable `m` is assigned the maximum value between `s` (the count of uppercase letters in `i`) and the current value of `m`. The value of `s` is known as the count of uppercase letters in the third word `i`. However, `m` could either stay the same or be updated to the value of `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects this potential change.

Output State: **`s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`; `n` is between 1 and 200; `m` is either equal to the count of uppercase letters or remains the same; `l` is a list of words with at least 3 words; `i` is the third word in the list.**
