Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of words input by the user and returns the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any single word within that list. It does not specifically utilize the integer `n` as described in the annotations, and it does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., empty input). The function simply prints the maximum count of uppercase letters and does not return any value. **
