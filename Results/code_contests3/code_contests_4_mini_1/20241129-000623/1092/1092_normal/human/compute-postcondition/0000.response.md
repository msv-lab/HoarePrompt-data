The code `raw_input()` is a function that accepts input from the user but does not affect the existing variables. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is an integer between 1 and 200, and the string of words provided remains unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), and the second line contains a string of single-space separated words consisting only of small and capital Latin letters.**
