According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first word in the list `l`, and `j` is the second character of `i`. Since `i` is a string, if it has at least 2 characters, the loop will execute again for the next character in the string.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must become the next character in the string `i`. Given that `j` is currently the second character, `j` will become the third character in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must have at least 3 characters.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of words with at least 1 word, `i` is the first word in the list, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must have at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character of `i`.**
