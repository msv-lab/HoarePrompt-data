The provided program appears to take an integer input `a` and uses it to index into a predefined list to produce an output. However, there are several issues with the implementation regarding adherence to the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()`, which is not compatible with Python 3. The correct function should be `input()`. This is a compatibility issue but does not directly affect correctness if the program were run in Python 2.

2. **Output Logic**: The list used in the program is:
   ```
   [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```
   The problem description indicates that for an input of `3`, the expected output is `13`. Looking at the list, the value at index `3` is indeed `13`, so in this specific case, it appears to be correct.

3. **General Case Evaluation**: To ensure the program is correct, we need to check all possible inputs from `0` to `15` (as per the problem description). The outputs for each input are as follows:
   - Input `0`: Output `15`
   - Input `1`: Output `14`
   - Input `2`: Output `12`
   - Input `3`: Output `13`
   - Input `4`: Output `8`
   - Input `5`: Output `9`
   - Input `6`: Output `10`
   - Input `7`: Output `11`
   - Input `8`: Output `0`
   - Input `9`: Output `1`
   - Input `10`: Output `2`
   - Input `11`: Output `3`
   - Input `12`: Output `4`
   - Input `13`: Output `5`
   - Input `14`: Output `6`
   - Input `15`: Output `7`

4. **Missing Output for Cases**: The problem states that the input is a single integer `a` where `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`. The program does not handle cases where the index is out of the specified range. For example, if given an input greater than `15` or less than `0`, it would raise an `IndexError`, which is not acceptable according to the problem description.

In conclusion, the program does not correctly handle all specified inputs, particularly those on the boundaries and beyond the given range. Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
