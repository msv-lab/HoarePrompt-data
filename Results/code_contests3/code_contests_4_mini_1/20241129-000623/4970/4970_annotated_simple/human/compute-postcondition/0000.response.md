The code snippet uses `raw_input()` to accept an input and then converts it to an integer with `int()`. This integer is used as an index to access the list `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Since `a` is defined as a non-negative integer such that `0 <= a <= 15`, the output will depend on the value of `a` that is provided through `raw_input()`. 

The list has 16 elements, so valid indices are from 0 to 15. Each possible value of `a` corresponds to a specific value in the list:

- If `a` is 0, the output is 15.
- If `a` is 1, the output is 14.
- If `a` is 2, the output is 12.
- If `a` is 3, the output is 13.
- If `a` is 4, the output is 8.
- If `a` is 5, the output is 9.
- If `a` is 6, the output is 10.
- If `a` is 7, the output is 11.
- If `a` is 8, the output is 0.
- If `a` is 9, the output is 1.
- If `a` is 10, the output is 2.
- If `a` is 11, the output is 3.
- If `a` is 12, the output is 4.
- If `a` is 13, the output is 5.
- If `a` is 14, the output is 6.
- If `a` is 15, the output is 7.

Since the specific value of `a` is not provided, we will state the output as dependent on the input. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `a` <= 15; the output will be the value from the list at index `a`.**
