The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq 15\). However, there is no further output or return value detailed in the provided information. Without specific output conditions, we cannot determine a return value or functionality based on the parameter constraint alone.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified.**
