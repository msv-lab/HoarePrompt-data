Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the input as required by the problem description. According to the example, when the input is `3`, the expected output is `13`. 

The program uses a list of integers to map input values between `0` and `15` to specific outputs. However, the arrangement of the list does not correspond correctly to the expected outputs based on the provided example or the reasoning behind it. 

If we analyze the list:
```python
[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

- When the input is `0`, the output is `15`.
- When the input is `1`, the output is `14`.
- When the input is `2`, the output is `12`.
- When the input is `3`, the output is `13`.

This part works correctly as per the example. However, if we test other inputs:

- When the input is `4`, the output is `8`.
- When the input is `5`, the output is `9`.
- When the input is `6`, the output is `10`.
- When the input is `7`, the output is `11`.
- When the input is `8`, the output is `0`.
- When the input is `9`, the output is `1`.
- When the input is `10`, the output is `2`.
- When the input is `11`, the output is `3`.
- When the input is `12`, the output is `4`.
- When the input is `13`, the output is `5`.
- When the input is `14`, the output is `6`.
- When the input is `15`, the output is `7`.

There is no clear logic that maps the inputs to outputs as one would expect from the problem description, particularly since the example only provides a single input-output mapping without a clear pattern beyond `3` to `13`. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements as described for all potential inputs and does not provide a coherent transformation for inputs `4` to `15` in relation to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.
