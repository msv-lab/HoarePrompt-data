The function `func` takes no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer value. This input is used as an index to access an element from a predefined list of integers. The list contains 16 elements, and valid indices range from 0 to 15. If the user inputs an integer within this range, it will print the corresponding element from the list. However, if the user inputs a value outside of this range, the function will raise an `IndexError`, as there is no error handling implemented for out-of-bounds indices. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the selected element.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input from the user, uses it as an index to access an element from a fixed list of integers, and prints the element. If the input is outside the range of 0 to 15, it will raise an IndexError. **
