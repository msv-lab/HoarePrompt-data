The function `func` accepts a parameter `a`. `a` is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15. However, since the output is not provided, we cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function based on the input parameter. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `a` within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is an integer such that 0 <= a <= 15. The return value is not specified.**
