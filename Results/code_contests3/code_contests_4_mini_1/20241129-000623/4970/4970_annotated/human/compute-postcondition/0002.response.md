Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and prints an element from a predefined list based on user input. The input should be a non-negative integer that indicates the index of the list, which ranges from 0 to 15. If the user inputs an integer outside this range, an IndexError will occur as the list only contains 16 elements (indexed from 0 to 15). **
