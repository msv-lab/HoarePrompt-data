The given problem description specifies that the program must take a single integer input \( a \) (where \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \)) and output a single integer. 

The annotated program defines a function `func()` which:
1. Reads input from the user using `raw_input()`.
2. Uses the input as an index to access a predefined list of integers.
3. Prints the integer found at that index.

The predefined list is:
```
[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
This list has 16 elements, indexed from 0 to 15, which matches the input constraints provided in the problem description.

### Verification of the program:

1. **Input Range**: The program is designed to accept input only in the range of \( 0 \) to \( 15 \). The comment states that if the input is outside this range, an `IndexError` will occur. However, the problem description explicitly states that the input will always be a non-negative integer in the range \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \).

2. **Output**: For every valid input \( a \) within the specified range, the program will output the corresponding value from the list, which is guaranteed to be an integer. 

3. **Function Behavior**: The function does not take any parameters and relies on user input. The program correctly prints an integer based on the defined list. 

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly handles inputs in the specified range and outputs the corresponding integer, it adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
