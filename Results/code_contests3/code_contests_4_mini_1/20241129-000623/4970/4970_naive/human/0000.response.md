To determine the correctness of the given program based on the provided problem description, we need to analyze the input and output requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Input: A single integer \( a \) where \( 0 \leq a \leq 15 \).
- Output: A single integer based on the input.

### Program Analysis:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```
1. The program uses a list of integers: `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
2. It retrieves the input using `raw_input()` and converts it to an integer.
3. The program directly accesses the index of the list using the input integer.

### Validating the Output:
- The input \( a \) can take values from 0 to 15.
- The list has 16 elements, indexed from 0 to 15, which matches the valid range of \( a \).

### Checking Each Case:
- For \( a = 0 \), it outputs `15`.
- For \( a = 1 \), it outputs `14`.
- For \( a = 2 \), it outputs `12`.
- For \( a = 3 \), it outputs `13`.
- For \( a = 4 \), it outputs `8`.
- For \( a = 5 \), it outputs `9`.
- For \( a = 6 \), it outputs `10`.
- For \( a = 7 \), it outputs `11`.
- For \( a = 8 \), it outputs `0`.
- For \( a = 9 \), it outputs `1`.
- For \( a = 10 \), it outputs `2`.
- For \( a = 11 \), it outputs `3`.
- For \( a = 12 \), it outputs `4`.
- For \( a = 13 \), it outputs `5`.
- For \( a = 14 \), it outputs `6`.
- For \( a = 15 \), it outputs `7`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all potential inputs as defined by the problem description. Each input from 0 to 15 corresponds to a valid output from the list. There are no edge cases or errors in logic that would cause the program to fail for any of the specified inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
