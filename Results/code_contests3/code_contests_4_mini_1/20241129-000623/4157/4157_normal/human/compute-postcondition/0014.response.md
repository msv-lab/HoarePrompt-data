Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, and `t` remains unchanged; `t1` is calculated based on the formula involving `v`, `a`, and `d` under the condition that `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, or it is the square root of `2 * d / a`.**
