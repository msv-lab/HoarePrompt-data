Functionality: ** The function accepts parameters `n` (number of trolleybuses), `a` (maximum acceleration), and `d` (distance to the final station). For each trolleybus, it also accepts `ti` (departure time) and `vi` (maximum speed). The function calculates the maximum time taken for all trolleybuses to reach the final station based on their speed, acceleration, and departure times. It prints the maximum time for each trolleybus as it processes them. The function does not handle cases where the calculation might result in invalid scenarios (e.g., if `d` is less than or equal to `0`, which is theoretically outside the stated constraints).**
