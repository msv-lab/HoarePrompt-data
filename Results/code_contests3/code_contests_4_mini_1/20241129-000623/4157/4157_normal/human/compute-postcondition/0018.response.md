The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, with the constraint that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a`: a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, with the constraint that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^6\).
- `d`: a positive integer representing the distance to the final station, with the constraint that \(1 \leq d \leq 10^6\).
- For each trolleybus `i`, the parameters are:
  - `ti`: a non-negative integer representing the time it leaves the depot, with the constraint that \(0 \leq ti \leq 10^6\).
  - `vi`: a positive integer representing its maximum speed, with the constraint that \(1 \leq vi \leq 10^6\).
  - Additionally, it is specified that \(0 \leq t1 < t2 < ... < tn \leq 10^6\), ensuring the departure times are in increasing order.

The function does not return a specific value in the provided output description, so the return behavior is not explicitly stated.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, `d`, and for each trolleybus `i`, the parameters `ti` and `vi`, representing various characteristics of trolleybuses and their journeys.**
