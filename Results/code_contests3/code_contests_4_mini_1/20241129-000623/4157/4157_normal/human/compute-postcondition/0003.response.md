The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input and splits it into two parts that are then converted to floats using `map(float, ...)`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code. The output state will reflect the new variables introduced by the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input**
