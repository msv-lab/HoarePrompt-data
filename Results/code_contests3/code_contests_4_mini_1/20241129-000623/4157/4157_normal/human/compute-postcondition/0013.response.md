The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned from the input, where the input is split into two parts and each part is converted to a float. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the previous values of `ti` and `v` are not known, but they are now updated based on the input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, `t` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ti` is an input float, `v` is an input float, `t` remains unchanged, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
