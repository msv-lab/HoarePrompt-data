The variables `ti` and `v` are assigned values from the input, which is read as a string and split into two parts. The `map(float, ...)` function converts these string values into floats. The previous values of `ti` and `v` are not known since they are being updated from input. Other variables are not affected by this line, and `t` remains unchanged at this point as it is not updated or printed in this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, and `t` remains unchanged (the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value is not calculated yet).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ti` is a float from input, `v` is a float from input, `t` remains unchanged.**
