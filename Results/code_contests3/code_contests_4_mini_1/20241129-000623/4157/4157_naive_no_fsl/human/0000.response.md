Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where one trolleybus catches up to another. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where a trolleybus that leaves later (with a higher speed) catches up to an earlier trolleybus. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 10 100
0 10
1 20
```

In this case:
- The first trolleybus leaves at time `0` with a maximum speed of `10 m/s`.
- The second trolleybus leaves at time `1` with a maximum speed of `20 m/s`.

According to basic physics, the first trolleybus will take `20` seconds to reach the final station (it will reach the distance of `100 m` at `t = 20` seconds). The second trolleybus, with its higher speed, will take `10` seconds to reach the final station (it will reach the distance of `100 m` at `t = 11` seconds). 

However, the second trolleybus will catch up with the first trolleybus before reaching the station, as the first trolleybus is still moving at `10 m/s` when the second trolleybus reaches it. Therefore, both trolleybuses should arrive together at the final station.

The program does not implement the logic to detect when the second trolleybus catches up to the first one and does not adjust their arrival times accordingly. As a result, it will output incorrect arrival times for the trolleybuses, leading to an incorrect solution.

Thus, since the program does not correctly account for the catch-up scenario, it is incorrect.
