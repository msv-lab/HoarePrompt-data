You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In some country live wizards. They love to ride trolleybuses.

A city in this country has a trolleybus depot with n trolleybuses. Every day the trolleybuses leave the depot, one by one and go to the final station. The final station is at a distance of d meters from the depot. We know for the i-th trolleybus that it leaves at the moment of time ti seconds, can go at a speed of no greater than vi meters per second, and accelerate with an acceleration no greater than a meters per second squared. A trolleybus can decelerate as quickly as you want (magic!). It can change its acceleration as fast as you want, as well. Note that the maximum acceleration is the same for all trolleys.

Despite the magic the trolleys are still powered by an electric circuit and cannot overtake each other (the wires are to blame, of course). If a trolleybus catches up with another one, they go together one right after the other until they arrive at the final station. Also, the drivers are driving so as to arrive at the final station as quickly as possible.

You, as head of the trolleybuses' fans' club, are to determine for each trolley the minimum time by which it can reach the final station. At the time of arrival at the destination station the trolleybus does not necessarily have zero speed. When a trolley is leaving the depot, its speed is considered equal to zero. From the point of view of physics, the trolleybuses can be considered as material points, and also we should ignore the impact on the speed of a trolley bus by everything, except for the acceleration and deceleration provided by the engine.

Input

The first input line contains three space-separated integers n, a, d (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a, d ≤ 106) — the number of trolleybuses, their maximum acceleration and the distance from the depot to the final station, correspondingly.

Next n lines contain pairs of integers ti vi (0 ≤ t1 < t2... < tn - 1 < tn ≤ 106, 1 ≤ vi ≤ 106) — the time when the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot and its maximum speed, correspondingly. The numbers in the lines are separated by spaces.

Output

For each trolleybus print a single line the time it arrives to the final station. Print the times for the trolleybuses in the order in which the trolleybuses are given in the input. The answer will be accepted if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 4.

Examples

Input

3 10 10000
0 10
5 11
1000 1


Output

1000.5000000000
1000.5000000000
11000.0500000000


Input

1 2 26
28 29


Output

33.0990195136

Note

In the first sample the second trolleybus will catch up with the first one, that will happen at distance 510.5 meters from the depot. The trolleybuses will go the remaining 9489.5 meters together at speed 10 meters per second. As a result, both trolleybuses will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 1000.5 seconds. The third trolleybus will not catch up with them. It will arrive to the final station by the moment of time 11000.05 seconds.
Program:
```
t = 0.0
(n, a, d) = map(int, raw_input().split())
for i in xrange(n):
    (ti, v) = map(float, raw_input().split())
    t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
    t = max(t1 + ti, t)
    print(t)
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
