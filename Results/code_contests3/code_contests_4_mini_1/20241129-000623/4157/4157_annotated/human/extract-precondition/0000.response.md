Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and for each trolleybus i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) is the time when it leaves the depot and vi (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6) is its maximum speed, with the condition that 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < ... < tn.**
