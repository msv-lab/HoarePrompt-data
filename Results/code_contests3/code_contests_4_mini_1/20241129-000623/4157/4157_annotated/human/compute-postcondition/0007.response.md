According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop can execute again. After each iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be increased to 1, and since `n` is still greater than 0, it allows for another iteration.

State: **`t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
