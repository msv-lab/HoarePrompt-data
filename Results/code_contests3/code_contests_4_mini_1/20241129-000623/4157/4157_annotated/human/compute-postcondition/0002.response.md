According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, since the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 1`. The variable `t` is initialized to 0.0, which does not affect the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and the variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is 0.0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0**
