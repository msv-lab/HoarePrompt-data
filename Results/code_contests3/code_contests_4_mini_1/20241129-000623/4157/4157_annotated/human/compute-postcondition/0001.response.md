The values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input()`, which is split into separate values and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code.

Since `n`, `a`, and `d` are derived from user input, their specific values are unknown, and we cannot determine the exact output state for these variables without actual input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` remains 0.0 and `n`, `a`, and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`t` is 0.0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
