According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, it allows for at least one more iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is the maximum of `t1 + ti` and `t`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
