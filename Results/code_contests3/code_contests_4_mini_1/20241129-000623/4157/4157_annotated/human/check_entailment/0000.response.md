The program provided does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key reasons why the program is incorrect:

1. **Calculation of Arrival Time**: The logic for calculating the time taken for each trolleybus to reach the final station is flawed. The formula used in the program does not account for the case when a trolleybus has to catch up with another trolleybus. According to the problem, if a trolleybus catches up with another, they travel together, which is not addressed in the current implementation. 

2. **Handling of Catch-Up**: The program fails to implement the necessary logic to determine if a trolleybus will catch up with a previous one. The problem states that if a trolleybus catches another, they will travel together at the speed of the faster trolleybus. This is not reflected in the calculation of the maximum arrival time.

3. **Final Output**: The program only prints the maximum arrival time across all trolleybuses rather than calculating and printing the individual arrival times for each trolleybus as required by the problem description.

4. **Incorrect Use of Variables**: The variable `t` is incorrectly used to track the maximum arrival time. The program should maintain a list of individual arrival times, rather than just calculating a maximum value.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
