The function accepts integers representing the number of trolleybuses `n`, maximum acceleration `a`, and distance `d` to the station. For each trolleybus, it takes non-negative departure time `ti` and positive maximum speed `vi`. The function calculates the time `t` when each trolleybus reaches the station based on its acceleration and speed, and prints the maximum time taken for all trolleybuses to arrive at the station. It does not return any value; instead, it outputs the arrival times directly. Additionally, it assumes valid input as per the specified constraints.
