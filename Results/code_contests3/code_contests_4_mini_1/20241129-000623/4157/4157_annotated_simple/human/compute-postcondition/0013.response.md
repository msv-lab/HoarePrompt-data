The line of code takes input from the user and splits it into two values, which are then converted to floats and assigned to `ti` and `v`. Since the initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2, the values of `ti` and `v` will depend on the user's input and are not predetermined. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `ti` and `v` are inputs as floats.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `ti` and `v` are inputs as floats**
