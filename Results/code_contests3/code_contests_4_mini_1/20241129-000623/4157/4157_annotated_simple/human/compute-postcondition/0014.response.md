To simulate the execution of the provided Python code, we need to analyze the assignment of `t1` based on the conditions given.

1. The code is assigning a value to `t1` based on a conditional expression that involves the variable `d` and the expression `v * v / (2 * a)`.

2. The condition checks whether `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`. However, the values of `d` and `a` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine which branch of the conditional statement will be executed.

3. If `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` will be assigned the value of `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. If `d` is not greater, then `t1` will be assigned the value of `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

4. Since we do not have specific values for `d` and `a`, we cannot calculate a specific numeric result for `t1`.

5. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t1` depends on the unspecified values of `d` and `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `t1` depends on the values of `d` and `a`.**
