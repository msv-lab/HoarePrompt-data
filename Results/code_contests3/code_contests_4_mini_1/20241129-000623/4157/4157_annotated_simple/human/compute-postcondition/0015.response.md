To evaluate the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line `t = max(t1 + ti, t)`.

1. **Variable Analysis**:
   - `t1` depends on `d` and `a`, but we do not have specific values for `d`, `a`, or `t1`.
   - `ti` is not defined in the initial state or affected by the code snippet. We do not know its value.
   - `t` is a variable that is being updated.

2. **Operation**:
   - The operation takes the maximum of two values: `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.

3. **State After Execution**:
   - Since `t1` and `ti` are not specified, we cannot calculate their sum explicitly. However, we know that `t` will be assigned the maximum of these two values.
   - The initial state of `n` and `i` is unaffected by this operation, as they do not appear in the equation.

Therefore, the output will reflect that `t` is updated based on the maximum function, but we cannot specify exact values for `t1`, `ti`, or `t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `t` is updated to max(t1 + ti, t)**
