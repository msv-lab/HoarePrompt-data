Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is an integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is an integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), and for each trolleybus, `ti` is a non-negative integer representing the time when it leaves the depot (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and `vi` is a positive integer representing its maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6); `t` is assigned the value 0.0.**
