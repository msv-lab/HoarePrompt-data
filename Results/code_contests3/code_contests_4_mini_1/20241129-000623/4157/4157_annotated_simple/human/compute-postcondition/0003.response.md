`ti` and `v` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which takes input as a string, splits it into components, and converts them to floats using `map(float, ...)`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not affected. The output state will reflect that `ti` and `v` are now floating-point numbers based on the user input. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float**
