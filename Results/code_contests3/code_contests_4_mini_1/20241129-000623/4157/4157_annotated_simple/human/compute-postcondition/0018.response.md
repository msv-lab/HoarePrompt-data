The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: an integer representing the number of trolleybuses, where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a`: an integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, where \(1 \leq a \leq 10^6\).
- `d`: an integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station, where \(1 \leq d \leq 10^6\).
- For each trolleybus, two parameters are considered:
  - `ti`: a non-negative integer representing the time when the trolleybus leaves the depot, where \(0 \leq ti \leq 10^6\) and the times \(t1, t2, ..., tn\) are in strictly increasing order.
  - `vi`: a positive integer representing its maximum speed, where \(1 \leq vi \leq 10^6\).

After executing the function body, the output is determined by the calculations involving these parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters related to trolleybuses, including their number, acceleration, distance, departure times, and speeds, and return a result based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters representing the number of trolleybuses, maximum acceleration, distance to the station, and for each trolleybus, the departure time and maximum speed, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
