To evaluate the code, we first note that `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. However, we don't have specific values for `d` and `a` in the initial state, only that `n` is greater than 0, and `i`, `ti`, and `v` are floats. The calculation for `t1` will depend on the condition involving `d` and `v`.

1. If `d > v * v / (2 * a)`, then:
   - `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.

2. If `d <= v * v / (2 * a)`, then:
   - `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since we do not have specific values for `d` and `a`, we cannot determine which branch of the conditional statement will execute or the exact value of `t1`. Thus, the variables `n`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` remain unchanged in value, and we cannot specify what `t1` will be without knowing `d` and `a`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the operation defining `t1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ti` is a float, `v` is a float, and `t1` is calculated based on the condition involving `d` and `a`.**
