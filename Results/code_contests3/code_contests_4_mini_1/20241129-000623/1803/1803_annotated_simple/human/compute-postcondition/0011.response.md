The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but after this operation, `k` will be 3 units greater than its previous value. The state of `Arreglo` remains unchanged as it was already updated to include the element `Cadena[k]`. The condition for the loop to execute again remains dependent on the new value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` includes the element `Cadena[k]`, `k` is now `previous k + 3`, and `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k + 3` for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`Arreglo` includes the element `Cadena[k]`, `k` is now `previous k + 3`, and `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k + 3` for the loop to execute again.**
