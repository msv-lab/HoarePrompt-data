The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but the loop condition states that it will continue if `len(Cadena)` is greater than the new value of `k`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `k` has been updated by adding 3. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include the element `Cadena[k]`, and `k` is increased by 3**
