Functionality: ** The function accepts a formatted string of lowercase letters contained within curly brackets, extracts every third character starting from the first character after the opening bracket, and prints the number of unique characters from that extracted set. If the input string does not contain more than 2 characters, it will not extract any characters, resulting in a count of zero unique characters.**
