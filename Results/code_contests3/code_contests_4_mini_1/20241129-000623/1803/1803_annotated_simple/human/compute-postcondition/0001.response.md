The code initializes an empty list `Arreglo`. The previous state of the variable `Cadena` is not modified by this line of code, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{', ends with '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by a comma and a space; `Arreglo` is an empty list.**
