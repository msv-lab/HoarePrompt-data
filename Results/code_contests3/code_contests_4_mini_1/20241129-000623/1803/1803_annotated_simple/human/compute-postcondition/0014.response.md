The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes an input string that starts with an opening curly bracket '{', ends with a closing curly bracket '}', and contains lowercase English letters separated by a comma and a space. The length of the string does not exceed 1000 characters. The function likely performs some operations on the contents of this string but does not specify any output. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a formatted string of lowercase letters within curly brackets for processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts a formatted string of lowercase letters within curly brackets for processing.**
