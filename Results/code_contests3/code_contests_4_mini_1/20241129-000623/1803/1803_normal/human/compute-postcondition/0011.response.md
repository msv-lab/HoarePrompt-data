The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` was increased to include `Cadena[k]`, its previous value can be determined, but only its new value is affected by the code. The state of `Arreglo` remains unchanged in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, `k` is increased by 3, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, `k` is increased by 3, and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.**
