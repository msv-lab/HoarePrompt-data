The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating it with a list containing the element at index `k` of `Cadena`. Since `k` is 4, the element `Cadena[4]` is added to `Arreglo`. The previous state indicates that `Arreglo` contains `Cadena[1]`, but the actual content of `Cadena` is not specified. Therefore, we can only describe the change in terms of its structure.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]` is appended to `Arreglo`**.
