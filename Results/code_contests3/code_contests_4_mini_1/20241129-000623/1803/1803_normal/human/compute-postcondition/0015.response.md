Functionality: ** The function accepts a string formatted as '{letter1, letter2, ...}' representing a set of small English letters. It extracts characters from this string at positions 1, 4, 7, etc., until it exceeds the length of the string. It then calculates and prints the number of unique letters extracted. The function does not validate the input format or handle any potential errors that may arise from invalid input. **
