To analyze the provided code snippet, we note the following:

- `Arreglo` is initially an empty list.
- `k` is 1.
- The code suggests that `Cadena` is a variable, but its value is not provided. However, for the loop to execute for the first time, we know `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 2.

The line of code `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` means that we are attempting to append the element at index `k` from the list or string `Cadena` to the list `Arreglo`.

Since `Arreglo` is an empty list initially, and assuming `Cadena` is defined such that it has at least 2 elements (to satisfy the condition of the loop execution), the operation will append `Cadena[1]` to `Arreglo`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `Arreglo` now contains a single element, which is `Cadena[1]`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains `Cadena[1]`, `k` is 1**
