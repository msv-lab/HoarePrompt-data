The variable `k` is incremented by 3. However, the initial value of `k` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `k`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, and `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, and `k` is increased by 3**
