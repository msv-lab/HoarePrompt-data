The value of `k` is increased by 3, which affects the index used in `Cadena`. Since `Arreglo` already contains `Cadena[1]` and `Cadena[4]`, we need to determine the new value of `k` and check if the loop condition (`len(Cadena) > 4`) holds true. 

Assuming `k` was some initial value before being increased by 3, now `k` will be `k + 3`. The new index `k` will be used to access `Cadena[k]`. If `len(Cadena)` is indeed greater than 4, the value `Cadena[k]` will be appended to `Arreglo`. 

Since we don't know the exact initial value of `k` or the content of `Cadena`, we cannot determine the exact value of `Arreglo` after execution. However, we can state the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is updated to include `Cadena[k]`, where `k` is increased by 3 and `len(Cadena)` is greater than 4.**
