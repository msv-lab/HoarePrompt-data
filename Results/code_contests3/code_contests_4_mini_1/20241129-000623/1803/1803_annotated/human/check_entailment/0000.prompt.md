You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently, Anton has found a set. The set consists of small English letters. Anton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, separated by a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the line and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line. 

Unfortunately, from time to time Anton would forget writing some letter and write it again. He asks you to count the total number of distinct letters in his set.

Input

The first and the single line contains the set of letters. The length of the line doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that the line starts from an opening curved bracket and ends with a closing curved bracket. Between them, small English letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a space.

Output

Print a single number â€” the number of distinct letters in Anton's set.

Examples

Input

{a, b, c}


Output

3


Input

{b, a, b, a}


Output

2


Input

{}


Output

0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string that represents a set of small English letters, starting with '{' and ending with '}', with letters separated by ', '. The length of the input string does not exceed 1000 characters.
def func():
    Cadena = raw_input()
    Arreglo = []
    k = 1
    while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
        Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
        
        k = k + 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'Cadena' is a string of the format '{a, b}', 'Arreglo' contains elements from 'Cadena' at indices 1, 4, 7, ..., and 'k' is greater than or equal to len(Cadena).
    print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string input formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly braces (e.g., '{a, b}'). It extracts the letters at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., from the input string, counts the number of unique letters, and prints that count. The function does not return any value, and it assumes the input is well-formed according to the specified format. If the input does not follow this format or is empty, the function may not behave as expected.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
