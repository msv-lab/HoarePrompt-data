The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `k` is 1, the new value of `k` will be 4. The other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string of the format '{a, b}', `Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string of the format '{a, b}', `Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
