According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `Cadena`. The loop will execute if the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` (which is 1) and also greater than 2. Right before the loop, `Cadena` is an input string that starts with '{' and ends with '}', with letters separated by ', '. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `Cadena` must have a length greater than 2. Since `k` is 1, if `Cadena` contains at least two letters (in addition to the '{' and '}' characters), the conditions will be satisfied. Hence, for the loop to execute, `Cadena` must consist of at least 2 letters (e.g., "{a, b}"). 

Thus, the requirement is that `Cadena` needs to be modified to have a length greater than 2. 

State: **`Cadena` is a string of the format '{a, b}', `Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `Cadena` must have a length greater than 2**
