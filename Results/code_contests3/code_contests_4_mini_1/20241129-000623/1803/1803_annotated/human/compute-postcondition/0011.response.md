The value of `k` is increased by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but it will now hold a new value that is 3 greater than its previous state. The variable `Arreglo` remains unaffected by this operation, as it has already been updated to include `Cadena[k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` has been updated to include the character `,`, `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Arreglo` has been updated to include the character `,`, `k` is increased by 3.**
