To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `Cadena` is a string of the format '{a, b}'.
   - `Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`. Assuming `Cadena` is formatted correctly, `Arreglo` would be a list containing the second element in the string `Cadena`.
   - `k` is 4.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The line `Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]` means we are attempting to access the character at index 4 of the string `Cadena`.
   - Since `Cadena` is a string, accessing `Cadena[4]` will yield the character at that position. We need to ensure that `Cadena` has enough length to access index 4.

3. **Length of `Cadena`:**
   - If `Cadena` is strictly in the format '{a, b}', it only has 7 characters (index 0 to 6).
   - Thus, `Cadena[4]` will correspond to the 5th character in the string, which is `,` (the comma).

4. **Updating `Arreglo`:**
   - `Arreglo` is updated to include the character at index 4 of `Cadena`, which we found to be `,`.
   - Therefore, `Arreglo` will now be its previous value plus a new list containing `,`.

5. **Output State:**
   - We do not have the specific previous content of `Arreglo`, so we cannot provide an exact final state for it.
   - However, we can denote that `Arreglo` has been updated to include the character `,`.

Putting this all together, the output state reflecting these changes will be:

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string of the format '{a, b}', `Arreglo` is updated to include the character ',', `k` is 4**
