The code assigns a new value to `Arreglo` by concatenating it with a list containing the element `Cadena[k]`. Given that `k` is 1, the code accesses the second element of `Cadena`. Therefore, `Arreglo` now contains one element extracted from `Cadena`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string of the format '{a, b}', `Arreglo` contains the element at index 1 of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
