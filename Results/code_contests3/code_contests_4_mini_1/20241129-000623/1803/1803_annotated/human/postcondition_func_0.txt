The function accepts a string input formatted as a set of lowercase English letters enclosed in curly braces (e.g., '{a, b}'). It extracts the letters at indices 1, 4, 7, etc., from the input string, counts the number of unique letters, and prints that count. The function does not return any value, and it assumes the input is well-formed according to the specified format. If the input does not follow this format or is empty, the function may not behave as expected.
