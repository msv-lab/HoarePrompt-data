To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, let's analyze both:

### Problem Description Summary:
1. The input is a single integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)).
2. The output must be two integers \( m \) and \( k \) such that \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) form a Pythagorean triple.
3. If no such integers exist, output -1.
4. The integers must satisfy the properties of forming a right triangle according to the Pythagorean theorem.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \( n \).
2. **Condition for Output -1**: If \( n \leq 2 \), the program correctly outputs -1, as there are no valid Pythagorean triples involving sides of length 1 or 2.
3. **Odd Case**: For odd \( n \):
   - The program calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - These values satisfy the properties of a Pythagorean triple because for an odd \( n \) (let's say \( n = 2p + 1 \)), we have:
     - \( n^2 + k^2 = m^2 \) holds true, thus forming a valid right triangle.
4. **Even Case**: For even \( n \):
   - The program calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
   - Again, these values satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, as \( n^2 + m^2 = k^2 \) holds true, ensuring a valid right triangle.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the minimum input of 1 and 2 by returning -1.
- For larger values of \( n \), both odd and even cases result in valid outputs for Pythagorean triples.

### Conclusion:
Since the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all possible inputs within the defined constraints, we can conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
