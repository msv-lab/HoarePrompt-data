Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is larger than 2. If `n` is an odd integer, the first value is calculated as (n * n - 1) / 2 and the second value as (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is an even integer, the expressions result in `k^2 - 1` and `k^2 + 1`, where `k` is equal to `n / 2`.***
