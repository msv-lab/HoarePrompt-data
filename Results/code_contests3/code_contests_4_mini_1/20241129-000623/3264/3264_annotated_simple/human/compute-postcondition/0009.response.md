Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, -1 is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 2, if `n` is odd, the first value is calculated as (n * n - 1) / 2 and the second value as (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is even, the expressions result in `k^2 - 1` and `k^2 + 1`, where `k` is equal to `n / 2`.***
