The expression calculates two values based on the variable `n`. The first value is `(n * n - 1) / 2`, and the second value is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

Given that `n` is an odd integer larger than 2, we can denote `n` as some odd integer (for example, 3, 5, 7, ..., up to 10^9). The calculations will yield two results:

1. `n * n - 1` will result in an even number, and dividing this by 2 will give us an integer. 
2. `n * n + 1` will also result in an even number, and dividing this by 2 will also give us an integer.

Thus, the output state reflects that `n` is an odd integer, resulting in two calculated values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer larger than 2; the first value is (n * n - 1) / 2, the second value is (n * n + 1) / 2.**
