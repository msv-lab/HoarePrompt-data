To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description regarding Pythagorean triples.

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the length of one side of a right triangle.

2. **Logic for n <= 2**: 
   - The program checks if `n <= 2`. If true, it prints `-1`. This is correct because there are no Pythagorean triples with sides less than or equal to 2.

3. **Handling Odd n**:
   - For odd values of `n`, the program calculates:
     ```
     (n * n - 1) / 2
     (n * n + 1) / 2
     ```
   - This is correct because the formula for generating a Pythagorean triple when one leg (cathetus) is odd is valid. The generated numbers are guaranteed to be integers as `n^2 - 1` and `n^2 + 1` are both even.

4. **Handling Even n**:
   - For even values of `n`, the program calculates:
     ```
     (n * n / 4 - 1)
     (n * n / 4 + 1)
     ```
   - This is also correct because for even `n`, we can use the formula for generating Pythagorean triples. Here, `n^2 / 4` is guaranteed to be an integer since `n` is even.

### Potential Cases

1. **Case n = 1**: 
   - Expected output: `-1` (since there are no Pythagorean triples).
   - The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.

2. **Case n = 2**: 
   - Expected output: `-1` (since there are no Pythagorean triples).
   - The program outputs `-1`, which is correct.

3. **Case n = 3**: 
   - Expected output: `4 5`, which is valid.
   - The program calculates and prints the values correctly.

4. **Case n = 4**: 
   - Expected output: `3 5`, which is valid.
   - The program calculates and prints the values correctly.

5. **Case n = 6**: 
   - Expected output: `8 10`, which is valid.
   - The program calculates and prints the values correctly.

6. **Case n = 17**: 
   - Expected output: `144 145`, which is valid.
   - The program calculates and prints the values correctly.

7. **Case n = 67**: 
   - Expected output: `2244 2245`, which is valid.
   - The program calculates and prints the values correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and verifying against all relevant cases, the program correctly implements the Pythagorean triple generation as described in the problem. There are no cases where the program fails to provide the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
