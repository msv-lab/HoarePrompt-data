Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description and the output hints.

**Problem Description Summary:**
The task is to find two integers `m` and `k` such that `n`, `m`, and `k` form a Pythagorean triple, based on the input integer `n`. The code should return `-1` if no such triple exists.

**Program Provided:**
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

**Output Hints Summary:**
1. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`.
3. If `n` is even and greater than 2, it prints `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`.

**Initial Assessment of Code:**
1. The condition `if n <= 2:` correctly identifies that no Pythagorean triple can be formed with `n` values of 1 or 2, hence returning `-1`.
2. For odd `n` (where `n > 2`), the outputs `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2` seem to generate valid Pythagorean triples as per the pattern for odd integers.
3. For even `n` (where `n > 2`), the outputs `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)` also follow the correct pattern for generating Pythagorean triples.

**Edge Cases:**
- The code seems to work for odd and even values of `n` greater than 2, as shown in the examples.
- However, the division operations `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2` (as well as the even case) will yield floating-point numbers, as Python 2's division operator `/` performs integer division in some scenarios. For proper integer outputs, it should use `//` for integer division.
- The program does not handle potential input errors or ensure that the input is indeed a positive integer (though the problem guarantees this).

**Output Hints Verification:**
The output hints are consistent with the code's logic for generating the appropriate outputs for both odd and even integers. 

**Conclusion:**
While the main logic seems correct for generating Pythagorean triples for valid inputs of `n`, the division may not yield integer results due to the use of `/` instead of `//`. This means it does not handle all cases correctly, particularly the requirement for integer outputs.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
