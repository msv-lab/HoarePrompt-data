Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is in the range 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, a syntax error occurs during execution. If `n` is larger than 2, and if `n` is odd, the results are 4 and 5. If `n` is even, the first expression evaluates to `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression evaluates to `n * n / 4 + 1.***
