The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate within the constraints where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, the output behavior of the function has not been provided. Therefore, without further information regarding the output or how the function processes the input, we cannot define its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output behavior is not specified.**
