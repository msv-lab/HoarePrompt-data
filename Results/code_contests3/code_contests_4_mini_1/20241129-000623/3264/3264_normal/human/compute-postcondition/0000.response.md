The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9, the output state will reflect that `n` has been updated to the value provided by the input. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
