The expression `print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1` consists of two parts. The first part calculates `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second part calculates `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can denote `n` as any of its valid values (for calculation purposes, we can consider specific examples if needed, but we'll keep it general for this output).

1. The calculation `n * n / 4` will yield an integer since `n` is even. Denote this result as `m`, where `m = n * n / 4`.
2. The first expression `m - 1` will give `m - 1`.
3. The second expression `m + 1` will give `m + 1`.

So both expressions are valid and can be computed from the value of `n`. The output state includes the calculated results based on `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, `n` is an even integer; the first expression evaluates to `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression evaluates to `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, `n` is an even integer; the first expression evaluates to `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second expression evaluates to `n * n / 4 + 1.**
