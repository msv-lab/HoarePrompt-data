The code attempts to execute a print statement but contains a syntax error due to the incorrect usage of the print function. As such, no output is generated, and the initial state of the variable remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, and there is a syntax error in the code execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, and there is a syntax error in the code execution.**
