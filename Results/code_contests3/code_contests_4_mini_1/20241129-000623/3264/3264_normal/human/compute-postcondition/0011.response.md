Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` from input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints `-1`. If `n` is odd and greater than 2, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is even and greater than 2, it prints `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is not a valid input or where the input might lead to a syntax error due to the way input is read.**
