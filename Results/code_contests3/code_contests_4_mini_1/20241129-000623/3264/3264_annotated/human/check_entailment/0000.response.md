Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Output for n = 1 or n = 2**: 
   - The problem states that for any input `n` less than or equal to 2, the output should be -1. However, the program attempts to print `-1` but uses incorrect syntax (`print - 1` instead of `print(-1)` in Python 3). This would cause a syntax error.

2. **Missing Handling of n = 1**: 
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where `n = 1` correctly. While it would fall under the condition `n <= 2`, the syntax error means that it would not produce the correct output.

3. **Output Formula for Pythagorean Triples**:
   - For odd integers `n > 2`, the output `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2` is correct and will yield integers that form a Pythagorean triple.
   - For even integers `n`, the formula used `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)` is also correct, yielding integers that form a Pythagorean triple.

4. **Integer Division**: 
   - The program uses the `/` operator which performs floating-point division in Python 3. For integer results, it should use `//` for integer division.

5. **Range of Output Values**: 
   - The program does not ensure that the outputs `m` and `k` are within the specified limits of 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18. While the formulas are mathematically sound for generating Pythagorean triples, without explicit checks or constraints, it might produce values outside the required bounds.

Overall, the program’s handling of edge cases, syntax errors, and integer division leads to incorrect behavior according to the problem description. Thus, it does not meet the requirements.
