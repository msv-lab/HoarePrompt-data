The expression inside the print statement calculates two values based on the variable `n`. The first value is `n * n / 4 - 1`, and the second value is `n * n / 4 + 1`. Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can substitute the variable `n` with its value to obtain the results. 

The values of the variables do not change, but the output consists of the calculated results based on `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive even integer greater than 2, and the printed output is two calculated values based on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive even integer greater than 2; printed output is `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
