The code provided attempts to execute a print statement. However, the syntax is incorrect. The correct syntax for printing in Python is `print(-1)`. Since the current state suggests that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2, it does not affect the print operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that the print operation is attempted but syntactically incorrect, and no variables change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2; attempted to print -1, but syntax is incorrect.**
