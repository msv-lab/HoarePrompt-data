Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` from user input and prints specific calculated values based on `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it attempts to print -1 (but the syntax is incorrect). If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints two values: `(n * n - 1) / 2` and `(n * n + 1) / 2`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints `(n * n / 4 - 1)` and `(n * n / 4 + 1)`. The function does not return a value; it only performs printing operations. **
