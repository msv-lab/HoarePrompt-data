Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, an attempt to print -1 is made, but the syntax is incorrect. If `n` is greater than 2, if `n` is an odd integer, the results are (n * n - 1) / 2 and (n * n + 1) / 2. If `n` is an even integer, the printed output is `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.***
