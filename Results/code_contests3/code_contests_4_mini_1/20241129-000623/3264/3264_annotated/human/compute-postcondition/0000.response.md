The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9, the output state will reflect that `n` is now the input integer provided. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
