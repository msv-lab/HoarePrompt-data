To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its handling of various integer inputs.

The program is structured as follows:

1. It reads an integer `n`.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints `-1`.
3. If `n` is odd, it calculates two integers using the formulas:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
4. If `n` is even, it calculates:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)

Now, let's consider the requirements for forming Pythagorean triples. For a set of integers (n, m, k) to be a Pythagorean triple, they must satisfy the equation:
\[ n^2 + m^2 = k^2 \]

### Test Cases:

1. **For n = 1**:
   - The output is `-1`, which is correct because no Pythagorean triple can contain the number 1 as a side.
   
2. **For n = 2**:
   - The output is `-1`, which is also correct since there are no triples involving the number 2.

3. **For n = 3**:
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = \frac{3^2 - 1}{2} = 4 \)
     - \( k = \frac{3^2 + 1}{2} = 5 \)
   - Check: \( 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 \) (Correct)

4. **For n = 6**:
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = \frac{6^2}{4} - 1 = 8 \)
     - \( k = \frac{6^2}{4} + 1 = 10 \)
   - Check: \( 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10^2 \) (Correct)

5. **For n = 17**:
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = \frac{17^2 - 1}{2} = 144 \)
     - \( k = \frac{17^2 + 1}{2} = 145 \)
   - Check: \( 17^2 + 144^2 = 289 + 20736 = 21025 = 145^2 \) (Correct)

6. **For n = 67**:
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = \frac{67^2 - 1}{2} = 2244 \)
     - \( k = \frac{67^2 + 1}{2} = 2245 \)
   - Check: \( 67^2 + 2244^2 = 4489 + 5037936 = 5037936 + 4489 = 5037925 \) (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- The program has an issue when `n` is an odd number less than 3, specifically when `n = 1` or `n = 2`, it correctly returns `-1`, but the calculations for larger odd numbers seem to work. However, for even numbers, the calculated values can lead to a non-integer \( m \) or \( k \) for certain cases when `n` is not a multiple of 4.

### Conclusion:
After checking various inputs and the derived outputs, the program does not correctly compute the Pythagorean triples for every input as specified in the description. The formulas for even numbers can lead to invalid results when `n` is not a multiple of 4. 

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to produce valid Pythagorean triples for certain even inputs, such as `n = 10`, where the computed values do not satisfy the condition for forming a valid right triangle.
