The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It evaluates the number of coins that five players have at the end of the game, represented by integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, where each c is in the range of 0 to 100. The function returns the player number who has the most coins. In the case of a tie for the most coins, the function returns the player with the lowest number. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to determine which player has the highest number of coins and return that player's number, resolving any ties by selecting the player with the lowest number among those tied.
