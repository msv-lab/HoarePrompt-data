Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Initial Bet Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the initial bet `b` by taking the sum of the coins held by the players (`s = sum(c)`) and dividing it by the number of players (`len(c)`). This approach does not account for the fact that each player must have started with an equal positive initial bet. The program should instead check if the total sum of coins `s` can be evenly divided by 5 (the number of players) and ensure that each player has at least `b` coins at the end.

2. **Handling of Zero Coins**: The program checks if `s == 0` to return `-1`, which is only a partial check. If `s` is zero, it means that the initial bet cannot be positive; however, there could be valid cases where players end up with zero coins after redistribution. The output should also consider the possibility that if any player has fewer coins than `b`, it is impossible for that state to be reached.

3. **Return of `-1`**: The logic for returning `-1` is flawed. The program uses `s % len(c) != 0` to determine if `b` can be a positive integer, but it does not validate whether each player's coin count could realistically reach the end state given a positive bet `b`. 

4. **Input Handling**: The use of `raw_input()` (which is Python 2 syntax) and the conversion to `int` should be done in a way that ensures the correct values are captured and processed. Also, it fails to handle cases where the input is not as expected.

In summary, the program does not correctly determine the initial betting amount `b` based on the final coin counts of the players, as it does not properly account for the required conditions that must be met for a valid game outcome. Therefore, it is not in compliance with the problem description.
