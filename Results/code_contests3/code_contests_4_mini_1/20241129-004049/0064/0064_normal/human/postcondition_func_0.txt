The function accepts no parameters, reads a line of input representing the number of coins held by five players, calculates the total number of coins, and returns -1 if the total is 0 or if the total is not evenly divisible by the number of players (which is always 5). Otherwise, it returns the average number of coins per player. Edge cases include scenarios where all players have zero coins or where the total number of coins is not divisible by 5.
