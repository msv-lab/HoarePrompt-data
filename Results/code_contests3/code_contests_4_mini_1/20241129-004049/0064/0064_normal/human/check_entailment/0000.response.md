To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The task is to find the initial bet `b` for a game where five players have a certain number of coins at the end. The program needs to return:
- A positive integer `b` if such an initial bet exists.
- `-1` if no such positive integer exists.

### Given Program:
```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads five integers representing the coins each player has.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It computes the total number of coins `s`.
3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `s` is `0`, it prints `-1`.
   - If `s` is not divisible by `5` (the number of players), it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints the average `s / len(c)` (which is `s / 5`).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **All Players Have Zero Coins**: The program correctly identifies this case as `-1` since `s` would be `0`.
2. **Total Coins Not Divisible by 5**: For example, if the inputs are `1 2 3 4 5`, the total is `15`, which is divisible by `5`, so it would output `3`. If the inputs are `1 1 1 1 1`, the total is `5`, which also divides evenly to give `1`.
3. **Positive Valid Cases**: If players have coins like `2 5 4 0 4`, the total is `15` and dividing by `5` gives `3`, which is valid.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state:
- The function returns `-1` if the total is `0` or not evenly divisible by `5`. Otherwise, it returns the average number of coins per player.
- It mentions edge cases where all players have zero coins or the total number of coins is not divisible by `5`.

### Conclusion on Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the case where all players have zero coins by returning `-1`.
- It correctly checks if the total coins are divisible by `5` and returns `-1` if not.
- The average calculation is correct since it divides the total by `5` (the number of players).

After careful analysis, I can't find a case where the program fails to follow the problem description. The logic aligns well with the provided hints, and all edge cases have been considered.

Correctness: **True**.
