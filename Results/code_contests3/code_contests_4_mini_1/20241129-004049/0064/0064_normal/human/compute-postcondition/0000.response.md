The variable `c` is assigned the values obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means that it will take input from the user, split it into separate values, and convert each value into an integer. This will replace the previous values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` with the new integer values entered. Since the specific values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5` are not given, we can only state that they will be updated based on the user input.

Output State: **`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are updated to the new integer values from user input.**
