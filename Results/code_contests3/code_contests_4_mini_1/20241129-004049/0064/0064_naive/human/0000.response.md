To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code in the context of the problem description.

**Problem description**: We need to determine the size of the initial bet \( b \) such that after operations, the final number of coins for each player matches the provided counts. If it's not possible to have such an initial bet, we should return -1.

Here's the provided program:
```python
c = map(int, raw_input().split())
s = sum(c)
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game.
2. **Sum Calculation**: It calculates the total number of coins `s` that all players have.
3. **Logic for Initial Bet**:
   - It checks if `s` is 0. If true, it prints -1 because if all players have 0 coins, they could not have made any bets.
   - It checks if `s` is not divisible by the number of players (which is 5). If true, it prints -1 because if the total coins are not evenly divisible by 5, there cannot be a valid initial bet \( b \) that would result in the given final amounts.
   - If neither condition is met, it calculates the initial bet \( b \) as \( s / 5 \).

### Cases to Consider
1. **Case where all players have 0 coins**: The program correctly returns -1.
2. **Case where total coins are not divisible by 5**: The program correctly returns -1.
3. **Valid case where coins are divisible by 5**: The program calculates \( b = s / 5 \).

### Edge Cases
However, there is a potential edge case that the program does not handle:
- **Negative Result**: If the total number of coins \( s \) is less than 5, the division would yield a non-positive integer (which is not allowed as \( b \) must be a positive integer). For example, if the input is `1 1 1 1 1`, the sum is 5, which leads to a valid bet of 1. But if we take `0 0 0 0 1`, the sum is 1, leading to an invalid situation since it would output \( b = 0.2 \) when it should return -1.

### Conclusion
The program fails to return the correct output for cases where the total number of coins is less than 5, resulting in a non-positive \( b \).

Correctness: **False**.
