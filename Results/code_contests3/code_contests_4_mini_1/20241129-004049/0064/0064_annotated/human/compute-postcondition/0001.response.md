The variable `s` is assigned the value of `sum(c)`, which calculates the total of the integer values in `c`. The previous values of `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are not directly affected by this operation, but `s` now holds the sum of all values in `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers representing the number of coins each player has; `s` is the sum of the integer values in `c`.

Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers representing the number of coins each player has; `s` is the sum of the integer values in `c`.**
