The variable `c` is assigned the values obtained from `raw_input().split()`, which takes input as a string, splits it into separate components, and converts each to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are not directly affected in terms of their individual assignments but can be represented in a new collection `c`. Since the specific input values for `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `c` contains the integer values of coins from the input.

Output State: **`c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers representing the number of coins each player has; `c` contains the integer values from input.**
