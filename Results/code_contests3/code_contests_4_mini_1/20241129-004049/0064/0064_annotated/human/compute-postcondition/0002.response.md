To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the given code snippet.

Initial State: `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5` are integers representing the number of coins each player has; `s` is the sum of the integer values in `c`.

Given the context, `c` can be assumed to be a list or collection of the integers `c1, c2, c3, c4, c5`. Therefore, we can express `s` as:

```
s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5
```

The code snippet provided is:

```
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

Here, `len(c)` would be 5 since there are five players (c1, c2, c3, c4, c5).

Now we analyze the conditions:
1. If `s == 0`, the output will be `-1`.
2. If `s % 5 != 0`, the output will also be `-1`.
3. If neither condition is true, the output will be `s / 5`.

Thus, the output state will be determined based on the value of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is either 0 or not divisible by 5, output is -1; otherwise, output is `s / 5`**.
