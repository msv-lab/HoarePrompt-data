Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Understanding of the Initial Bet**: According to the problem description, each player initially bets a positive number of coins `b`. The final number of coins each player has after the game must reflect this initial bet. Therefore, the total number of coins at the end of the game must be equal to `5 * b` (where `5` is the number of players).

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the coins each player has (denoted as `s`). However, the program checks if `s` is zero or if `s` cannot be evenly divided by `len(c)` (which is always `5` in this case). This is not a suitable check because:
   - If `s == 0`, it implies that all players ended up with zero coins. This cannot happen if each player initially bets a positive number of coins.
   - The check `s % len(c) != 0` is meant to determine if `s` is evenly divisible by `5`. However, the correct check should be to see if `s % 5 == 0` and if `s > 0` to ensure that a positive initial bet exists.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `s / len(c)` (which is `s / 5`), but it should actually return `s / 5` only if `s` is a positive multiple of `5`. If `s` is not a positive multiple of `5`, the output should be `-1`, indicating that such an outcome is not possible based on the initial bets.

The correct logic would be:
- Calculate the total number of coins `s`.
- Check if `s` is greater than `0` and if `s % 5 == 0`.
- If both conditions are satisfied, return `s / 5`.
- Otherwise, return `-1`.

The current implementation does not satisfy these conditions and therefore does not correctly solve the problem as defined.
