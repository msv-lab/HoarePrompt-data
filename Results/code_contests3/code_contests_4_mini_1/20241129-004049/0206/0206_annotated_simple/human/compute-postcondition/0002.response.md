To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet.

The code snippet is:
```
ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))
```

1. `a` is a list of strings from input.
2. `np.max(a)` will find the maximum value in the list of strings `a`, and `np.min(a)` will find the minimum value in the same list.
3. The difference between these two maximum and minimum values is calculated.
4. `np.abs()` then takes the absolute value of that difference to ensure it's non-negative.

Since `a` consists of strings, we cannot compute `np.max()` and `np.min()` directly unless we know the exact content of `a`. However, assuming that the strings can be compared lexicographically, `np.max(a)` would return the string that is considered "largest" in that ordering, while `np.min(a)` would return the "smallest" string. The difference between the two strings here would be computed based on their ordinal values.

However, since we need a specific output state, we can conclude:
- `ans` will be assigned the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum strings based on their lexicographical order.

Therefore, the output state would reflect the values of `a` and the computed `ans`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of strings from input; `ans` is the absolute difference between the max and min strings in `a`.**
