Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input for the number of houses \( N \) and the coordinates of the houses, but it does this using `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3. In Python 3, it should be `input()`. Additionally, `raw_input()` would return a string, and the program does not convert the coordinates into integers, which is necessary for correct calculations.

2. The calculation for the minimum distance to be traveled is incorrect. The program calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a` using `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`. However, it does not take into account that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any position. The minimum distance required should be the distance between the furthest points (i.e., maximum and minimum coordinates), which is correctly calculated, but the program is incorrectly using raw input and lacks necessary type conversions.

3. The function does not handle the case where there is only one house. In that case, the distance to be traveled should be zero, but the current implementation would still compute the distance as the difference between the same coordinate.

Given these reasons, the implementation does not correctly adhere to the problem description across all potential cases.
