To evaluate the provided code snippet, we need to understand the variables involved:

- `N` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `a` is a list of strings, which consists of `N` space-separated values.

The code snippet calculates `ans` as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. Here, since `a` consists of strings, we need to clarify that the `np.max()` and `np.min()` functions will operate on the lexicographical order of the strings.

1. `np.max(a)` retrieves the maximum value from the list `a`.
2. `np.min(a)` retrieves the minimum value from the list `a`.
3. `np.abs(...)` computes the absolute difference between these two values.

Since we do not have the actual content of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact values for `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)`. But we can confirm that `ans` will be the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum strings in `a`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` has been calculated, but the exact values of `max(a)` and `min(a)` are unspecified, leading to the conclusion:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of strings; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in `a`.**
