Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer N (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a list of N integers (where each integer is between 0 and 1000). It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints the result. However, it does not return any value or handle invalid input cases such as non-integer inputs or out-of-bounds values for N or elements in the list. **
