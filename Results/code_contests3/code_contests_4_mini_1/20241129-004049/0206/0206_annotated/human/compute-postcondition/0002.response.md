To evaluate the expression `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`, we need to consider the following steps:

1. `np.max(a)` calculates the maximum value from the list `a`, which contains `N` strings representing integers.
2. `np.min(a)` calculates the minimum value from the list `a`.
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum values is computed: `np.max(a) - np.min(a)`.
4. Finally, `np.abs(...)` takes the absolute value of that difference.

Given that `a` is a list of strings representing integers, we need to convert those strings to integers before finding the maximum and minimum. The initial state does not provide the specific integers represented in `a`, but we know that they will be within the range of positive integers as stated (1 to 100).

Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `ans` will hold the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum integers from the list `a` after all calculations are performed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings representing integers; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum integers in `a`.**
