The variable `a` is assigned the value from `raw_input().split()`, which means it will take an input string, split it by whitespace, and assign the resulting list of strings to `a`. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer and will determine the number of integers expected in the input. Each integer in `a` will be a string representation of the integers provided in the input.

Since `N` is assigned a value from `raw_input()`, the actual values of the integers in `a` depend on the user input, but the length of `a` will equal `N`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of strings representing the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` strings representing integers from input.**
