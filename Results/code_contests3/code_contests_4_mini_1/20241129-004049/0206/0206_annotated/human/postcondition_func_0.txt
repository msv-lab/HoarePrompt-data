The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a list of N integers a, where each integer satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list and prints this difference. However, the function does not handle any input errors or validate that the input list contains exactly N integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input does not match the expected format.
