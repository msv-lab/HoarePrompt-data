Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the input as specified in the problem description correctly. Specifically:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is suitable for Python 2, but the problem appears to be written for Python 3 where `input()` should be used instead. This could lead to errors when trying to run the program in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Data Type Conversion**: The values read from input are initially strings. The program does not convert them to integers before calculating the maximum and minimum. The calculation `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` will not work as expected because `a` is a list of strings, not integers. This will result in incorrect behavior.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The calculation of the distance as `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))` is incorrect because `np.max()` and `np.min()` will not be able to compute the correct maximum and minimum values from a list of strings. The program needs to convert the list `a` from strings to integers first.

4. **Assumption about Input Size**: The program does not check if the number of integers input actually matches `N`, which could lead to unexpected behavior if fewer or more integers are given.

In summary, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description due to input handling issues and incorrect data type usage, which can lead to incorrect output.
