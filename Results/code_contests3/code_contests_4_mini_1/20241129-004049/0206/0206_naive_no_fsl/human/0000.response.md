To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

The problem requires us to calculate the minimum distance AtCoDeer has to travel to deliver gifts to all houses located at given coordinates. The key point here is that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions, which means the minimum distance to travel is simply the distance between the farthest houses.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
N = raw_input()
a = raw_input().split()
ans = np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))
print(ans)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads `N`, which indicates the number of houses. However, it doesn't convert `N` to an integer or use it in any way. 
   - It reads the house coordinates as strings and splits them into a list `a`.

2. **Calculating the Distance**:
   - The program uses `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` to find the maximum and minimum coordinates. However, since `a` is a list of strings, this will lead to incorrect results. The maximum and minimum will be determined lexicographically (as strings) instead of numerically (as integers).
   
3. **Type Conversion**:
   - The program does not convert the string values in `a` to integers before calculating the minimum and maximum distances.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `N` is 1 (only one house), the distance should be 0 because AtCoDeer starts and ends at the same house. The current implementation would incorrectly compute this as `np.abs(max_value - min_value)` for a single element.
   - The program uses `np.abs` which implies `numpy` is imported, but there is no import statement in the provided code.

### Example Case Where Program Fails:

Let's consider the input where `N = 1` and the coordinate is `5`:
```
1
5
```

- The expected output is `0` because AtCoDeer does not have to travel if there is only one house.
- The program, however, would attempt to compute `np.max(['5'])` and `np.min(['5'])`, which would both return `'5'` as strings, leading to `np.abs('5' - '5')` resulting in an error, as string subtraction is not valid in Python.

### Conclusion:

Due to the reasons outlined above, particularly the issue with string handling and missing conversion to integers, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
