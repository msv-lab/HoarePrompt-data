Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum distance that AtCoDeer must travel to deliver gifts to all the houses. The program calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which represents the distance between the two endpoints. However, the problem description states that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any position. This means that the minimum distance he needs to travel should simply be the distance between the furthest houses, which is given as `max(a) - min(a)`.

However, the distance should also account for the fact that if he can start and end at any position, he only needs to travel the total distance from the farthest left house to the farthest right house and back, which is `2 * (max(a) - min(a))`. 

Additionally, the program does not handle input correctly because it uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input()`. Furthermore, it does not convert the input strings to integers before processing, which will lead to incorrect results since `np.max()` and `np.min()` will not work as intended on string data.

For example, if the input is:
```
4
2 3 7 9
```
The expected output should be:
```
7
```
But when calculating the distance with the current logic, the program would output:
```
7
```
For the input:
```
1
0
```
The program would output:
```
0
```
This is correct, but the logic is flawed overall.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to an overall conclusion of incorrectness.
