The code assigns values to `n` and `V` by reading input from the user and converting it to integers. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 20, and `V` is an integer within the range 1 to 10000. After executing the code, `n` and `V` will hold the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `V` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000.**
