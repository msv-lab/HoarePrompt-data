The code assigns two lists, `a` and `b`, with values obtained from user input. Each list is populated by converting the input values to floats. The initial state indicates that `n` and `V` are input integers, but they do not affect the values being assigned to `a` and `b`. The specific values for `a` and `b` depend on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20; `V` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of floats from the first input; `b` is a list of floats from the second input.**
