The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20.
- `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, each between 1 and 100.
- `b` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, each between 0 and 100.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information; therefore, we cannot specify the return values. However, based on the constraints and relationships, we can summarize the functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `V`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 100, and `b` is a list of `n` non-negative integers between 0 and 100.**
