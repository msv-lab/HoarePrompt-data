The values of `n` and `V` are assigned the values obtained from `raw_input()` split into two parts and converted to integers. The previous state of `n` and `V` is not specified, but they will now hold the values provided by the user input. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000, `a` is a list of n positive integers each between 1 and 100, and `b` is a list of n non-negative integers each between 0 and 100.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, `V` is a positive integer between 1 and 10000, `a` is a list of n positive integers each between 1 and 100, and `b` is a list of n non-negative integers each between 0 and 100.**
