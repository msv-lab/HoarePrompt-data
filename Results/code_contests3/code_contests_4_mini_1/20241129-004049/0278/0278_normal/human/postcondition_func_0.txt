The function accepts two integers `n` and `V`, followed by two lists of `n` floating-point numbers `a` and `b`. It calculates and prints the minimum value of a specific expression involving the elements of `a` and `b`, subject to the constraint `V`. The function does not handle cases where the input lists may contain zeros or invalid data types, which could potentially lead to errors. Additionally, the function uses `raw_input`, which may not work in Python 3, indicating that it is not compatible with the latest Python versions.
