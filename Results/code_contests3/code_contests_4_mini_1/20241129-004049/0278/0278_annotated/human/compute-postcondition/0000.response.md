The variables `n` and `V` are assigned values from `raw_input()`, which accepts input and splits it into two parts, converting them to integers. The values of `n` and `V` will now be determined by the input provided, but the specific values of `n` and `V` are not given in the initial state. Other variables (`a` and `b`) remain unchanged after this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `b` is a list of n integers where each bi is such that 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100; `n` and `V` are now input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ V ≤ 10000, `a` is a list of n integers where each ai is such that 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100, and `b` is a list of n integers where each bi is such that 0 ≤ bi ≤ 100; `n` and `V` are now input integers.**
