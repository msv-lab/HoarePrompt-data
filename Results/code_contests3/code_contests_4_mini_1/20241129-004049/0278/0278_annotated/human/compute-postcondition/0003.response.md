The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\). 
- `V`: an integer such that \(1 \leq V \leq 10000\). 
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where each \(a_i\) is such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\). 
- `b`: a list of `n` integers where each \(b_i\) is such that \(0 \leq b_i \leq 100\). 

The output of the function is based on the provided constraints and relationships. However, the specific return values and conditions based on the inputs are not provided in the prompt. 

To summarize, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `V`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and a list `b` of `n` integers, all adhering to their respective constraints. The exact output values or behavior based on these inputs needs further details to be specified. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, V, a, and b with specified constraints on their values.**
