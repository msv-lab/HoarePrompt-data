The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and calculates a value `answr` based on `n` and its integer square root `x`. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `answr` as `4 * x`. If `n` is not a perfect square and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, it returns `answr` as `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, it returns `answr` as `4 * (x + 1)`. The function prints the calculated `answr` but does not return it, which may lead to confusion since the description implies a return value that is not explicitly stated in the code.
