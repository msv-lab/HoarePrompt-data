To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the shortest perimeter that encloses exactly N city blocks arranged in a square grid. The perimeter must be calculated based on the possible shapes that can enclose the area of N blocks.

### Code Review:
```python
import math

n = int(input())
x = int(n ** 0.5)
if x ** 2 == n:
    answr = x * 4
elif x * (x + 1) > n:
    answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
else:
    answr = 4 * (x + 1)
answr = int(answr)
print(answr)
```

1. **Perfect Square Check**: The code first checks if N is a perfect square. If it is, it calculates the perimeter as `4 * x`, where `x` is the integer square root of N. This is correct because for a perfect square area, the shape with the smallest perimeter is a square.

2. **Non-Perfect Square Check**: The second condition checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`. If this is true, it calculates the perimeter as `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which represents a rectangle that could be formed with dimensions close to `x` and `x + 1`. 

3. **Fallback Case**: If neither of the first two conditions are satisfied, it computes the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)`, which corresponds to enclosing the area with a shape that has a width or height of `x + 1`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **N = 1**: The smallest input should yield a perimeter of 4 (a square of 1x1).
   - Expected: 4
   - Code output: `answr = 4 * (0 + 1) = 4` → Correct.

2. **N = 2**: This should also be handled correctly.
   - Expected: 6 (the minimal perimeter for enclosing 2 blocks is a 1x2 rectangle).
   - Code output: `answr = 4 * (0 + 1) = 4` → Incorrect.

3. **N = 3**: Similar to above.
   - Expected: 8 (the minimal perimeter for enclosing 3 blocks can be a 1x3 rectangle).
   - Code output: `answr = 4 * (0 + 1) = 4` → Incorrect.

4. **N = 4**: This case is correctly handled as discussed.
   - Expected: 8
   - Code output: `answr = 4 * 1 = 8` → Correct.

5. **Larger Values**: We can also consider larger values of N such as N = 11 and N = 22, which are also mentioned in the problem description and would require careful handling of the perimeter calculations.

### Conclusion:
The output hints suggest that the code does not correctly handle cases where N is not a perfect square, particularly for small values of N (like 2 and 3). 

Since the program does not follow the problem description correctly for some values of N, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

The primary failing case is that for N = 2 and N = 3, the computed perimeters are incorrect, failing to account for the minimal shapes that could enclose those areas.
