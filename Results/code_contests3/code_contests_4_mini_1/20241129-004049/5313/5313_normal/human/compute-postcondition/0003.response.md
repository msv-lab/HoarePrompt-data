`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` and `x` squared is equal to `n`, we have `n = x^2`. Therefore, `answr` will be `4 * x`. The specific numeric value of `answr` depends on the value of `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`**.
