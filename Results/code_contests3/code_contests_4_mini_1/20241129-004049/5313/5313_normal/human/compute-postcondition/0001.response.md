The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which calculates the square root of `n` and converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 1,000,000, so `x` will be the integer part of the square root of `n`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.**
