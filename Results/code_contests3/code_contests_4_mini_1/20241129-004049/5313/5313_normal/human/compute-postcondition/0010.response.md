Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x ** 2` equals `n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * x`. If `x ** 2` does not equal `n` and `x` is greater than 0, if `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2. Otherwise, `answr` is 4 * (x + 1).***
