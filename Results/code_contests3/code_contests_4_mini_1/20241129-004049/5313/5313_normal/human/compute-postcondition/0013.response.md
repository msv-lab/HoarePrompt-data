The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the internal logic defined within its body. After executing the function, it produces an output based on the constraints provided, specifically that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6. 

However, since there are no defined outputs or conditions provided in the output section, we cannot specify the exact return values or behaviors of the function based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
