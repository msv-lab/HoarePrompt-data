To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic and identify if it meets the requirements for all potential cases.

The problem requires calculating the minimum perimeter that can enclose an area of exactly N blocks in a square grid. The perimeter needs to be minimized based on the shape that can enclose the given area.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. `x = int(n ** 0.5)` calculates the integer square root of N, which would represent the side length of a square if N were a perfect square.
2. The first condition checks if `x ** 2 == n`, which means if N is a perfect square. If it is, the perimeter is simply `x * 4` (because the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length).
3. The second condition `elif x * (x + 1) > n` checks if the area of a rectangle with dimensions `x` by `x + 1` exceeds N. If it does, the perimeter is calculated as `(x + x + 1) * 2`.
4. If neither condition is met, it assumes that a rectangle with dimensions `(x + 1)` by `x` can be formed, thus calculating the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)`.

### Potential Cases:
- **Perfect Square Case**: For example, if N = 4 (which is 2x2), the perimeter correctly returns 8.
- **Just Over a Perfect Square**: If N = 11, `x` would be 3, and since `3 * (3 + 1) > 11` is false, it calculates the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)` which results in 14 (correct).
- **Non-Perfect Square with Exact Rectangle**: For N = 22, `x` is 4, and the program correctly calculates the perimeter as 20.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Minimum Input**: For N = 1, `x` is 1, and since it is a perfect square, the program should output a perimeter of 4 (correct).
- **Maximum Input**: For N = 1,000,000, `x` would be 1000, and since it is a perfect square, the program should output a perimeter of 4000 (correct).

### Conclusion:
Upon testing various scenarios and examining the logic, it appears that the program correctly calculates the perimeter for all provided cases and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program successfully computes the minimum perimeter for enclosing N blocks in a grid, adhering to the problem requirements for all possible cases.
