The program aims to compute the minimum perimeter required to enclose an area of exactly N city blocks, as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the logic in the annotated program to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer input `n`, which represents the number of city blocks (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Perfect Square Check**: The program first checks if `n` is a perfect square:
   - If `n` is a perfect square (`x ** 2 == n`), it calculates the perimeter as `4 * x`. This is correct since a perfect square with side length `x` has a perimeter of `4x`.

3. **Non-Perfect Square Check**: If `n` is not a perfect square, the program then checks whether `x * (x + 1) > n`:
   - If this condition is true, it calculates the perimeter as `2 * (2 * x + 1)`. However, this expression simplifies to `4 * x + 2`, which is indeed the perimeter of a rectangle that encloses area `n` when the width and height are close to `x` and `x + 1`, respectively.
   - If the condition is false, it calculates the perimeter as `4 * (x + 1)`, which corresponds to surrounding an area that is slightly more than a perfect square.

4. **Output**: The result is printed as an integer, which is consistent with the expected output format.

### Verification Against Examples:
- For `N = 4`: 
  - `x = 2`, since `2^2 = 4`, it returns `4 * 2 = 8`. **Correct**.
  
- For `N = 11`:
  - `x = 3`, since `3 * (3 + 1) = 12 > 11`, it returns `2 * (2 * 3 + 1) = 14`. **Correct**.

- For `N = 22`:
  - `x = 4`, since `4 * (4 + 1) = 20 < 22`, it returns `4 * (4 + 1) = 20`. **Correct**.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem description and computes the minimum perimeter for the given area N. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
