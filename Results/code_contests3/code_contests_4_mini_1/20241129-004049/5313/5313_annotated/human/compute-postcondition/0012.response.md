The code `print(answr)` outputs the value of the variable `answr`. The previous values of `N`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this statement. However, the output will reflect the current integer value of `answr`. Since `answr` is already converted to an integer, it will simply print that value.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is the current integer value and has been printed.**
