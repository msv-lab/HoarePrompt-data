The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^6 \). Based on this constraint, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without further details on the return value, we cannot describe the functionality completely. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified.**
