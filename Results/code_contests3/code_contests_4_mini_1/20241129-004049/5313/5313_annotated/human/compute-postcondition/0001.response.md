`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which calculates the integer square root of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer and is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6, the value of `x` will be the largest integer `k` such that `k * k ≤ n`. The value of `N` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`**
