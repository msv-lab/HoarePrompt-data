To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided initial state and code snippet step by step.

Initial State: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. The value of `n` is not a perfect square, and it holds that `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`.

The code snippet is:
```
answr = 4 * (x + 1)
```

1. The variable `x` is already defined as the integer square root of `n`. Since `n` is not a perfect square, `x` is the largest integer such that \( x^2 < n \).
2. The expression `4 * (x + 1)` calculates a new variable `answr` based on the value of `x`. Since `x` holds an integer value, `x + 1` will also be an integer, and multiplying by 4 will yield another integer.

Since we do not have the specific value of `x`, we recognize that `answr` will be a multiple of 4 that is determined by the value of `x`. However, the specific integer value for `answr` cannot be determined without knowing `n`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between the variables without providing a specific value for `answr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is calculated as 4 * (x + 1)**.
