The variable `answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n`, and since `x` squared is equal to `n`, the value of `answr` will be `4 * x`. The previous values of the affected variables are `N`, `n`, and `x`. The values of `N` and `n` are not directly needed for the calculation of `answr`, but `x` can be calculated from `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4.**
