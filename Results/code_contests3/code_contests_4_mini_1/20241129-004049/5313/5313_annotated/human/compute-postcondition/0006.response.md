The value of `answr` is assigned the expression `(x + x + 1) * 2`. The variable `x` is defined as the integer square root of `n`, and since `n` is not a perfect square, we can conclude that `x` is less than the actual square root of `n`. The expression simplifies to `(2x + 1) * 2`, which equals `4x + 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`**.
