`answr` is assigned the value of `x * 4`. Since `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` and `x` squared is equal to `n`, this means that `n` is a perfect square. Thus, `answr` will be 4 times the integer square root of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `x * 4.**
