The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, the function is designed to operate with a positive integer `N` such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\). However, since `N` is not passed as a parameter to the function, it is likely that `N` is utilized within the function body in some manner, possibly through global variables or other means not specified in the prompt. 

As there are no specific return values or cases detailed in the output, we cannot determine the exact functionality of the function. Therefore, we can only state that:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
