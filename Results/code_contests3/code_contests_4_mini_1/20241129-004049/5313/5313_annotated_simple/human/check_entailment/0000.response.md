Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum perimeter that can enclose exactly N blocks in all cases. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. For a given integer N, the minimum perimeter is not simply derived from the integer part of the square root of N. The program calculates the integer square root `x` and checks if `x * (x + 1) > n`, which is not a valid condition for determining the perimeter of the enclosing shape.

2. The program handles a perfect square by returning `x * 4`, which is correct for square shapes but does not account for non-square shapes that may yield a smaller perimeter.

3. When N is not a perfect square, the perimeter calculation is done using the conditions to derive `answr`:
   - It is set to `(x + x + 1) * 2` if `x * (x + 1) > n`, which does not guarantee the minimum perimeter for all possible rectangular configurations.
   - It is set to `4 * (x + 1)` otherwise, which again does not cover all possible configurations that could yield a smaller perimeter.

4. The program does not consider all possible rectangular dimensions that can enclose exactly N blocks. The minimum perimeter can be calculated by finding pairs of factors of N (width and height) and determining the perimeter as `2 * (width + height)`. This is not what the program does.

In summary, the program provides an incorrect calculation of perimeter for various values of N, particularly when N is not a perfect square or when other shapes could yield a smaller perimeter. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem description accurately.
