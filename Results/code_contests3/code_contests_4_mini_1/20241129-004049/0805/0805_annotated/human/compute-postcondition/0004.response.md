According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `strings`. For the loop to execute at least once, `strings` must contain at least one character. The variable `N` does not affect the execution of the loop, but it is important to note that it must satisfy the condition 0 <= `N` <= 26. The variable `s` will represent each character in `strings` during the iterations.

Since `new_strings` is an empty string, it doesn't influence the execution of the loop either. However, we need to ensure that `strings` is indeed an input string with characters for the loop to run.

So, for the loop to execute, we need `strings` to be a non-empty string.

State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`**
