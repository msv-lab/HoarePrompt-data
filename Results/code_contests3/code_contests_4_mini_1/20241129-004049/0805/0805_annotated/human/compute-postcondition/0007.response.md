The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is previously computed as `index + N`, where `index` is the position of the character `s` in `letters`, and `N` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 26. Since `added_index` can vary based on the values of `index` and `N`, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship of the variables but does not specify exact values as they are dependent on the initial conditions.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + N`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
