Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary, and prints the resulting transformed string. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the transformed string directly. **
