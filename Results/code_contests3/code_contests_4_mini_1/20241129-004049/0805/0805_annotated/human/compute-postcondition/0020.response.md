To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, let's break down the provided initial state and the code.

Initial State:
- `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26.
- `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters.
- `s` is the third character of `strings`.
- `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` is `index + N`.
- `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

The code being executed is:
```
new_s = letters[new_index]
```

Step by step impact of the code:
1. `new_index` was previously computed as `added_index % 26`, which gives the new position in `letters` based on the original index of `s` plus `N`.
2. `new_s` is assigned the value of the character located at `new_index` in the `letters` string.

Since `new_index` is derived from `index` and `N`, `new_s` will be a letter that depends on those calculations. The values of `S`, `N`, `strings`, `s`, `index`, and `added_index` are not directly impacted by this line, but `new_s` is now defined.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of the affected variables and the newly computed `new_s`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `strings` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `s` is the third character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + N`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at `letters[new_index]`.**
