The value of `new_s` is appended to `new_strings`. Since `new_index` is derived from `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is determined based on the value of `letters` at that index. The previous state of `new_strings` is not modified directly in the provided code, but it is updated to include the new value of `new_s`. Therefore, the output state is: `new_index` is derived from `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is assigned from `letters` at that index, and `new_strings` now contains the previous value plus `new_s`.

Output State: **`new_index` is derived from `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is assigned from `letters` at that index, and `new_strings` now contains the previous value plus `new_s`.**
