The value of `added_index` is assigned the result of `index + n`. The variable `index` reflects the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer that can range from 0 to 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be equal to the current value of `index` plus the value of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`.**
