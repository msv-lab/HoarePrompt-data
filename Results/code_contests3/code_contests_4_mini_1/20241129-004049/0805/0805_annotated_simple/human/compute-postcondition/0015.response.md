To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet. 

The line `new_strings += new_s` means that `new_s` will be concatenated to `new_strings`. The previous values of the relevant variables are as follows:

- `new_strings`: This is the variable that will be updated by adding `new_s` to it.
- `new_s`: This character is derived from the calculation involving the variables `index`, `n`, and `letters`.

Since the other variables (`S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`) are not directly impacted by this line of code, they do not change.

Therefore, after executing the line of code, the output state focuses on the updated value of `new_strings`, which will now include `new_s`.

Output State: **`new_strings` is updated by appending `new_s`**
