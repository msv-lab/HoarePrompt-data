To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and code snippet.

Initial State: `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is `index + n`.

The code `new_s = letters[new_index]` assigns the value of `letters[new_index]` to `new_s`. Here, `new_index` is already defined as `added_index % 26`, which means `new_index` will yield a value based on the modulus operation on `added_index`.

Assuming `letters` is a list or string containing at least 26 elements (e.g., the English alphabet), `new_s` will store the character from `letters` at the position `new_index`.

Since the values of `index` and `n` are not given explicitly, we cannot determine the exact value of `added_index` or `new_index`, but we know that `new_s` will be assigned a specific character based on the calculated `new_index`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`new_index` is derived from `added_index % 26`, and `new_s` is assigned the value from `letters` at that index.**
