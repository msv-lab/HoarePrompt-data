The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous value of `index` is known, but the value of `n` is unspecified. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship involving `index` and `n`. The other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `new_strings` is updated by appending `new_s`, `strings` has at least one more string, `s` is the next string in the list, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, and `added_index` is `index + n`.
