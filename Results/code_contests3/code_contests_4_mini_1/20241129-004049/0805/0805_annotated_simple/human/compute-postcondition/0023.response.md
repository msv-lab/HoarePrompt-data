The code prints the value of `new_strings`, which is already defined as the result of shifting each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet. The values of `S`, `N`, `n`, and `strings` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the definition and result of `new_strings` but does not alter any other variables.

Output State: **`new_strings` is the result of shifting each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the original input string.**
