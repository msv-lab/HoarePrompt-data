The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `N`. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\). The function does not have any specific output described, so we cannot determine any return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `S` of uppercase letters and an integer `N` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer N such that 0 <= N <= 26.**
