The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is previously defined as `index + n`. Since the specific values of `index` and `n` are not provided, we can only express `new_index` in terms of these variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `new_index`, `added_index`, `index`, and `n`.

Output State: **`new_index` is `added_index % 26`, where `added_index` is `index + n`.**
