The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each letter in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary (e.g., shifting 'Z' by 1 will result in 'A'). The function does not validate the input for `n`, and it assumes the user will provide a valid integer within the range 0 to 26. It then prints the resulting shifted string.
