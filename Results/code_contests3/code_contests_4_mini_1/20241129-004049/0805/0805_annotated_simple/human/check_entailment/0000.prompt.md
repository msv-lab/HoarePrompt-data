You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a string S consisting of uppercase English letters. Additionally, an integer N will be given.

Shift each character of S by N in alphabetical order (see below), and print the resulting string.

We assume that `A` follows `Z`. For example, shifting `A` by 2 results in `C` (`A` \to `B` \to `C`), and shifting `Y` by 3 results in `B` (`Y` \to `Z` \to `A` \to `B`).

Constraints

* 0 \leq N \leq 26
* 1 \leq |S| \leq 10^4
* S consists of uppercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
S


Output

Print the string resulting from shifting each character of S by N in alphabetical order.

Examples

Input

2
ABCXYZ


Output

CDEZAB


Input

0
ABCXYZ


Output

ABCXYZ


Input

13
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ


Output

NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and N is an integer such that 0 <= N <= 26.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    strings = input()
    letters = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    new_strings = ''
    for s in strings:
        index = letters.index(s)
        
        added_index = index + n
        
        new_index = added_index % 26
        
        new_s = letters[new_index]
        
        new_strings += new_s
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `new_strings` is the result of shifting each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is the original input string.
    print(new_strings)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
