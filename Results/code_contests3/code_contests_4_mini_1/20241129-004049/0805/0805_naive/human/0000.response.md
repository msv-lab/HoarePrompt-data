Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the shifting of each character in the string `S` by the integer `N` in alphabetical order. It handles the wrap-around from `Z` to `A` using the modulo operation, ensuring that the shift remains within the bounds of the English alphabet. 

1. The variable `letters` contains all uppercase letters from `A` to `Z`.
2. For each character in the input string `S`, the program finds its index in `letters`.
3. It then calculates the new index by adding `N` to the current index and taking the result modulo 26 to handle wrap-around.
4. Finally, it constructs the new string by concatenating the shifted characters and prints the result.

The program has been verified against the constraints provided in the problem description, including edge cases such as:
- Shifting by 0 (which returns the original string).
- Shifting characters at the end of the alphabet (e.g., `Y` shifted by 3 results in `B`).

Since the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, it is correct.
