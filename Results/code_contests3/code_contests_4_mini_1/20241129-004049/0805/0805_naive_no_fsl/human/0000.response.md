Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to shift each character of the string `S` by `N` positions in the alphabetical order of uppercase English letters. 

### Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S` consisting of uppercase letters. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Character Shifting**:
   - It uses a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters to determine the index of each character in `S`.
   - For each character `s` in `S`, the program finds its index in `letters`, adds `N` to that index, and uses modulo 26 to wrap around if the result exceeds the number of letters (26). This ensures that after `Z`, it wraps back to `A`.

3. **Output**: The program constructs a new string `new_strings` which holds the shifted characters and prints it.

### Edge Cases:
- When `N` is 0, the output is the same as the input string `S`, which is handled correctly.
- The program correctly wraps around when `N` is such that it would exceed 26, as demonstrated by the example with `13` shifting all letters to their corresponding positions after half the alphabet.

Thus, the code successfully meets the requirements for all possible inputs as defined in the problem statement.
