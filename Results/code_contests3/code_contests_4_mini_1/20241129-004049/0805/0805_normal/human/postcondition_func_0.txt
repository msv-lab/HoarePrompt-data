The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It transforms each letter in `strings` by shifting it `n` positions forward in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The transformed string is then printed. However, the function does not handle cases where the input for `n` is not within the specified range (0 to 26), nor does it validate the input string for characters outside the uppercase English letters.
