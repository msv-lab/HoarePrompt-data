The value of `index` is assigned the position of the character `s` in the string `letters`. The previous states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer (0 <= `N` <= 26); `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least one character remaining; `s` is the next character in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26; `new_s` is the character at position `new_index` in `letters`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.
