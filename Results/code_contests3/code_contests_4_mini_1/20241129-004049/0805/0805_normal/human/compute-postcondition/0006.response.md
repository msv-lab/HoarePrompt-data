The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is based on the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 26. The other variables, such as `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `s`, and `new_strings`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, and `added_index` is `index + n`.
