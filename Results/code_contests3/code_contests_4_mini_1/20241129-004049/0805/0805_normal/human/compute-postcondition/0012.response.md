The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is known to be the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, the value of `added_index` will depend on the specific values of `index` and `n`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26; `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least one more character; `s` is the next character in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`.**
