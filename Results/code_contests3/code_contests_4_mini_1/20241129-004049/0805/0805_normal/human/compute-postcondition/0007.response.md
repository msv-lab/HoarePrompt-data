The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` is previously defined as `index + n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, `new_index` will be the remainder when `added_index` is divided by 26.

Since the exact values of `index` and `n` are not provided, the specific value of `new_index` cannot be calculated. However, we know that `new_index` will always fall within the range of 0 to 25 inclusive, as it is the result of the modulo operation with 26.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is the result of `added_index % 26`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
