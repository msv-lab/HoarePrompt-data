According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `strings` variable. For the loop to execute at least once, `strings` must not be an empty string. The initial state indicates that `new_strings` is empty, which does not directly affect the execution of the loop but is relevant for the eventual outcome. 

For the loop to execute, we also need to define the state of the variable `s`, which will represent the first character of the `strings` input during the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `strings` must be a non-empty string, and `s` should be the first character of `strings`.

State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `new_strings` is an empty string**
