To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `added_index` is computed as `index + n`, where `index` is the position of the character `s` in the alphabet (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', ..., 25 for 'Z'), and `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 26.
2. The new index is then calculated as `new_index = added_index % 26`. This means that `new_index` will be the result of `added_index` wrapped around if it exceeds 25, keeping it within the bounds of the alphabet.

Now, the output state will reflect the values of the variables after executing the code, specifically how `new_index` relates to `added_index`.

Since we know:
- `N` is a non-negative integer (0 <= `N` <= 26)
- `index` is the position of `s` in the alphabet
- `added_index` is `index + n`

The precise value of `new_index` will depend on the specific values of `index` and `n`, but we can state the relationships clearly.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters; `N` is a non-negative integer (0 <= `N` <= 26); `n` is an input integer; `strings` has at least one more character; `s` is the next character in `strings`; `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`; `added_index` is `index + n`; `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
