Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False, all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are False, and all elements at indices of the form 15 + 4k (where k is a non-negative integer) are set to False; if `a[3]` is True, then `a[i - 1]` is True. Since `i` is 4, this means `a[3]` is True. If `a[3]` is False, the condition does not hold.***
