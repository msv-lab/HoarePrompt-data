The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 14. The previous value of `a[14]` is `True` as it is at an even index. The other variables `a`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `a`. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True, except for `a[8]` which is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; `a[14]` is now False.**
