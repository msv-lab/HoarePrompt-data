According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` in each iteration. The value of `i` is 3, so `i ** 2 - 1` evaluates to `9 - 1`, which is 8. Thus, the loop will start from 8 and will continue as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

For the loop to execute, `j` must be initialized to the starting point of the range, which is 8 in this case. The value of `j` needs to be adjusted to be 8 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True, `i` is 3, `j` is 8 for the loop to execute the first time**
