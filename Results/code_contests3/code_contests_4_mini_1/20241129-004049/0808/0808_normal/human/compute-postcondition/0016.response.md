According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000`. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`, and continues while `j` is less than `1000000`, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 3) on each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 11. The next value of `j` for the next iteration will be `j + i`, which is `11 + 3 = 14`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `1000000`. Since `14` is significantly less than `1000000`, the loop will execute again.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True, except for `a[8]` which is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 1000000.**
