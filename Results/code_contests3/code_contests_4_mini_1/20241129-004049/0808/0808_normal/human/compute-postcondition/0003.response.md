According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the starting index calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 3 and going up to 999,999 in steps of `i`, which is 2.

Before the loop starts, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- The starting index for `j` is 3 (which is `i ** 2 - 1`).
- The loop will iterate from 3 up to 999,999.

Since `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, and the element at index `i - 1` (index 1) of `a` is True, the loop can execute as long as `j` takes valid values in the range specified.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `j` starts at 3.
- `a` contains enough elements to cover the range of the loop execution.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True; `i` is 2, `j` starts at 3**
