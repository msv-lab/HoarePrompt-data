The loop modifies the list `a` by setting certain elements to `False`, specifically those at indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8) up to 1,000,000. Given that `i` is 3, the loop will execute for indices 8, 11, 14, and so on, until it reaches the upper limit of the list.

Since `j` starts at 8 and increments by 3 on each iteration, the loop will continue until `j` reaches 999,999 (the last index in the list). The loop will execute a total of 333,334 times (the multiples of 3 starting from 8).

After all iterations:
- The list `a` will have all elements at odd indices (which are already `False`) remaining `False`, and the even indices will be `True` except for the indices that have been set to `False` during the loop execution, which are 8, 11, 14, ..., up to the last index processed.
- The final value of `j` will be 999,999, the last multiple processed.
- The value of `i` remains 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 (i.e., 8, 11, 14, ..., 999,999) are False; `i` is 3; `j` is 999999.**
