The value of `a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Since `j` is 5, the element `a[5]` is set to `False`. The previous state of `a[3]` is `False`, but it is not affected by this operation. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is `False`, `a[5]` is `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
