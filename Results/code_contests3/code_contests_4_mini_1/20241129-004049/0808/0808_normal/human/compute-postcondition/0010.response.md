Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True. If `i` is 2 and `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is True, then the loop can proceed with `j` being the last multiple of 2 processed. There is no else part in the code.***
