The code initializes a list `a` with 1,000,000 elements, all set to `True`. There are no other variables affected in this operation, and the initial state of `n` does not change. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of variable `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True; `n` remains unchanged**
