`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Since `j` is 8, we are updating the element at index 8 of the list `a`. Prior to the assignment, `a[8]` is `True` (as all elements at even indices are `True`). After the execution, `a[8]` becomes `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True, except for `a[8]` which is now `False`; `i` is 3, `j` is 8.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True, except for `a[8]` which is now `False`; `i` is 3, `j` is 8.**
