Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are False. If `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]`) is True, then the condition is satisfied and the program proceeds accordingly; since `i` is 3, this checks the value at index 2. If `a[2]` is False, there are no subsequent actions defined in the else part.***
