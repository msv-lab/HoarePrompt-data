According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 5. The starting point of the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`, which equals `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. Since `j` is currently 5, the next value of `j` will be `5 + 2 = 7`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. As `j` is currently 5, it will be increased to 7, which is still less than 1,000,000. Therefore, the loop can execute again with `j` being 7.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
