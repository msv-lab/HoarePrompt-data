The loop marks every multiple of `i` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` up to 1,000,000 as `False` in the list `a`. Since `i` is initialized to 2, the loop will execute multiple times, marking all odd indices as `False` (since even indices are already `True`).

After all iterations of the loop have finished, all multiples of 2 starting from index 3 will be marked as `False`. Specifically, all entries at odd indices will be `False`, while even indices will remain `True`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True; `i` is 2; `j` is the last multiple of 2 processed in the loop.**
