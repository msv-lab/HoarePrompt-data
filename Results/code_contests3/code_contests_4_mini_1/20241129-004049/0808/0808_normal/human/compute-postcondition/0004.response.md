The value at index `j` of list `a` is set to `False`. Since `j` is initially 3, the operation modifies `a[3]` to `False`. The other elements of the list remain unchanged, and the values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is now `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is now `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 3**
