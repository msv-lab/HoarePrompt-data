According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and the upper limit of `1000000`. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`, and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) each time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `1000000`. In this case, the next value of `j` after 8 will be `8 + 3 = 11`. Since 11 is less than `1000000`, the loop can execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will be 11. The value of `i` does not change during the loop's execution, and the state of the list `a` remains the same.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all elements at even indices are True, except for `a[8]` which is now `False`; `i` is 3, `j` is 11**
