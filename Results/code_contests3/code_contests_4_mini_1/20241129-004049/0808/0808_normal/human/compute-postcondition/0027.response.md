To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop and the initial state given.

The loop operates as follows:
- It starts from `i ** 2 - 1`, which for `i = 4` is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`, and iterates through the list `a` in steps of `i` (which is 4) until it reaches 1,000,000.
- During each iteration, it sets `a[j]` to `False` for the indices calculated.

The iterations of the loop will modify the list `a` at the indices calculated as follows:
1. **First iteration:** `j = 15`
2. **Second iteration:** `j = 19`
3. **Third iteration:** `j = 23`
4. **Fourth iteration:** `j = 27`
5. **Fifth iteration:** `j = 31`
6. **...**
7. The loop will continue until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

Since `i` is 4, the values of `j` will be every 4th index starting from 15 up to 999,999.

After all iterations of the loop have finished executing, all the elements at the calculated indices (which include 15, 19, 23, 27, ..., etc.) will be set to `False`. The overall state of the list `a` will remain unchanged for all elements not affected by the loop (those not in the calculated index set).

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is:
- `a` has all elements at odd indices as `False`.
- All even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 remain `False`.
- All calculated indices (15, 19, 23, ...) have also been set to `False`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False, all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are False, and all elements at indices of the form 15 + 4k (where k is a non-negative integer) are set to False; `i` is 4.**
