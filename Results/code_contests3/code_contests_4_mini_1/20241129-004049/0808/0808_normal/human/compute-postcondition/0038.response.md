The function `func` does not accept any parameters and is designed to identify and count prime numbers up to a given integer `n`, which is read from standard input. It first initializes a list `a` of size 1,000,000, where indices represent numbers, and sets the values to `True` for prime candidates. It then uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers as `False`. After preparing the list, the function reads integers from the input, and for each integer `n`, it counts and prints the number of prime numbers from 1 to `n`.

The function does not return any values; instead, it directly prints the results to standard output. It processes each input until EOF, and since input is taken from `sys.stdin`, it can handle multiple datasets, each specified by an integer `n` up to 999,999.

Functionality: ** The function counts and prints the number of prime numbers for each integer `n` read from standard input, where `n` can range from 1 to 999,999, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine the prime numbers. It does not return any values but prints the results directly. **
