According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3. The starting value for `j` in the next iteration is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The current value of `j` is already 3, which means it will increment by `i` (which is 2) for the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will become 5 after the current iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. After the next increment, `j` will be 5, which is still less than 1,000,000. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
