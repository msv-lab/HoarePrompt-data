According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variables `j`, and the upper limit of the range which is 1,000,000. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`, and increments `j` by `i` (which is 4) on each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 15. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. After the current iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i` (4), making the next value of `j` equal to `15 + 4 = 19`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 19 and it must be less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are False; `i` is 4; `j` is 19; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
