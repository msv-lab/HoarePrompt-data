According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the current value of `j` and the range defined by the loop. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, which means `i ** 2 - 1` equals 15. The loop starts executing from `j = 15` and increments `j` by `i` (which is 4) on each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 19. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. After the next increment, `j` will be 23 (19 + 4). Since 23 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are False, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
