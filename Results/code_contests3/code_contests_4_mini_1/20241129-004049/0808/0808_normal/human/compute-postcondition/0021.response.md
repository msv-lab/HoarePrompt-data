According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and continue to iterate with a step size of `i`. For the loop to execute a fourth time, the value of `j` must be within the bounds of the list `a`, which has a length of 1,000,000. 

Given that `i` is 4, the first iteration starts at `j = 4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`. The subsequent values of `j` will be 15, 19, 23, and then 27, which would be the fourth iteration. We also know that `a[3]` is False, but this doesn't affect the execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute four times, we need to ensure that `j` remains within the valid range of indices for the list `a` (0 to 999,999). The values of `j` for the first four iterations are 15, 19, 23, and 27, which are all valid indices.

Thus, to summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute properly:
- `i` is 4 (to allow for four iterations)
- `j` starts at 15 (which corresponds to the value of `i ** 2 - 1`)
- `a[3]` is False (as specified)

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where all elements at odd indices are False and all even indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 8 are False, `i` is 4, `j` is 15, and `a[3]` is False**
