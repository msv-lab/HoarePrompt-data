`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 7. The previous value of `a[7]` is not specified, but it will now be set to `False`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 7.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
