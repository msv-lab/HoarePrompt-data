According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `j` is 19. The starting point for the next iteration is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 15`. 

Since `j` is currently 19 and it is incremented by `i` (which is 4) in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `19 + 4 = 23`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000. Since 23 is less than 1,000,000, the loop will execute again. 

Thus, we need to state the updated values:
- `j` becomes 23.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, `a[15]` is set to `False`, `a[19]` is set to `False`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
