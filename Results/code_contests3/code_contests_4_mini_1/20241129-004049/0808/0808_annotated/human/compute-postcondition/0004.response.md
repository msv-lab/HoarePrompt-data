`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Given that `j` is 3, `a[3]` will now be `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and other elements of the array `a` (except `a[3]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, and `a[3]` is now `False` while `a[i - 1]` is true.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `a[3]` is False, and `a[i - 1]` is true.**
