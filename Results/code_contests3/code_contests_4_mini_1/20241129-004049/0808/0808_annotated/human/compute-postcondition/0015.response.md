The code assigns the value `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 11. This means that `a[11]` will now hold the value `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this assignment. The state of `a[8]` being `False` is mentioned to indicate that the loop is set to execute one more time, but it is not directly impacted by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 3; `j` is 11; `a[8]` is set to False; `a[11]` is False.**
