According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments `j` by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so `i ** 2 - 1` is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`, meaning the loop started from `j = 8`. Since `j` is currently 11, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `11 + 3 = 14`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 11, and the next value will be 14, the condition will still hold true for at least a few iterations until reaching the upper limit.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 3, `j` is 14, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
