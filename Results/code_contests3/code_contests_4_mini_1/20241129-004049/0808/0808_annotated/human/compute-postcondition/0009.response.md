To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the provided information:

1. The loop iterates starting from `j = i ** 2 - 1` up to `999999`, incrementing `j` by `i` in each iteration.
2. Since `i = 2`, the initial value of `j` will be `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`.
3. The loop continues until `j` reaches or exceeds `1000000`.
4. In each iteration, the value of `a[j]` is set to `False`.

Based on the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we observe:
- After 1 iteration: `j` is 3, `a[3]` is set to `False`.
- After 2 iterations: `j` is 5, `a[5]` is set to `False`.
- After 3 iterations: `j` is 7, `a[7]` is set to `False`.

Continuing this pattern, `j` will take values: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... up to the maximum value less than `1000000`. This forms an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers starting from 3.

The last value of `j` before exceeding `999999` will be `999999` itself (the largest odd number less than `1000000`).

At the end of the loop:
- All odd indices from 3 to 999999 in the array `a` will be set to `False`.
- Since the initial condition states that `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[1]`) is `True` and no other even indices are modified in the loop, they will remain `True`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop are completed is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `j` is 999999, `a[3]` is False, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is False, ..., `a[999999]` is False, `a[1]` is True, and all even indices remain True.**
