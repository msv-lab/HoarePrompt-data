Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 3, and `a` is an array where all even indices are True, and odd indices from `a[3]` to `a[999999]` are False. If `a[i - 1]` is True (which corresponds to `a[2]`), then `n` is an integer with all values set to True except for indices 8, 11, 14, ..., 999,992 which are set to False.***
