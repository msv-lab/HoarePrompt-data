The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 19. Since `a[15]` is already set to `False`, this change specifically affects the index `19` in the array `a`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, and `a[15]` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects the changes made to `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `j` is 19, `a[15]` is set to `False`, `a[19]` is set to `False`.**
