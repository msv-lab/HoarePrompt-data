According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. The loop index `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` for each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, which means the starting value of `j` is `4 ** 2 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15`. Since `j` is currently 15 and will increase by 4 in the next iteration, the next value of `j` will be 15 + 4 = 19. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we check if this new value of `j` (19) is still less than 1,000,000, which it is. Therefore, the loop can execute once more.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `j` is 19, and `a[15]` is set to `False` for the loop to execute a second time.**
