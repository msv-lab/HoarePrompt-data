According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the starting value of `j` (which is `i ** 2 - 1`) is less than 1,000,000. Given that `i` is currently 3, we can calculate the starting value of `j`:

1. **Calculate `j`:**
   - `j` = `i ** 2 - 1` = `3 ** 2 - 1` = `9 - 1` = `8`.

2. **Check the loop condition:**
   - The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. Since `8` is indeed less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute for the first time.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute a second time:**
   - In the loop, `j` is incremented by `i` (which is 3) each time the loop runs. Therefore, after the first iteration, `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`. 
   - For the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `j` remains less than 1,000,000 after the next increment. 

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The current state already ensures that the loop will execute at least once, and since `i` is less than 1,000,000, it will allow for multiple executions. The state of `j` after the first iteration will be `11`, which is still less than `1,000,000`.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 3, `j` is 8, for the loop to execute a second time `j` will be 11, which is less than 1,000,000.**
