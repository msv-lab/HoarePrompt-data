According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop is set to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000 and starts from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`, and increments by `i` (which is 2).

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, so we can determine the next value of `j` for the next iteration. The next value of `j` will be `5 + 2 = 7`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000, which it is at 7. Hence, the necessary state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `j` is 7, `a[3]` is False, `a[1]` is True, `a[5]` is False, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
