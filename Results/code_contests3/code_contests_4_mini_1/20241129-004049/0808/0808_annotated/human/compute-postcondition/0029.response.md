The loop starts with `i` ranging from 2 to 999,999 and eliminates multiples of each prime number found in the list `a`. The loop will execute for each `i` that is a prime number and will mark its multiples as `False` in the list `a`. After the loop completes, all non-prime indices in the list `a` will be set to `False`, and all prime indices will remain `True`. 

Given that `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, the final state of the list `a` will have `a[i]` as `True` for prime indices and `False` for non-prime indices.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is an array where `a[i]` is True if `i` is prime and False if `i` is composite for indices from 1 to 999,999.**
