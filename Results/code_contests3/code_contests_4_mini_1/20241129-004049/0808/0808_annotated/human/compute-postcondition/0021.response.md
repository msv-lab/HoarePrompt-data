According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and continues up to, but not including, `1000000`, with a step of `i`. 

Given that `i` is 4, we can calculate the starting point of the loop:
- The starting value for `j` will be `4 ** 2 - 1 = 16 - 1 = 15`.

Next, we need to ensure that the starting point is less than `1000000`, which it is (15 < 1000000). 

Since the loop will execute at least once with this starting point of `j = 15`, we don't need to adjust `n`, but we do need to note that `j` will start at 15.

State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 4, `j` is 15 for the loop to execute the first time.**
