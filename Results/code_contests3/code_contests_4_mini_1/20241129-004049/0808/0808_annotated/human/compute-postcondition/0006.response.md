The code assigns the value `False` to the element `a[j]`. Given that `j` is 5, this means that `a[5]` is set to `False`. The other variables and the previously defined values of the array `a` are not affected by this assignment. 

The state of `a[3]` remains `False`, and `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[1]`, is `True`. The elements of the array are not detailed, but we can state the known values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 2; `j` is 5; `a[3]` is False; `a[1]` is True; `a[5]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `i` is 2; `j` is 5; `a[3]` is False; `a[1]` is True; `a[5]` is False.**
