The code assigns `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is currently 7. The previous value of `a[7]` is not specified but will now be set to `False`. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `a[3]`, `a[1]`, and `a[5]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `j` is 7, `a[3]` is False, `a[1]` is True, `a[5]` is False, and `a[7]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `i` is 2, `j` is 7, `a[3]` is False, `a[1]` is True, `a[5]` is False, `a[7]` is now False**
