You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a program which reads an integer n and prints the number of prime numbers which are less than or equal to n. A prime number is a natural number which has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. For example, the first four prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5 and 7.



Input

Input consists of several datasets. Each dataset has an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) in a line.

The number of datasets is less than or equal to 30.

Output

For each dataset, prints the number of prime numbers.

Example

Input

10
3
11


Output

4
2
5
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function reads multiple datasets, each containing an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999, and the total number of datasets is less than or equal to 30.
def func():
    a = [True] * 1000000
    for i in range(2, 1000000):
        if a[i - 1]:
            for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):
                a[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999, `a` is an array where `a[i]` is True if `i` is prime and False if `i` is composite for indices from 1 to 999,999.
    for s in sys.stdin:
        print(a[1:int(s)].count(True))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 999,999; `s` is the last line of input from sys.stdin; the output for each input line is the count of prime numbers from 1 to `int(s)` based on the array `a`, where `a[i]` is True if `i` is prime and False if `i` is composite.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple datasets of integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) from standard input and counts the number of prime numbers from 1 to `n` for each input line. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers, storing the results in a boolean array `a`, where `a[i]` is True if `i` is prime. The function does not accept any parameters and directly prints the count of primes for each dataset provided until the end of input. It does not handle any edge cases explicitly, such as input errors or scenarios where `n` is outside the specified range.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
