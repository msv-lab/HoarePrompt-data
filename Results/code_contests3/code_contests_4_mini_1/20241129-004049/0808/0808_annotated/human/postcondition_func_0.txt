The function reads multiple datasets of integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999) from standard input and counts the number of prime numbers from 1 to `n` for each input line. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers, storing the results in a boolean array `a`, where `a[i]` is True if `i` is prime. The function does not accept any parameters and directly prints the count of primes for each dataset provided until the end of input. It does not handle any edge cases explicitly, such as input errors or scenarios where `n` is outside the specified range.
