The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; it reads multiple integers from input, where each integer `n` is a natural number satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. The total number of datasets is less than or equal to 30. After processing the input, the function returns output based on the provided integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple natural numbers as input, where each number satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999 and the total count of inputs is up to 30, and processes these inputs to return corresponding outputs based on the logic defined within the function.**
