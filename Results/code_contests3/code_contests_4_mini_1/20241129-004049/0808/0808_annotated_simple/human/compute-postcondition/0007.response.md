To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The previous state indicates that `i` is 2 and `j` is 5.
2. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i):`. 
   - The expression `i ** 2 - 1` evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1`, which is `4 - 1`, resulting in `3`.
   - The range becomes `range(3, 1000000, 2)`, meaning the loop will iterate starting from `3`, up to but not including `1000000`, in steps of `2`.
3. The first value of `j` in the first iteration would have been `3`, and subsequent values would be `5`, `7`, `9`, ..., continuing in steps of `2`.
4. Since `j` is currently `5`, after this iteration, the next value of `j` will be `7` for the next loop iteration.
5. The loop can continue as long as `j` is less than `1000000`.

Based on this analysis:

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with `a[3]` now being `False` and `a[5]` now being `False`; `i` is 2, `j` is 7, for the loop to execute a third time the range must be from 3 to 1000000 in steps of 2.**
