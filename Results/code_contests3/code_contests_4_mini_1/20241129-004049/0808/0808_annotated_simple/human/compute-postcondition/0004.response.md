The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`. The current value of `j` is 3, so `a[3]`, which was initially `True`, is now changed to `False`. The values of `i` and the rest of the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with `a[3]` now being `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with `a[3]` now being `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
