Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values. If the value at index `i - 1` (which is index 2) is `True`, then the condition of the if statement is satisfied. Since every third element starting from index 8 is set to `False`, it is expected that `a[2]` is `True`. There is no else part to consider.***
