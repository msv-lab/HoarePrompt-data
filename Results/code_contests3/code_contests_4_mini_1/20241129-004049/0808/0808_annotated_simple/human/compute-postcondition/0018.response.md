Given that the loop executes for values of `j` starting from \(i^2 - 1\) (which is \(3^2 - 1 = 8\)) and increments by `i` (which is 3), we can deduce the following:

- The values of `j` during the iterations will be as follows:
  - 1st iteration: `j` = 8
  - 2nd iteration: `j` = 11
  - 3rd iteration: `j` = 14
  - This pattern continues, incrementing `j` by 3 each time.

The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. We can calculate how many times the loop will run in total. The last valid value for `j` can be calculated as follows:

1. The initial value of `j` is 8.
2. The maximum value of `j` before it exceeds 1,000,000 can be calculated by the formula:
   \[
   j = 8 + 3 \times n < 1000000
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   3n < 999992 \implies n < 333330.67
   \]
   Thus, the maximum integer `n` is 333330.

This means that the loop will execute \(n + 1 = 333331\) times, resulting in values of `j` from 8 up to:
\[
j = 8 + 3 \times 333330 = 1000000
\]
At this point, the loop stops because `j` is no longer less than 1,000,000.

During each iteration, the corresponding index in the list `a` is set to `False`. The indices that are modified in list `a` are:
- 8, 11, 14, ..., 999997.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will reflect that indices starting from 8 and every third index thereafter up to 999997 have been set to `False`, while all other indices remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with every third element starting from index 8 set to `False`, `i` is 3.**
