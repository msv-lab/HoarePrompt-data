According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `i`. The range for the loop is calculated as `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. Given that `i` is currently 3, the starting point of the loop is `3 ** 2 - 1`, which equals `8`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 8 and incrementing by 3 until it reaches or exceeds 1,000,000.

To ensure that the loop executes a third time, we need to analyze the values of `j` during the iterations:

1. The first value of `j` will be 8.
2. The second value of `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`.
3. The third value of `j` will be `11 + 3 = 14`.

For the loop to execute a third time, we need to ensure that the loop has started executing and that the values of `j` align with the condition specified. Additionally, the state mentions that the value at index 2 in list `a` must be `True`, which is a condition that needs to be met before the loop begins executing.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- Ensure that `a[2]` is `True` to meet the specified condition.
- The value of `j` must be initialized correctly, starting from 8.

State: **`a[2]` is `True`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8 for the loop to execute the first time, the second time `j` is 11, and for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 14.**
