The value at index `j` of the list `a` is assigned `False`. Since `j` is 5, `a[5]` will change from `True` to `False`. The other values in the list and the variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with `a[3]` now being `False` and `a[5]` now being `False`; `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with `a[3]` now being `False` and `a[5]` now being `False`; `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
