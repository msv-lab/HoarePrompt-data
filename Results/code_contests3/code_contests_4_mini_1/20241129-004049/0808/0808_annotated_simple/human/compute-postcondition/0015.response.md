The value of `a[j]` is assigned `False`. Since `j` is 11, the value `a[11]` will now be set to `False`. The previous state of `a[11]` is not specified, but it is affected by this assignment. The values of `a[8]`, `i`, and all other elements of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a[11]`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11**
