`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, and since `j` is 8, the value at index 8 of the list `a` (which originally contains 1,000,000 values) is changed from its previous value to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8**
