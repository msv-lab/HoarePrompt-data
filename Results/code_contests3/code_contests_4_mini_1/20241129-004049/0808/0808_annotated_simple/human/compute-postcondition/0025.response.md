According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 11. The next value of `j` is calculated by adding `i` (which is 3) to the current value of `j`. Thus, the next value of `j` would be 11 + 3 = 14. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than 1000000. Since 14 is less than 1000000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a[2]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is 14, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 1000000**
