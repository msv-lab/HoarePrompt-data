According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the current value of `j` is less than 1000000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 8. The next value of `j` will be calculated based on the loop's progression. 

The loop starts at `j = i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i`, which is 3. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1000000.

State: **`a[2]` is `True`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1000000**
