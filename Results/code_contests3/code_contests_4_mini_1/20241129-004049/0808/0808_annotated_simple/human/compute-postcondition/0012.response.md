According to the code, the loop will execute based on the initial value of `j`, which is determined by the expression `i ** 2 - 1`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000 and will increment `j` by `i` in each iteration. 

To execute the loop for the third time, we need to ensure that the initial value of `j` is set up correctly and that the loop continues to execute until the third iteration:

1. The value of `j` starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`.
2. In the first iteration, `j` will be `8`.
3. In the second iteration, `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`.
4. In the third iteration, `j` will be `11 + 3 = 14`.

For the loop to execute a third time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000 after the second iteration. Since `i` is currently set to 3, it satisfies the condition for the loop to run multiple times.

Thus, the necessary states before the loop starts would be: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values, `i` is 3, `j` is 8 (the value of `j` at the start of the first iteration). 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values, `i` is 3, `j` is 8 for the loop to execute the first time**.
