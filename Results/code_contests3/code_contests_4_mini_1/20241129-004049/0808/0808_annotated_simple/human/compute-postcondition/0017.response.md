The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, and `j` is 14, so `a[14]` is now `False`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` set to `False`, `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` set to `False`, `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
