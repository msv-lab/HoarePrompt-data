According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 3) on each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 11. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `i`, resulting in `j` becoming 14. Since 14 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `a[11]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 14**
