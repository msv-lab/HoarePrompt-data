Functionality: ** The function reads multiple natural numbers from input (each between 1 and 999,999) and, for each input number, it counts and prints the number of prime numbers less than or equal to that input. It first generates a list indicating which numbers up to 999,999 are prime using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a valid natural number within the specified range or when there are more than 30 inputs. **
