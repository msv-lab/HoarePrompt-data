According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1,000,000 in steps of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 8. The starting point for the loop is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. Since `j` is currently 8, the loop will execute while `j` is less than 1,000,000.

To determine the value of `j` for the next iteration, we need to add `i` (which is 3) to `j`. Therefore, `j` will be updated to `8 + 3 = 11`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since 11 is less than 1,000,000, the loop can indeed execute once more.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 values with `a[8]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 11**
