The value of `j` is 8 for the first execution of the loop. The statement `a[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to `a[8]`. The state of `a[2]` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[2]` is `True`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8, and `a[8]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`a[2]` is `True`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8, and `a[8]` is now `False`**
