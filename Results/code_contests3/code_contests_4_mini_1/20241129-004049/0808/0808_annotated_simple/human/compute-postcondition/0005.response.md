According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `i` as 2 and `j` as 3. The loop starts at `i ** 2 - 1`, which is 2 ** 2 - 1 = 3, and increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) in each iteration. Since `j` is currently 3, it will increase by 2 for the next iteration, resulting in `j` becoming 5.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000. The next value of `j` will be 5, which is still less than 1,000,000.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 `True` values with `a[3]` now being `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
