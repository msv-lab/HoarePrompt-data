The function does not accept any parameters and continuously reads an integer `n` from the user input. It decrements `n` until it reaches zero and for each positive value of `n`, it prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of integers from 1 to `n - 1`. If the input is not a valid integer, it may lead to unexpected behavior since the code does not handle non-integer inputs. The function does not return any value.
