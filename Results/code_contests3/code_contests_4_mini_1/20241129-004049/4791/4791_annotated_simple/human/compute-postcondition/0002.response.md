`n` is decremented by 1. The value of `N` is between 2 and 500, which means `n` must have been at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time. After this operation, `n` will be at least 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a non-empty string decreased by 1 (which will result in a new integer value).

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a non-empty string decreased by 1.**
