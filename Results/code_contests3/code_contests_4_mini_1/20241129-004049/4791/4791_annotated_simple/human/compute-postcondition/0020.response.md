The value of `n` is decremented by 1, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the new value of `n` will still be greater than or equal to 0. The variable `j`, which is defined as `n - 1`, will also change as a result of the decrement of `n`. The previous value of `j` was `n - 1`, and after decrementing `n`, `j` will now be `n - 1 - 1`, or simply `n - 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (now decremented by 1); `j` is `n - 2`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (now decremented by 1); `j` is `n - 2`**
