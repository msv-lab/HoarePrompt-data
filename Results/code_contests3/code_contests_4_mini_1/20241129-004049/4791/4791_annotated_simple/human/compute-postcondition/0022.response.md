The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

Given that `j` is initially 0, we can calculate:

1. `j + 1` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.
2. The binary representation of `1` is `'0b1'`, and slicing off the `'0b'` part gives us `'1'`.
3. Reversing `'1'` results in `'1'`.
4. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is found at index `0`.
5. Adding `1` to this index gives us `0 + 1`, resulting in `1`.

The other variables (`N` and `n`) are not affected by this operation, and their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
