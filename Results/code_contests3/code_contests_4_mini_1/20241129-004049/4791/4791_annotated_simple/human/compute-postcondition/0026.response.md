The value of `j` is 2. The expression `j + 1` calculates to 3. The `bin(3)` function converts this to a binary string representation, which is `'0b11'`. The slicing `[::-1]` reverses this string to `'11b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1', which is at index 0. Finally, adding 1 gives us a result of 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
