The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, after this operation, `n` will still remain a positive integer. The value of `j`, which is defined as `n - 1`, will now be updated to reflect the new value of `n`. Therefore, the output state will be: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1, `j` is now `n - 1` (which is one less than the updated `n`).

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and is now decremented by 1, `j` is now `n - 1.**
