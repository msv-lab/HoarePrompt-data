According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1. Since `n` is still greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
