The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` computes as follows:

1. `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.
2. `bin(3)` converts the integer 3 to its binary representation, which is '0b11'.
3. Reversing this string gives us '11b0'.
4. The `find('1')` method looks for the first occurrence of '1' in '11b0', which is at index 0.
5. Adding 1 to the index found gives us 0 + 1 = 1.

The result from the `print` statement is therefore `1`. Since we initially stated that the result from the print statement is 2, this indicates a misunderstanding as the correct calculation yields 1.

The states of other variables (`N`, `n`) are unaffected by the print statement.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the print statement outputs 1.**
