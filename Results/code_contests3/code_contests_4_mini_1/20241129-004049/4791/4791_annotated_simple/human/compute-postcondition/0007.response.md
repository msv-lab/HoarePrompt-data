According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement will be 2.**
