According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since the result of the print statement is 1, it indicates that the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

After the last iteration, `j` would be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, since `j` is now 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 1**
