According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `n` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, which means it is not zero. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and the results of the print statements are the integers from 1 to at most `n`.**
