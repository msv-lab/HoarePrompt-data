The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

Given the initial state where `j` is 1:
1. We first calculate `j + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`.
3. Reversing `10` gives us `01`.
4. The `find('1')` method locates the first occurrence of '1' in `01`, which is at index `1` (0-based indexing).
5. Adding 1 to the index value gives us `1 + 1 = 2`.

The values of `N` and `n` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.**
