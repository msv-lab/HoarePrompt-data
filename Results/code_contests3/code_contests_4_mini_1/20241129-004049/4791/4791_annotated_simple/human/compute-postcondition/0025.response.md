According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and the print statement output is 2, which implies that `j` was incremented from 1 to 2 during the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented again, making it 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2, since `j` will be 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2**
