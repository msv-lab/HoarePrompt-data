`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take an input value as a string. The value of `N` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string. 
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.**
