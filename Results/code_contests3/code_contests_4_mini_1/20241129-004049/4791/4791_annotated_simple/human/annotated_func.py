#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the output contains the sequence of integers corresponding to the first positions of '1' in the binary representations of integers from 1 to the initial value of `N - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and continuously reads an integer `n` from the user input. It decrements `n` until it reaches zero and for each positive value of `n`, it prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of integers from 1 to `n - 1`. If the input is not a valid integer, it may lead to unexpected behavior since the code does not handle non-integer inputs. The function does not return any value.
