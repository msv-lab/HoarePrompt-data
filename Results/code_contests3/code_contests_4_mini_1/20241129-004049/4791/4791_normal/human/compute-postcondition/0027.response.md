To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can observe that the loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer. The loop itself prints the position of the least significant '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1` (1-indexed). 

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can infer the following:

- After 1 iteration, `j` is 0 and prints 1.
- After 2 iterations, `j` is 1 and prints 2.
- After 3 iterations, `j` is 2 and prints 1.

From this, we can see that the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The value of `j` will range from 0 to `n - 1`. 

If `n` is converted from a non-empty string to an integer, after all iterations:
- `j` will be at its maximum value, which is `n - 1`.
- The printed outputs will range from 1 up to the value of `n`, depending on the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to `n`.

Considering the final state of `j`, it will be `n - 1` after the loop completes.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and the printed outputs are the positions of the least significant '1' from 1 to `n`.**
