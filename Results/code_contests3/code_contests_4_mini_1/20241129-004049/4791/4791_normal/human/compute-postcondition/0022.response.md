The value of `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`, and reversing this gives `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'`, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this gives a final result of 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
