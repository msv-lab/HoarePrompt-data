According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is non-empty (i.e., it evaluates to True), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, which means it is still true that it is a non-empty string. 

Since `n` is non-empty, it can still execute one more time without needing any adjustments. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
