`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input in string format. The previous value of `N` is not affected by this operation, and `n` now holds a string representation of whatever input is provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is a string input**
