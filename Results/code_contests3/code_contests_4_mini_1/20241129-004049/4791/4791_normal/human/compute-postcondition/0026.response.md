The code computes the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The binary representation of `3` is `11`. Then, it reverses this string to get `11` (which remains the same when reversed) and finds the index of the first occurrence of '1'. The index is `0`, and adding `1` results in `1`.

The values of the other variables `N` and `n` remain unchanged and are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and the expression evaluates to `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and the expression evaluates to 1.**
