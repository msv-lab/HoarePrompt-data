`n` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, which implies that when converted to an integer, it must be at least 1. Therefore, the value of `n` will become a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0 (since we are decrementing it). The value of `j` is also affected since `j` is defined as `n - 1`, but we need to compute `j` after the decrement of `n`.

After executing the code, `n` will represent an integer value that is one less than its previous integer value, and `j` will represent this new value of `n` minus 1. Therefore, `j` will be `n - 1` after the decrement.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `j` is `n - 1` (after decrementing `n`)**
