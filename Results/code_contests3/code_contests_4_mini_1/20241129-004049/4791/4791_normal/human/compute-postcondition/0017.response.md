The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses that binary string, and then adds 1 to the index of the first occurrence of '1'. 

First, we calculate `j + 1`:
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.

Next, we find the binary representation of 3:
- The binary representation of 3 is `11`.

Then, we reverse this binary string:
- The reversed binary string is `11` (since reversing `11` gives `11`).

Now we find the index of the first '1':
- In this reversed string `11`, the first occurrence of '1' is at index 0.

Finally, we add 1 to this index:
- Index 0 + 1 = 1.

The values of `N`, `n`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
