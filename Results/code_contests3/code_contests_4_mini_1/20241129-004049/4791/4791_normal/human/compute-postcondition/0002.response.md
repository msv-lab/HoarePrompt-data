`n` is decremented by 1. The value of `N` was initially an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), so after the operation, `n` will be one less than its previous value. The specifics of `n` are not provided, but it will be adjusted accordingly. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string decremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string decremented by 1.**
