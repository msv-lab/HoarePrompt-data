`n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, the value of `n` will now represent an integer that is one less than its previous value. The variable `j` is not directly affected by this operation in terms of reassignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is now a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1 after being decremented by 1, and `j` remains `n - 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is now a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1 after being decremented by 1, `j` remains `n - 1`.**
