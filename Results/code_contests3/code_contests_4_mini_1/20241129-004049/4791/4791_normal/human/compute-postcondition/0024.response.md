The line of code prints the result of the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1`. The variable `j` is initialized to 1. 

First, we calculate `j + 1`:
- Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` equals 2.

Next, we convert `2` to its binary representation:
- The binary representation of `2` is `'10'`.

Then, we reverse this string:
- The reversed string is `'01'`.

Now, we find the index of the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string:
- In `'01'`, the first occurrence of `'1'` is at index `1`.

Finally, we add `1` to this index:
- Therefore, `1 + 1` equals `2`.

The other variables, `N` and `n`, remain unaffected by this operation. 

Thus, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the printed output is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and the printed output is 2.**
