The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated. 

1. The value of `j` is 1. Therefore, `j + 1` equals 2.
2. The binary representation of 2 is `10`.
3. Reversing `10` gives `01`.
4. The `find('1')` method looks for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `01`, which is at index 1.
5. Adding 1 to the result from `find` gives `1 + 1 = 2`.

No other variables are affected, so the output state remains unchanged for `N`, `n`, and `j`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.**
