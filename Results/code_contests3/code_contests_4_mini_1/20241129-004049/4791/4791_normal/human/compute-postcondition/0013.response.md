The code snippet calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses that string, and then finds the index of '1'. The value of `j` is 0, so:

1. `j + 1` is evaluated to `1`.
2. The binary representation of `1` is `'0b1'`, and stripping the `'0b'` prefix gives `'1'`.
3. Reversing `'1'` still results in `'1'`.
4. Finding the index of the first '1' in `'1'` gives `0`, and adding `1` to that results in `1`.

Therefore, after execution, the output state will reflect that the print statement outputs `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is now a non-empty string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
