The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that a variable `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Based on this input, the function will produce an output, but the specific output behavior is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with a predefined integer variable `N` that is constrained between 2 and 500. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with an integer N between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
