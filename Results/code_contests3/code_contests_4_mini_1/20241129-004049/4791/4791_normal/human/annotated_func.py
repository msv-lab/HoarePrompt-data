#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an empty string after all iterations, `j` is -1, and the printed outputs are the positions of the least significant '1' for each integer from 1 to the initial value of `N - 1` (for `N` iterations).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for input. It expects an integer `n` (which should be between 2 and 500 inclusive) and then prints the position of the least significant '1' bit for each integer from 1 to `n-1`. The function continues until `n` becomes empty, at which point the loop will exit. However, since `n` is taken as a string input, the loop as currently implemented will not function correctly because it attempts to subtract 1 from a string. This results in a TypeError and the function will not complete successfully. Therefore, the function does not execute as intended due to this type mismatch.
