#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, the printed output consists of the positions of the least significant bits set to `1` for numbers from 1 to the original value of `N - 1`, and `j` is `n - 1`, which is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input. It then prints the positions of the least significant bits set to `1` for all integers from `1` to `n-1`. The function continues to decrement `n` until it reaches `0`, but since there is no termination condition based on user input, it may result in an infinite loop if `n` is not initially set correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a valid integer, which could lead to an error.
