The value of `j` is 1. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `2`. The `bin` function converts `2` to its binary representation, which is `'0b10'`. The slice `bin(j + 1)[::-1]` reverses this string to `'01b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in this reversed string, which is at index `1`. Adding `1` to this index gives `2`. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is at least 5, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the output is 2.

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 1, and the output is 2**.
