The code prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. The initial value of `j` is 0, so `j + 1` equals 1. The binary representation of 1 is '1'. Reversing '1' still gives '1', and the position of the first '1' is 0 (0-based index). Adding 1 to this gives a final result of 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2 before decrement, `j` is 0 and the output of the print statement is 1.**
