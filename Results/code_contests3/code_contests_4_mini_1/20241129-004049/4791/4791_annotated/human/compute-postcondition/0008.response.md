The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated as follows:

1. First, `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.
2. The binary representation of 3 is `0b11`, which is `11` when the `0b` prefix is ignored.
3. Reversing the string `11` results in `11` (since it reads the same forwards and backwards).
4. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `11`, which is at index 0.
5. Finally, we add 1 to the index found, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the printed output is `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the printed output is 1.**
