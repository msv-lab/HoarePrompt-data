The code executes the statement `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)`. 

Step by step:

1. The value of `j` is 0.
2. Therefore, `j + 1` equals 1.
3. The `bin` function converts 1 into its binary representation, which is `'0b1'`.
4. The string `[:: -1]` reverses this binary string, resulting in `'1b0'`.
5. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `'1b0'`, which is at index 0.
6. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1.

Thus, the output state reflects that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 0, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
