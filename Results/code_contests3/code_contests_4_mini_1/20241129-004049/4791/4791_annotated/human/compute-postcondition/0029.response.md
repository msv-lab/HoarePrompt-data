The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate within the constraints that an integer `N` is between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Based on these constraints, the function will return output specific to the value of `N`. However, since the exact output is not specified in the provided details, we can only describe the functionality related to the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates within the constraints that an integer N is between 2 and 500 (inclusive).**
