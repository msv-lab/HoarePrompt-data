According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the integer `n`. Since `j` is currently 0, and the loop will increment `j` by 1 for each iteration, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `N` is between 2 and 500, which means `n` (or `N`) is greater than 0. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
