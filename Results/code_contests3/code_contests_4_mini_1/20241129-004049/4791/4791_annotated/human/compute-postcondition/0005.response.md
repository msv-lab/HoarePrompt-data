According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2 before decrementing. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `j` will be 1 and we need `j < n`).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2 before decrement, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
