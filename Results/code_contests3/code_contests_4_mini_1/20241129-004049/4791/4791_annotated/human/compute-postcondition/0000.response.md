`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take input from the user as a string. The original value of `N` does not change as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `n` is an input string**.
