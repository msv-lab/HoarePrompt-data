Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input. It then prints the positions of the least significant bits set to `1` for all integers from `1` to `n-1`. The function continues to decrement `n` until it reaches `0`, but since there is no termination condition based on user input, it may result in an infinite loop if `n` is not initially set correctly. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a valid integer, which could lead to an error. **
