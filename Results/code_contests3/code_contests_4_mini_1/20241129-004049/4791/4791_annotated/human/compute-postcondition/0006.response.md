The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` calculates the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

Given that `j` is 1, we first compute `j + 1` which equals 2. The binary representation of 2 is `'10'`. When reversed, it becomes `'01'`. The method `find('1')` searches for the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string, which is at index 1 (0-based index). Adding 1 to this index gives us a result of 2.

The other variables `N` and `n` remain unaffected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2 before decrement, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is at least 2 before decrement, `j` is 1, output is 2**
