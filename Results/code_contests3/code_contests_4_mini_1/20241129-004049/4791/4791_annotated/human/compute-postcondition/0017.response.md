`j + 1` evaluates to `3`, and `bin(3)` gives the binary string representation `'0b11'`. Reversing this string results in `'11b0'`. The `.find('1')` method then locates the first occurrence of `'1'`, which is at index `0`. Adding `1` to this index gives `1`. Thus, the output of the `print` statement is `1`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is at least 5, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and the output is 1.**
