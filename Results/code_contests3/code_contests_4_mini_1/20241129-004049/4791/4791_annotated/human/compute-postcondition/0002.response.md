`n` is decremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, but it does not provide the specific value of `n`. We know that `n` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute the first time, but since we are decrementing `n`, we can infer that `n` is currently a valid integer derived from that string representation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` has been decreased by 1. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is decremented by 1.**
