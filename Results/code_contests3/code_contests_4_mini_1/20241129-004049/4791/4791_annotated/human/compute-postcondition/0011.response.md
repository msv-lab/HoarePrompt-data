The value of `n` is decremented by 1, which means that if `n` was the original value minus 1, it will now be the original value minus 2. The other variables `N` and `j` remain unchanged; however, `j`, which is defined as `n - 1`, will also change based on the new value of `n`. Therefore, after this operation, `j` will be `n - 1`, which is now the original value minus 3. 

The output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is the original value minus 2; `j` is the original value minus 3.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `n` is the original value minus 2; `j` is the original value minus 3.**
