To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze how the loop processes the variable `j` and the implications of the range defined by `n`.

Given that `n` is the original value minus 3, the loop iterates `n` times (from `0` to `n-1`).

1. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is always a non-negative integer since `N` is between 2 and 500.
2. During each iteration, the print statement outputs the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, starting from the least significant bit (rightmost). 
3. The output is always `1` for `j = 0` and `j = 1` (binary `1` and `10` respectively), and `2` for `j = 2` (binary `11`). For higher values of `j`, the output will continue to reflect the position of the first '1' in the binary representation.

After the loop executes `n` times, the last value of `j` will be `n-1`.

- If `n` is `1`, the loop does not execute, and `j` will remain `0`.
- If `n` is `2`, the loop executes once with `j` as `0`, and the output is `1`.
- If `n` is `3`, the loop executes twice with `j` as `1`, and the output is still `1`.
- If `n` is `4`, the loop executes three times with `j` values `0`, `1`, and `2`, and the outputs are `1`, `1`, and `2` respectively.

The maximum value for `n` would be `497` (since `N` can be up to `500`), resulting in `j` ranging from `0` to `496`. The outputs will vary based on the binary representation of `j + 1`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes `n` times will be:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `j` is `n-1`, and the output of the print statements is a series of integers corresponding to the positions of the first '1' in the binary representations of integers from `1` to `n`.**
