The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the value of `tem`. The initial state provides that `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` (which is greater than or equal to `n`) or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the minimum operation will yield either the existing value of `ans` or `tem`, whichever is smaller.

Thus, if `tem` is valid and less than `ans`, `ans` will take the value of `tem`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` now holds the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`**
