According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will execute for each combination of '7' and '4' with a length of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has not executed yet, and the first iteration will generate combinations of length 0 (the empty combination).

Since the loop must repeat for `i` to increase, we will adjust `i` to 1 for the next execution, which will allow the loop to generate combinations of length 1 (either '7' or '4').

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `x` must be a combination of length 1 from '74'.**
