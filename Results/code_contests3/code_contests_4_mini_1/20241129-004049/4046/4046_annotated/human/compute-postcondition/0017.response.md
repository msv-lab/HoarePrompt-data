Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is a positive integer less than 10; `i` is 1; if `x.count('7')` is equal to `x.count('4')`, then `tem` is either 7 or 4, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
