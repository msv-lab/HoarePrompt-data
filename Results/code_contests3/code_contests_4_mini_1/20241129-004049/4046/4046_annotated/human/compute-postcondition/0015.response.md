The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` can either be 7 or 4. Since `ans` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value, but we can state that it has been compared with `tem`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `ans` is updated based on the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is a positive integer less than 10; `i` is 1; `tem` is either 7 or 4; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
