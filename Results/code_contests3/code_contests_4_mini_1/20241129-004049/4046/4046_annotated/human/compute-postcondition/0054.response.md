Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 11; `tem` is an integer representation of a string made up of the digits '7' and '4' repeated 11 times. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its previous value and `tem`.***
