Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x' and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, no changes are made to `ans`.***
