According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which starts at `l` and increments by 2 in each iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must remain less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `l`, and since `l` is a positive integer less than 10, the next value of `i` will be `l + 2`. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `l` must be less than or equal to 8 (since the next value would be `l + 2`, which should be less than 10). Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be `l + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` that is greater than or equal to `n` based on the combinations of '4's and '7's, or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be `l + 2` and `l` must be less than or equal to 8.**
