`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` can be either 7 or 4, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, while `l` is a positive integer less than 10. The impact on `ans` depends on its initial value and the value of `tem`. Since we do not have the initial value of `ans`, we cannot determine its updated value precisely. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `tem` is either 7 or 4; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`tem` is either 7 or 4; `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
