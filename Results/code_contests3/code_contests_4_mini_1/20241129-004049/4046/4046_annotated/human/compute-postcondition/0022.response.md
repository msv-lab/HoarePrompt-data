Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `tem` is either 7 or 4. If `x.count('7')` is equal to `x.count('4')`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, there are no updates to `ans`. Otherwise, if the counts of '7' and '4' are not equal, there are no changes made to `ans`.***
