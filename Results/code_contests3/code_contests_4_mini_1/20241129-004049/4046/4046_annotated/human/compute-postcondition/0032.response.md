According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop will run for the next combination of `x` generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`, and `i` is incremented by 2 in the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 10, and it will be increased by 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to its new value, which will be `i + 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is less than 10, the new value of `i` will be at least 2 (if it started at 0) and at most 10 (if it started at 8). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem` if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is updated to a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10, and for the loop to execute again, `i` will be at least 2 and less than or equal to 10.**
