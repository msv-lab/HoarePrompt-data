To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its effects on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `tem` is being assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. This means that `x` is a sequence of characters (most likely a list or string) that is being joined together into a single string and then converted into an integer.
2. We know from the initial state that `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` that is greater than or equal to `n`. This implies that the value of `tem` should be at least equal to `n`.
3. The details of `x` are not provided, but we know that the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`. Without more specific information about `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`.
4. The impact on other variables (`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`) is not directly affected by this line of code.

Since we cannot derive an exact value for `tem` without additional information regarding `x`, we can only conclude that `tem` has been computed as an integer based on the joined characters of `x`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is less than 10 and will be incremented by 2 in the next iteration, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`.**
