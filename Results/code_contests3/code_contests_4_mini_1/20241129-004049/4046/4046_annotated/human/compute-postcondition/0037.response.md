According to the code, the loop iterates over the Cartesian product of '7' and '4' repeated `i` times. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 from its current value at the end of the last iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x'` and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, resulting in an update to `ans`. The loop can execute again if `i` is incremented.

Since `l` is a positive integer less than 10, the maximum value for `i` is limited by this condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 and thus `i` will be `i + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`**
