Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is 10, `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found, `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
