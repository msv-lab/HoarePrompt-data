Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is less than 10 and will be incremented by 2 in the next iteration, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`.***
