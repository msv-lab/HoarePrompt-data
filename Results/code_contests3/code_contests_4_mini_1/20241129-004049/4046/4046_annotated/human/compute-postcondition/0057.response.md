The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state and there is no context provided for what `x` contains, we cannot determine a specific value for `tem`. The other variables `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unaffected as no operations involve them.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 11; and `tem` is an integer formed by joining the elements of `x`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 11; and `tem` is an integer formed by joining the elements of `x`, which is undefined.**
