Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is 10, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. There is no else part in the code.***
