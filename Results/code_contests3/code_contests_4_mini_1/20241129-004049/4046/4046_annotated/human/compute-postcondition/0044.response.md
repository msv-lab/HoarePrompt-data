According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be `l + 2` and `l` must be less than or equal to 8. Given that `l` is a positive integer less than 10, the maximum value for `l` can be 8. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer (which does not directly affect the loop execution), `l` is a positive integer, and `ans` is determined based on combinations of '4's and '7's. 

For the loop to execute a second time:
1. `l` must be less than or equal to 8.
2. `i` must be `l + 2`.

Thus, to ensure the loop can run a second time, we can set `l` to any value from 1 to 8, and based on that, `i` will be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8 (for example, `l` is 8), `i` is `l + 2` (thus `i` is 10), `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found**
