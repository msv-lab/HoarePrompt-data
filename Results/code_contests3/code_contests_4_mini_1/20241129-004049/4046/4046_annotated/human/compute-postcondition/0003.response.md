`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, and since `l` is an odd number, after the increment, `l` will be an even number. The value of `ans` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10); `ans` is 4444477777.
