Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 11; if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem`, an integer formed by joining the elements of `x`, is checked, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.***
