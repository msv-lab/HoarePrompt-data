In the given code snippet, `x` is formed by repeating the characters '7' and '4' a total of 11 times. Since `i` is 11, `x` would be a string that contains '7' and '4' repeated in some combination. The expression `''.join(x)` converts the list `x` into a single string. The `int()` function then converts this string representation of a number into an integer.

However, the exact combination of '7' and '4' is not specified in the initial state, so `tem` will be an integer representation of a string of length 11 made up of the digits '7' and '4'.

Since `n` is a positive integer and does not directly influence the value of `tem`, and `l` is less than or equal to 8 while `i` is fixed at 11, the output state reflects the assignment of `tem` based on the repetitive character pattern.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is 11, `tem` is an integer representation of a string made up of the digits '7' and '4' repeated 11 times.**
