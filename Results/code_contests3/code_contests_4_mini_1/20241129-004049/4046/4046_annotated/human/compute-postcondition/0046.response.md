The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. Since the initial state indicates that the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, but does not provide the actual content of `x`, we cannot determine a specific integer for `tem`. Therefore, the previous values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by the assignment to `tem`. 

Thus, the output state accounts for the assignment and the unchanged values of other variables. The output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is 10, `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found, and `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))` where `x` is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is 10, `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found, `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`.**
