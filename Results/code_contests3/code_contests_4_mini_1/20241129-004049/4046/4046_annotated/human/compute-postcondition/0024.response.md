According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from `l` to 10 with a step of 2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value calculated from `l`, which is less than 10. Since `l` is a positive integer less than 10, the next value of `i` for the loop will be `i + 2`. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 10. Therefore, if `l` were, for example, 8, the next value of `i` would be 10, causing the loop to terminate. However, since `l` is less than 10, the next increment would keep `i` valid for loop execution.

Thus, if `l` is 8, the next `i` would be 10, which is not valid for execution. Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute at least one more time, `l` must be such that after adding 2 to the current `i`, it still remains less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is a positive integer less than 10; `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` that is greater than or equal to `n` for all valid combinations of `x` where the count of '7' equals the count of '4', or remains 4444477777 if no valid `tem` was found; for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 10, and the next value of `i` will be `i + 2`.**
