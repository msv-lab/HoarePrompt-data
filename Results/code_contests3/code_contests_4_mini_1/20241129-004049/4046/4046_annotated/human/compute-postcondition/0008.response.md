The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The operation `''.join(x)` combines the elements of `x` into a single string, and then `int()` converts that string into an integer. The input conditions specify that `n` is a positive integer, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `i` is 0, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x'. However, the specific value of `x` is not provided, and its elements are not specified, so the exact value of `tem` cannot be determined. 

Since `x` is not explicitly defined, we cannot provide its value or the value of `tem`. The output state will reflect that `tem` is assigned but cannot specify its value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `i` is 0; `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))` but cannot be determined without the specific value of `x`.**
