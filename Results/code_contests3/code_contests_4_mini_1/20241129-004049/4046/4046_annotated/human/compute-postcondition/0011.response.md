Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is a positive integer less than 10; `i` is 0; `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
