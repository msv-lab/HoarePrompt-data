The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the initial state, which means its value is unknown. Therefore, we cannot determine the value of `tem`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, `i` is incremented to `i + 1, and `tem` is assigned an unknown value due to `x` being undefined.**
