Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is `l + 2` (thus `i` is 10), `ans` is either the minimum valid `tem` greater than or equal to `n` or `4444477777` if no valid `tem` was found. The count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`.***
