Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is a positive integer less than 10, and `i` is 0. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
