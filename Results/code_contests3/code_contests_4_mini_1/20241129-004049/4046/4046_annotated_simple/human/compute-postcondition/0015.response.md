The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `tem`. The specific values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, but `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`, where `i` is `l + 1`. Therefore, the output state indicates that the value of `ans` has been modified based on the comparison with `tem`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`, and `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, `tem`).**
