The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. Here, `x` is a combination of the characters '7' and '4' generated to a length of `i`, which is `l + 1`. The specific value of `tem` will depend on the actual combination of '7' and '4' that is joined into a string and then converted to an integer. Since the initial state does not provide the specific combinations generated in `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `tem` has been assigned an integer value based on the joining of the characters.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`.**
