The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `tem`. The value of `tem` is formed from combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, while `ans` is the minimum integer formed by such combinations of the same length. Since `ans` is being compared with `tem`, the potential values of `ans` could be either unchanged or updated to a new minimum value based on `tem`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, `tem` is the integer formed from the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`**.
