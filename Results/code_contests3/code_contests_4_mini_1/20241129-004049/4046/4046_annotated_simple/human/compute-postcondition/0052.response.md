The value of `x` is a string formed by combining '7's and '4's of length `i`. The code converts this string to an integer and assigns it to `tem`. Therefore, `tem` will be an integer representation of the combination in `x`. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, `tem` is the integer formed from `x`.**
