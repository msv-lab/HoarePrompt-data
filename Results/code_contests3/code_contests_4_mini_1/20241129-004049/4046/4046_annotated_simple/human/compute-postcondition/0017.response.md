Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
