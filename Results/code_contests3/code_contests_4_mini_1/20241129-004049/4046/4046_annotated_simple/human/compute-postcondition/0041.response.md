Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer less than 10; `i` is `l + 2`; if `x` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` (the integer representation of `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
