Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer less than 10; `i` is `l + 2`; if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`; `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`, and `tem` is the integer representation of `x`.***
