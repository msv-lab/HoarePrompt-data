Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l`, and if the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x', then `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
