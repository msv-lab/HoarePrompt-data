The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the value of `tem`. The previous values of `ans` and `tem` are not specified, but `ans` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is an integer formed by joining the characters in `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the comparison of these two values. 

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `tem`**
