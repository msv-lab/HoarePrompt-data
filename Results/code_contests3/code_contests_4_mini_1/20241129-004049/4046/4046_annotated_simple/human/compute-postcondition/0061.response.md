Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, and `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i` where the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's and `ans` is greater than or equal to `n`, or remains unchanged if no valid combination meets the criteria.**
