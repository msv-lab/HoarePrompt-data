Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, and `tem` is the integer formed from the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`. If the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.***
