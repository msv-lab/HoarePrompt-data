The variable `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and both `ans` and `tem` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values. However, we can state that `ans` is being updated based on the value of `tem`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is now at least equal to or less than `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l`, the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))` which is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is updated to be min(`ans`, `tem`).**
