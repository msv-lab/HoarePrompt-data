Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l`, `ans` contains the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i` where the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's and `ans` is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such `tem` exists, `ans` remains unchanged.**
