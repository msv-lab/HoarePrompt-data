The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is expected to be a list of characters representing a number formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. Since the previous conditions state that `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, and the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's, `x` would likely consist of equal numbers of '7's and '4's. 

Thus, `tem` will be the integer representation of this combination. Assuming `x` is derived correctly, the output state will reflect the new value of `tem` being an integer formed from `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i` where the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's, `tem` is the integer formed by joining `x`.**
