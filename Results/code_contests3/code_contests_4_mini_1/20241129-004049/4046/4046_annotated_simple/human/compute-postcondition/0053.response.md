The code assigns the minimum value between `ans` and `tem` to `ans`. The value of `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, while `tem` is an integer formed from `x`. The variable `ans` is updated based on the values of `ans` and `tem`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, `tem` is the integer formed from `x`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.**
