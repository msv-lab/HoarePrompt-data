According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `i`, starting from `l`, which is an even integer less than 10, and increments `i` by 2 each time until it reaches 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l`, which is an even integer less than 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 2. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `l + 2`.

Since `l` is less than 10, `i` will remain less than 10 after the increment. Additionally, the loop will continue as long as `i` remains less than 10. 

Thus, the state to execute one more time should reflect the updated value of `i` and the condition that `i` needs to be less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 2`, `ans` contains the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i` where the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's and `ans` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
