According to the code, the loop will execute for every combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`. The variable `i` is `l + 4`, where `l` is an even integer less than 10. Thus, `i` can take values from 4 to 13 (since `l` can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). 

At the end of the last iteration, we have a combination `x` formed from '7's and '4's. The loop will execute again as long as there are more combinations to generate.

The next combination will be the next in the lexicographical order of combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. The loop will continue until all combinations have been exhausted.

Since `x` is the current combination, the next combination will still be of length `i`, and since we are generating combinations from '74', we can assume that the next `x` will be different but still consists of '7's and '4's.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `x` will be updated to the next combination of '7's and '4's of the same length `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, `tem` is the integer formed from the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`**
