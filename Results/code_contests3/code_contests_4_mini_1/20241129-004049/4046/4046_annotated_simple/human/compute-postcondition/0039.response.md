The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and the integer representation of `x`, which is `tem`. The values of `n`, `l`, `i`, and `x` are not directly affected by this operation, but `ans` will be updated depending on the comparison between its current value and `tem`. 

Since `ans` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is an integer representation of `x`, the new value of `ans` will either remain the same or be updated to `tem`, depending on whether `tem` is smaller than the current value of `ans`.

Assuming the values of `ans` and `tem` are known, the output state will reflect the possible values of `ans` after this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer less than 10; `i` is `l + 2`; `ans` is min(`ans`, `tem`); `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`; `tem` is an integer representation of `x`.**
