The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The current value of `tem` is derived from the combination of '7' and '4' of length `i`, and since `tem` is now equal to `int(''.join(x))`, it holds a specific integer value. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, but it will be compared to `tem`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the minimum value calculation, resulting in an updated state of `ans`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, `tem` is the integer derived from the combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`, `x` is the next combination of '7' and '4' of length `i`, `tem` is now equal to `int(''.join(x))`, `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, `tem`)**
