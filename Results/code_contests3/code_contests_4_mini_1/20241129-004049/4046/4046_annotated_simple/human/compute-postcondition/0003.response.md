The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is an odd integer (as specified in the initial state), adding 1 to it will result in an even integer. The other variables `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer; `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer; `ans` is 4444477777**.
