According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. The loop is structured to iterate from `l` up to (but not including) 10, incrementing by 2 on each iteration. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value `l` must be less than 10 and should be an even integer (since the loop increments by 2). 

Given that `l` is stated to be an even integer, we can conclude that `l` must satisfy the condition `l < 10` for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to specify a valid value for `l` as an even integer less than 10. 

Since `n` being a positive integer does not directly affect the loop execution, we can focus on `l` and `i`, which initializes to `l`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l`**
