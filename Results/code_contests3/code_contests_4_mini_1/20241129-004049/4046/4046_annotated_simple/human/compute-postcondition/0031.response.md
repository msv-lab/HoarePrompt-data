Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 2`, and `ans` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` where the count of '7's equals the count of '4's. If `ans` has an equal count of '7's and '4's, and if the integer value of `ans` (denoted as `tem`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`.***
