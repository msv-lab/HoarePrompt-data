The variable `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`, where `i` is `l + 2`. The code converts the string representation of `x` to an integer by first joining the characters of `x` into a single string and then converting that string to an integer using `int()`. 

The previous value of `x` has not been explicitly provided, but since it represents a valid combination of '7's and '4's, `tem` will be assigned a positive integer value based on that combination. 

As no specific values or combinations are given for `x`, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem` but we can conclude that `tem` will be a positive integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer less than 10; `i` is `l + 2`; `ans` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of '7's and '4's; `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`; `tem` is an integer representation of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer less than 10; `i` is `l + 2`; `ans` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of '7's and '4's; `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`; `tem` is an integer representation of `x`.**
