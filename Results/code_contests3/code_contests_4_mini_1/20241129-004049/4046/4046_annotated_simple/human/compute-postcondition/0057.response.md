The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The initial state indicates that `x` is expected to be a collection of characters (likely a list or a tuple) that are either '7's or '4's, as it is forming the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`. The specific contents of `x` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. However, we know that `tem` will be an integer formed by joining the characters in `x` and converting them to an integer.

Given that other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`, `ans`) are not impacted by this line of code, the output state will focus on the assignment of `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, `tem` is the integer formed from the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`**.
