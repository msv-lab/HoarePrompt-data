In the given code snippet, `tem` is being assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. Here, `x` represents the next combination of '7' and '4' of length `i`. Since `i` is equal to `l + 1`, and `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is guaranteed to be a positive integer. The value of `x` is derived from the combinations of '7' and '4', thus `x` will be a string made up of these characters.

After executing the code, `tem` will hold the integer value of the string created by joining the characters in `x`.

The output state will reflect the new value of `tem` based on the integer representation of the string formed by `x`. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged, so we keep them in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 1`, `tem` is the integer derived from the combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i`, `x` is the next combination of '7' and '4' of length `i`, and `tem` is now equal to `int(''.join(x))`.**
