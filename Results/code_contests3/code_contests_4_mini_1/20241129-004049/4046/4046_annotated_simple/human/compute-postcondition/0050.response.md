Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, and `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i` where the count of '7's is equal to the count of '4's. If `x` contains an equal number of '7's and '4's, and if `tem` (formed by joining `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
