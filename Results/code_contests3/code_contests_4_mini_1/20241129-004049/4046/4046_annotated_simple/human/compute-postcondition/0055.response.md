Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`, and `tem` is the integer formed from `x`. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
