The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and since `ans` is the minimum integer formed by combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of each, the value of `ans` could either remain the same or change to `tem` if `tem` is smaller.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` is updated based on the comparison with `tem`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `l` is an even integer less than 10, `i` is `l + 4`, `ans` is updated to min(`ans`, `tem`), `tem` is an integer formed by joining `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
