Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` from user input, and calculates the smallest integer composed of equal numbers of the digits '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`, with the total number of digits being even. If no such number can be formed with lengths up to 8, it will return the default value of 4444477777. The function prints this resulting integer. **
