Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9; `l` is an even integer less than 10; `i` is `l + 2`; `ans` is a valid combination of '7's and '4's of length `i` with equal counts of '7's and '4's. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, then `tem`, formed by joining the characters in `x`, is compared to `n`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`; if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are not equal, no changes occur to `ans`.***
