Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, which is at least 3, and `x` represents all combinations generated by product('74', repeat=i). If the counts of '7's and '4's in the combinations generated by `x` are equal, then `tem` is the integer formed by joining these combinations, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
