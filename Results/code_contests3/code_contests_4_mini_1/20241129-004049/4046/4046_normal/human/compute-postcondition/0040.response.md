Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The variable `i` is set to `l + 2`, and `tem` is the integer formed by the next combination of '7's and '4's.***
