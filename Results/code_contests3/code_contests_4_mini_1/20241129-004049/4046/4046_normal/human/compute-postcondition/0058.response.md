The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Since `tem` is 44447, the new value of `ans` will be the minimum of its previous value and 44447. However, the previous value of `ans` is not provided, so we cannot determine its specific new value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than or equal to 5, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `x` is '44447', `i` is 5, `tem` is 44447.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than or equal to 5, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `x` is '44447', `i` is 5, `tem` is 44447.**
