Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, and `tem` is the integer value derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, while `i` is set to `l`. There is no else part.***
