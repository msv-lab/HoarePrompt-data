Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` in the range of 1 to 10^9 and finds the smallest integer made up of the digits '4' and '7' that has an equal number of '4's and '7's, which is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such integer can be formed, it defaults to returning the value 4444477777. If `n` has an odd number of digits, it adjusts the length to the next even number before performing its calculations. **
