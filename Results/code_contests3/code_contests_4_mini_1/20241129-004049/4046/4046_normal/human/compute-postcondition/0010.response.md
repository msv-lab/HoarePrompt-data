The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The current value of `ans` is 4444477777, and since `tem` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9), the value of `tem` could be larger than or equal to 4444477777 but not less. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to either retain its current value or be set to `tem`. The exact new value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `tem`. Thus, the output state reflects the relationship between `ans` and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`; `i` is `l`, `x` is the first combination generated by product('74', repeat=i), `tem` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `n`.**
