`l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is an odd number, incrementing it will result in an even number. The values of `n` and `ans` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number; `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number; `ans` is 4444477777**.
