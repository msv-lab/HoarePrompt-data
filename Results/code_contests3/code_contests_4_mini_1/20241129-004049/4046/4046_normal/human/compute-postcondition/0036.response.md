Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an odd number less than 10; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`; `i` is `l + 2`, which is at least 3; `x` represents the next combination generated by product('74', repeat=i); if `x` has an equal count of '7's and '4's, and the integer `tem` formed by joining the characters of `x` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
