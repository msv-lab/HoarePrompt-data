Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`, `i` is `l`. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.***
