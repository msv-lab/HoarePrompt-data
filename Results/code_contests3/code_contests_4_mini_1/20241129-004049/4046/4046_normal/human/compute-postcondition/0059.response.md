Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than or equal to 5, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `x` is '44447', `i` is 5, and `tem` is 44447. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` retains the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, while the values of `l`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
