The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The previous value of `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and `tem`. The other variables `n`, `l`, `i`, and `tem` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `i` is `l`, `tem` is the integer value derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `i` is `l`, `tem` is the integer value derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`**.
