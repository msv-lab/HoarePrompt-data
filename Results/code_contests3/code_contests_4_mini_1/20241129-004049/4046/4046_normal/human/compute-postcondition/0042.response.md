Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, which is at least 3. If no valid combination of '7's and '4's was found, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
