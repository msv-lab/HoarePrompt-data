The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and the value of `tem`. Since `ans` is defined as the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`, the impact of the code will be to potentially update `ans` to the value of `tem` if `tem` is smaller than the current value of `ans`. The values of `l`, `i`, and `tem` are not directly changed by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the new value of `ans`, depending on the comparison between `ans` and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an odd number less than 10; `ans` is updated to min(ans, tem); `i` is `l + 2`; `tem` is the integer formed by the next combination of '7' and '4'.**
