`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` represents the next combination generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`. The output of `''.join(x)` will create a string of digits formed by the combination of the characters '7' and '4', repeated `i` times, which is `l + 2`. The exact value of `tem` will depend on the specific combination generated, which is not provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an odd number less than 10; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`; `i` is `l + 2`; `tem` is the integer formed by the next combination of '7' and '4'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an odd number less than 10; `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`; `i` is `l + 2`; `tem` is the integer formed by the next combination of '7' and '4'.**
