`tem` is assigned the value formed by joining the elements of the list `x`, which is the string '44447'. When converted to an integer, `tem` becomes 44447. The values of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than or equal to 5, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `x` is '44447', `i` is 5, `tem` is 44447.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than or equal to 5, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `x` is '44447', `i` is 5, `tem` is 44447.**
