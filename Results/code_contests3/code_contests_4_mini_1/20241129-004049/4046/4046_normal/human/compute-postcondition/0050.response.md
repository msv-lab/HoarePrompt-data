Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than or equal to 5, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and the least integer formed by equal counts of '7's and '4's that is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts of '7's and '4's in `x` are equal, `tem` is assigned the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of the previous `ans` and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
