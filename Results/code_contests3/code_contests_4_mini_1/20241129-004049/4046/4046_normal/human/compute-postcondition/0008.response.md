The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The variable `x` is generated by the product of '74' repeated `i` times, where `i` is equal to `l`. Since `l` is an odd number less than 10, the possible values for `l` are 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The variable `x` will be a string consisting of '7's and '4's, and it has an equal count of '7's and '4's. 

For an odd `l`, the combinations generated by `product('74', repeat=i)` will always have an unequal number of '7's and '4's unless `i` is 0, which is not possible here since `l` is at least 1. Thus, the structure of `x` leads to `tem` being the integer formed by concatenating the characters in `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` cannot be determined without specific values for `l`, we can note that `tem` will hold a valid integer formed from the combinations of '7' and '4'. Therefore, we can conclude that `tem` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, `i` is `l`, `x` is the first combination generated by product('74', repeat=i), and `tem` is a positive integer.**
