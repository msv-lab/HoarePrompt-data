The variable `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The value of `tem` is derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`, and `ans` is compared to this value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `l`, and `i`, while indicating the operation on `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`, `i` is `l`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and `tem`.**
