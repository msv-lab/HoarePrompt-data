`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the concatenation of the elements in `x` into an integer. The previous values of `x` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`, `i` is `l`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an odd number less than 10, `tem` is an integer derived from the combinations of '74' generated by `x`, `i` is `l`**.
