To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and check for potential edge cases.

The problem requires us to represent an integer \( n_i \) as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. A composite number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that is not prime, meaning it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Given Program:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

### Analysis:
1. The program processes multiple queries using a loop, which is correct as per the problem description.
2. It checks whether the number \( a \) is odd. If it is, it subtracts 9 and sets a counter \( c \) to 1.
3. It then checks if the modified \( a \) is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there are no valid splittings into composite summands.
4. If \( a \) is not in that set, it calculates \( a / 4 + c \) and prints that value.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling of Small Values**: The numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 are directly checked, which is correct since they cannot be represented as sums of composite numbers. However, the numbers 4 and 6 are not included in this check.
  - For example:
    - For \( n = 4 \): The expected output should be 1 since 4 itself is composite.
    - For \( n = 6 \): The expected output should also be 1 since it can be expressed as \( 4 + 2 \) or \( 6 \) itself.
- **Handling of Even Values**: The program does not correctly handle all even values. For example:
  - For \( n = 8 \): The expected output should be 2 (as \( 4 + 4 \)).
  - For \( n = 10 \): The expected output should be 2 (as \( 4 + 6 \)).
  
Thus, there are several even numbers that can be split into composite numbers (like 4, 6, 8, 10, etc.) which the program fails to account for accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all the cases as stipulated in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to provide the correct outputs for several even integers.

Correctness: **False**.
