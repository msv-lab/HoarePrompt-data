To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to represent a positive integer `n_i` as the sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands. If no such representation exists, the output should be -1.

### Program Analysis:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. The program first checks if the input number `a` is odd. If it is, it subtracts 9 from `a` and sets a counter `c` to 1. This implies that the program is trying to account for the fact that odd numbers cannot be represented directly as sums of even composite numbers.
  
2. The program then checks if the modified (or unmodified, if even) `a` is in the set `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}`. If it is, it outputs -1, indicating that no valid composite summands can be formed.

3. If `a` is even and greater than 2, it calculates the output using `a / 4 + c`. This is intended to count the number of composite summands possible.

### Edge Cases:
- The case where `a` is equal to 1, 2, or 3 should correctly return -1 as there are no composite numbers less than 4.
- For odd numbers less than 9 (such as 1, 3, 5, 7), after subtracting 9, they will become negative or zero, which is not valid. The output should be -1.
- For even numbers, the program will output `a / 4 + c`. However, itâ€™s essential to ensure that the calculation remains valid and that the logic matches the requirements for composing with composite numbers.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints clarify that the program reads integers from input and processes them according to the rules outlined. It correctly considers odd and even cases but seems to imply that it may not handle certain conditions correctly, particularly those involving the subtraction of 9.

### Discrepancy Identification:
- The program does not handle cases where `a` becomes negative after subtracting 9, leading to incorrect behavior because it still operates on `a` without any additional checks.
- For example, if `a` starts as 1, the program will subtract 9, resulting in -8, which is then not checked against the set and will yield a potentially incorrect calculation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case due to the lack of handling for negative values and the specific cases where `a` can lead to invalid outputs.

Correctness: **False**.
