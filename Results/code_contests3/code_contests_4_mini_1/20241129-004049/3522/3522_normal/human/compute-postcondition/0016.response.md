`a` is assigned the value of `input()`, but since `input()` accepts a user input, the value of `a` is now an input string. The variable `c` remains undefined, and there are no changes to any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input string; `c` is undefined.

Output State: **`a` is an input string; `c` is undefined**
