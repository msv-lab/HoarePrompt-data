The code checks if `a` is in the set of prime numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and prints `-1` if it is. Since `a` is a positive integer that has been converted to an even integer, it cannot be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 11, but it could be 2. If `a` is 2, the output will be `-1`. If `a` is any other even positive integer greater than 2, then `c` will be 0 (because `a` was originally even), and the output will be `a / 4`. 

Thus, the output state can be described as follows:

- If `a` is 2, the output will be `-1`.
- If `a` is an even integer greater than 2, then the output will be `a / 4`.

Therefore, since `a` can have multiple possible values but is confirmed to be even, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a positive even integer; if `a` is 2, output is -1; if `a` is greater than 2, output is `a / 4`**.
