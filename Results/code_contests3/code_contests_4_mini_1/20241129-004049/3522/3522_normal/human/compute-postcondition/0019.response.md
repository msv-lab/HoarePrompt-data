The value of `c` is assigned 1, but since an error occurs due to an invalid operation, the assignment does not take effect. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input string; `c` is 0 and an error occurs due to an invalid operation.

Output State: **`a` is an input string; `c` is 0 and an error occurs due to an invalid operation.**
