The code attempts to perform a subtraction operation on the variable `a`, which is an input string. Since strings cannot be directly subtracted from an integer (in this case, 9), the operation will result in an error. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input string; `c` is 0 and an error occurs due to an invalid operation.**
