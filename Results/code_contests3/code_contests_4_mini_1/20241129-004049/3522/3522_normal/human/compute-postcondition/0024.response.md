Functionality: ** The function processes a sequence of positive integers `a` (where `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`), reading `q` integers from input, where `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). For each integer `a`, if `a` is odd, it is reduced by 9 and a flag `c` is set to 1, otherwise `c` remains 0. The output is -1 if `a` is one of the numbers in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If `a` is even and greater than 2, the output is calculated as `a / 4 + c`. The function does not handle errors for invalid operations that may occur if an odd integer is processed, which could lead to erroneous behavior.**
