The `print` statement evaluates the condition `a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. Since `a` is a positive even integer, it cannot be in that set. Thus, the `else` part is executed, which calculates `a / 4 + c`. The value of `c` is not defined in the initial state, but since the condition regarding `a` being odd does not apply, we cannot conclude a specific value for `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `a` and the undefined nature of `c`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive even integer; `c` is undefined; print outputs a / 4 + c**
