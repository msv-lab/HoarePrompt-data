The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as its signature shows no input parameters. Instead, it operates based on the constraints provided for `q` and `ni`. 

The parameter `q` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5. Additionally, each `ni` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9. The function will likely process these integers in some manner, but since the specific operations are not described, we can only infer the nature of the parameters and their constraints.

Based on the output description, the function will likely return a result based on the processing of `q` and the list of integers defined by `ni`. However, without specific details about the output, we can only state the constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but processes a positive integer `q` (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) and a list of positive integers `ni` (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9). The specific return value is not defined in the provided information.**
