`c` is assigned the value 0, which initializes it but does not affect the values of `q` or `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer; `a` is an input string that represents a positive integer; `c` is 0.
Output State: **`q` is a positive integer; `a` is an input string that represents a positive integer; `c` is 0**
