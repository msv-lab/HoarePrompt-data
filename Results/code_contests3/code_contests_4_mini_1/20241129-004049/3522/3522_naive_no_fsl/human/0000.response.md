To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

1. **Understanding the Problem:** 
   - We need to split a positive integer `ni` into a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands.
   - Composite numbers start from 4 (the smallest composite number).
   - We should return -1 if `ni` cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   The program logic checks for the following:
   - If `ni` is odd, it subtracts 9 and increments the count of summands `c` by 1.
   - Then it checks if the modified `ni` is in the set of numbers {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If it is, it returns -1, meaning it cannot be expressed as a sum of composites.
   - If it is not in that set, it calculates the number of composite summands as `ni / 4 + c`.

3. **Identifying Potential Cases:**
   Let's consider some edge cases:
   - For `ni = 5`, the program first checks if 5 is odd, which it is, so it subtracts 9, resulting in -4 and `c` becomes 1. Since -4 is not in the set, it would incorrectly calculate `-4 / 4 + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0`, but it should return -1 for 5 as it cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers.
   - For `ni = 6`, it checks if 6 is odd (it is not), then it checks if 6 is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, which it isnâ€™t. It calculates `6 / 4 + 0 = 1.5`, which is incorrect because it should return 1 (6 can be represented as 4 + 2, but 2 is not composite, so it should return -1).
   - For `ni = 9`, it subtracts 9 (as it is odd), resulting in 0 and `c` becomes 1. This again leads to an incorrect output because 0 isn't valid.

4. **Conclusion:**
Given the above analysis, the program does not handle several cases correctly, particularly odd numbers that are less than 10 and numbers that cannot be split into composite summands.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails for inputs like `5`, `6`, and `9`, returning incorrect outputs.
