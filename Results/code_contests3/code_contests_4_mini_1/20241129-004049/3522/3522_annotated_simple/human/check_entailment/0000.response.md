To determine the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we will analyze how the program behaves based on the requirements specified.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. **Input:**
   - A number of queries `q`.
   - Each query consists of a positive integer `n_i`.

2. **Output:**
   - For each integer `n_i`, output the maximum number of composite summands that can sum to `n_i`.
   - If no such summands exist, output `-1`.

3. **Composite Numbers:**
   - Composite numbers are integers greater than 1 that are not prime.

### Observations from the Code:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code reads `q` using `input()`, which is correct.

2. **Looping through Queries:**
   - The for loop iterates over the number of queries, which is correct.

3. **Even and Odd Handling:**
   - If `a` (the current query number) is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments a counter `c`. 
   - This is an attempt to convert the odd number into an even one, as an even number can be split into composites more easily.

4. **Composite Check:**
   - After adjusting `a`, the program checks if `a` is in the set `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. If it is, it outputs `-1`, as these numbers cannot be represented as sums of composite numbers.

5. **Calculating the Result:**
   - If `a` is not in the set of small numbers, the program outputs `a / 4 + c`. This means it is calculating how many times 4 (the smallest composite number) can fit into `a`, plus `c` which accounts for the odd adjustment.

### Errors and Issues:
- **Incorrect Output:**
  - The program uses integer division (`a / 4`), which in Python 2 would yield a float. The expected output should be an integer. It should use `a // 4` instead to ensure integer division.
  
- **Handling of Specific Values:**
  - The check for `-1` only accounts for certain small numbers but does not consider all possible cases for odd numbers greater than 9 or even numbers like 6, which can only be split into one composite (6 = 4 + 2). The handling for these cases is not adequately addressed.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not cover all cases accurately as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to handle the representation of even numbers like 6 correctly and improperly handles the output type for integer division.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it may produce incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
