The code attempts to perform an arithmetic operation involving `a`, which is a string. Since an error occurs when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a string and it is not specified that `a` has been assigned a valid integer value, the program cannot execute the division or the addition operation. The value of `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on the previous state of `a`, but since the code cannot proceed with the arithmetic calculation due to the type error, we cannot determine a numerical output. 

Therefore, the Output State is: an error occurs due to the attempt to perform arithmetic operations on a string; `c` remains either 1 or 0 based on the previous state of `a`.

Output State: **an error occurs due to the attempt to perform arithmetic operations on a string; `c` remains either 1 or 0 based on the previous state of `a`.**
