The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters since it has no parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that the function processes a number of queries, `q`, which is a positive integer, and for each query, there is a positive integer `ni` that satisfies the condition 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9. The function processes these queries and returns results based on the input values.

Functionality: **The function processes a number of queries, where the number of queries `q` is a positive integer, and for each query, it handles a positive integer `ni` such that 1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9. The function returns results based on these queries.**
