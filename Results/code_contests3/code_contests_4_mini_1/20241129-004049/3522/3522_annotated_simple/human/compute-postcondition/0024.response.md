Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input representing the number of queries and processes each query with a positive integer `ni` (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9). For each input value `a`, if `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and sets a flag `c` to 1; otherwise, `c` remains 0. The function then checks if the modified or original value of `a` is one of the small primes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) and returns -1 if so. If not, it returns the result of `a / 4 + c`. This means the function can return -1 for certain small prime values and calculates a value based on division and conditionally set flags for odd inputs. The function does not return any values explicitly but prints the results directly to the output for each query.**
