The code attempts to print the result of a conditional expression. However, there is an error because it tries to evaluate `a` in a way that is not valid since `a` is a string. The value of `c` is 1, and since `a` is a string, the expression `a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)` results in a comparison between a string and integers, which will always return `False`. 

Thus, the code will attempt to execute the `else` part of the conditional expression. The expression `a / 4` tries to divide a string by an integer, which will also raise an error. Therefore, the output state reflects that an error occurs due to incorrect data type operations.

Output State: **An error occurs due to attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a string `a`.**
