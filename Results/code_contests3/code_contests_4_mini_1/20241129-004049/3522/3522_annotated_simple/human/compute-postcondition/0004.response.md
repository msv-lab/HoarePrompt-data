The variable `a` is assigned a new value which is `a - 9`. Since `a` is an odd number, subtracting 9 from it will result in another odd number. The value of `c` remains unchanged at 0, and `q` is also unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an odd number minus 9, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an odd number minus 9, `c` is 0**
