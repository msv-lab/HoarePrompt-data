To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the provided code.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `a` can either be odd or even.
   - If `a` is odd, then `a` is reduced by 9 and `c` is set to 1.
   - If `a` is not odd (even), `c` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Logic**: 
   - The code evaluates whether `a` is in the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`.
   - If `a` is in that set, it prints `-1`.
   - If not, it calculates `a / 4 + c`.

3. **Variable Effects**:
   - If `a` is odd, it will change to `a - 9` and `c` will become `1`.
   - If `a` is even, there are no changes to `c`.

4. **Calculating the Output**:
   - If `a` is in `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`, the output will be `-1`.
   - If `a` is not in that set, we need to compute `a / 4 + c`, where `c` will either be `0` (if `a` was even) or `1` (if `a` was odd).

Since we do not have specific values for `a` or `c`, we cannot compute a numeric output. The output will depend on whether `a` is odd/even and whether it is in the specified set.

Thus, we can summarize the output state based on the conditions:

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is either odd or even, which affects `c`; the output is either -1 or the result of `a / 4 + c`.**
