The value of `c` is assigned 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, but since the error occurred due to attempting to subtract 9 from a string, we can infer that the execution of the program has not been able to proceed normally. However, the assignment of `c` to 1 is valid and will take place. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input string; `c` is 1; an error occurs due to attempting to subtract 9 from a string.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `a` is an input string; `c` is 1; an error occurs due to attempting to subtract 9 from a string.**
