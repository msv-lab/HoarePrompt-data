Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Odd Numbers:** The program reduces odd numbers by 9 and increments the counter `c` by 1. However, this does not ensure that the resulting number can be expressed as a sum of composite summands. For instance, if `n = 15`, after subtracting 9, we get `6`, which can be expressed as `4 + 2`, but it does not fulfill the requirement since `2` is not composite.

2. **Invalid Splittings:** The program checks if the adjusted number `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) to return -1. While this is partially correct, it fails to account for other cases where valid composite summands cannot be formed. For example, if `n = 13`, after reducing by 9, we would get `4`, which is valid, but if `n = 5`, after reducing by 9, we would get a negative number, which is not handled correctly.

3. **Output Calculation:** The output `a / 4 + c` for even numbers assumes that every multiple of 4 can be expressed as a sum of 4's, but this is not a comprehensive check for all composite summands. The program does not consider the fact that some numbers may not be representable as sums of composites even if they are greater than or equal to 4.

4. **Integer Division Issue:** The program uses `a / 4`, which performs floating-point division in Python 2. This could lead to incorrect results since the number of summands must be an integer.

Overall, the logic for determining the maximum number of composite summands and the handling of different cases (especially for odd numbers and specific conditions) is flawed. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
