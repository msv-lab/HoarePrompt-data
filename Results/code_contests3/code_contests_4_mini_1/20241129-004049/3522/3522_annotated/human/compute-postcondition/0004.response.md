The value of `a` is decremented by 9. Since `a` is an odd integer, subtracting 9 from it will result in another odd integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an odd integer minus 9; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an odd integer minus 9; `c` is 0**
