To determine the output state, we must analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `a` is checked to see if it is odd or even.
   - If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9, and `c` is set to 1.
   - If `a` is even, `c` remains unchanged.

2. The expression `print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c` will be evaluated.
   - If the modified or original value of `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), it will print `-1`.
   - If not, it will print the result of `a / 4 + c`.

Given that `q` is a positive integer within the specified range, we consider that `a` can take any integer value corresponding to that range. The output state will depend on the specific value of `a` and how it interacts with the conditions laid out in the code.

Since no specific values for `a` or `c` are provided, the output state is generalized based on the conditions:

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; if `a` is an odd integer, then `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, there is no change to `c; print -1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c**
