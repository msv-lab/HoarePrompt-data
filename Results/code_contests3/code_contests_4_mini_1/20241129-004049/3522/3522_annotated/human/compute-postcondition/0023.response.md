The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it works with a defined set of constraints. The constraints specify that `q` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, and for each query `ni`, it is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1,000,000,000. The function processes these queries and returns results based on the stipulations of the queries. 

Since the exact output of the function is not provided, we can infer that it likely returns some results based on the queries provided, adhering to the constraints mentioned.

Functionality: **The function processes a set of queries defined by a positive integer q and positive integers ni, returning results based on these queries while adhering to the specified constraints.**
