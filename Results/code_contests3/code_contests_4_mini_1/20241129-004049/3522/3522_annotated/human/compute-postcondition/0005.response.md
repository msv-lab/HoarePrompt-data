`c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, but now it has changed to 1. The values of `q` and `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an odd integer minus 9; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an odd integer minus 9; `c` is 1**
