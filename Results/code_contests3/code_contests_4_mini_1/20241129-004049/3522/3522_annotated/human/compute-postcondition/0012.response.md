`c` is assigned the value 1. The variable `c` previously held the value 0, so after execution, `c` is now 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 1**
