`c` is assigned the value `0`. Since no previous values of `c` exist before this assignment, and no other variables are affected by this code, the output state reflects the current values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input string; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is an input string; `c` is 0**
