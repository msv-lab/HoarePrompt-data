Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple queries defined by a positive integer `q` and processes each query with a positive integer `a`. If `a` is odd, it is reduced by 9 and a counter `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, `c` remains 0. The function then prints -1 if the adjusted `a` is one of the values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), or prints the result of `a / 4 + c` otherwise. It handles multiple queries, printing a result for each. **
