To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the provided code given the initial state.

Initial State: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an input string, and if `a` is an odd number, then `c` is set to 1.

The code provided is:
```
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. The code checks if `a` is in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). Here, `a` is expected to be an input string, but it is being compared with integers in the tuple. Therefore, this condition will evaluate to `False` if `a` is indeed a string representation of a number.
2. If `a` is not in the tuple, the expression `a / 4 + c` will be evaluated. Since `a` is a string, it cannot be directly divided by 4. This will lead to an error if `a` is not converted to a number first.
3. The variable `c` is dependent on whether `a` is an odd number. If `a` is an odd number, then `c` is set to 1; otherwise, `c` would not be defined in the provided information.

Given these observations, if `a` is a valid odd number string, `c` would be 1, and the output would result in an error due to the invalid operation. If `a` is a string that represents an integer not in the specified set, the output would also yield an error due to the division by 4.

Since the specific input for `a` is not provided, we cannot determine a definitive output value, but we can conclude the behavior given the conditions stated.

Output State: **`a` is an input string; an error occurs due to invalid operations (string comparison and division by an integer).**
