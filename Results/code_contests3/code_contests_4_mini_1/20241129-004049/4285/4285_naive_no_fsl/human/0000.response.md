Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The task is to find the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, but the given code attempts to check if a string is a palindrome by filtering alphabetic characters and comparing the result to its reverse. 

This logic does not address the problem at all, as it does not generate even-length palindromes based on the input integer `n`. 

For example:
- If the input is `1`, the expected output is `11`. However, the program does not produce any output related to even-length palindromes.
- If the input is `10`, the expected output is `1001`, which the program also does not provide.

Thus, the program is incorrect for any input in the context of the problem description.
