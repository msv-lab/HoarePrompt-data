The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a string containing alphanumeric characters. The function processes this string by filtering out non-alphabetic characters, converting the remaining characters to lowercase, and then checking if the result is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). 

The annotations imply that the function would return `True` for an empty string, but the actual code will only return `True` if the processed string (after filtering and lowercasing) is a palindrome. If `n` consists solely of non-alphabetic characters, the function will also return `True` since it will produce an empty string, which is trivially a palindrome.

However, if `n` contains alphabetic characters, the output will depend on whether the resultant string is a palindrome. Thus, the function's behavior includes the following key points:
- It returns `True` if the input string yields an empty string after filtering (all non-alphabetic characters).
- It returns `False` if the resultant string is not a palindrome.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and returns `True` if the resulting string is a palindrome or if itâ€™s empty. It returns `False` if the resulting string is not a palindrome. **
