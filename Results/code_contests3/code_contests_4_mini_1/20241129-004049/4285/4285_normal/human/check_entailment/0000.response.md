The provided problem description requires a program that returns the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. Even-length palindromes are numbers that have an even number of digits and read the same forwards and backwards, starting from 11, 22, 33, ..., up to larger numbers like 1001, etc.

The provided code is:

```python
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if the input string `n` is a palindrome after filtering out non-alphabetic characters and converting it to lowercase. This does not match the problem description, which requires generating the n-th even-length palindrome number based on a given integer `n`.
2. **Mismatch with Problem Description**: The code is not even attempting to generate or return any palindrome numbers, nor does it handle integers as inputs. Thus, it completely misses the requirements of the problem statement.

### Edge Cases:
Since the code doesn't operate on numeric inputs or generate palindromes, it can't appropriately handle any edge cases related to determining the n-th even-length palindrome.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe a function that checks for palindromes in a string context, which is unrelated to finding the n-th even-length palindrome number. Therefore, the hints also do not align with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for any potential case, as it does not generate or return the n-th even-length positive palindrome number as required. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The provided function does not solve the problem as specified, as it checks for palindrome properties in strings rather than computing the requested palindromic numbers.
