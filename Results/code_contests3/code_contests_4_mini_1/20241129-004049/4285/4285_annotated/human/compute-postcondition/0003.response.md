The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer represented as a string. The function processes the string `n` by filtering out any non-alphabetic characters and converting the remaining characters to lowercase. It then checks if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards. 

However, the annotations inaccurately suggest that `n` is strictly a positive integer and that `x` is guaranteed to be an empty string. In reality, if `n` contains alphabetic characters, `x` will not be empty, and the function will correctly evaluate whether `x` is a palindrome based on its contents. 

The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` may not contain any alphabetic characters at all, resulting in `x` being an empty string. In such a case, the function will return `True`, which is correctly stated in the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise. **
