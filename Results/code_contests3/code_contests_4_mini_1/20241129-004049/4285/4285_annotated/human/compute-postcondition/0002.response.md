The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{1000000}\). After executing the function body, it returns `True` since 'x' is an empty string and it is equal to its reverse. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` based on the condition that an empty string is equal to its reverse. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns True based on the condition that an empty string is equal to its reverse.**
