In the provided code snippet, `x` is assigned the value of a string that is constructed by joining together the lowercase versions of all alphabetic characters found in `n`. The initial state of `n` being a positive integer implies that it contains no alphabetic characters. Therefore, the list comprehension `[x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()]` will result in an empty list since `n` consists solely of digits.

As a result, `x` will be assigned an empty string. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000; `x` is an empty string**
