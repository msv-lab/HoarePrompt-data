Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to find the n-th even-length positive palindrome number. However, the current implementation does not calculate or return any palindrome number. Instead, it processes the input `n` as a string and checks whether it is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters. This is not relevant to finding even-length palindrome numbers.

2. **Input Handling**: The input should be a positive integer `n`, but the function is treating `n` as a string and applying string operations that are irrelevant to the problem. The function checks for palindrome properties in `n` rather than generating the n-th even-length palindrome.

3. **Output**: The expected output is the n-th even-length palindrome number, but the function does not produce this output. Instead, it returns a boolean value indicating if a string is a palindrome, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

4. **Missing Logic**: There is no logic in the function that generates even-length palindromes or counts up to the n-th one, which is the core requirement of the problem.

In summary, the function does not implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described, thus making it incorrect.
