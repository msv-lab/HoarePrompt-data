#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True since 'x' is an empty string and it is equal to its reverse
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, converts the remaining characters to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome, returning `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.
