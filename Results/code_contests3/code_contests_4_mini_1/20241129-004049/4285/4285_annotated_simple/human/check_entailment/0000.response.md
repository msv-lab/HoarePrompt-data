Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description at all. The problem asks for a program that outputs the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, while the annotated program instead attempts to check if a string is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and comparing it to its reverse. 

Key issues with the program:
1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to determine if a given input is a palindrome, rather than generating or returning the n-th even-length palindrome number as specified in the problem description.
2. **Input Handling**: The function is trying to process `n` as a string and is checking for alphabetic characters, which is irrelevant to the task of finding even-length palindromes.
3. **Output**: The function returns a boolean indicating if a string is a palindrome, which does not align with the requirement to output the n-th even-length positive palindrome number.

Since the program does not address the problem as defined, it is correct to conclude that the program is incorrect.
