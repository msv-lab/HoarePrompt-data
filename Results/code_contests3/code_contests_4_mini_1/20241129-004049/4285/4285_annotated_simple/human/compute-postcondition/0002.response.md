The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{100000} \). After executing the function body, the program checks if an empty string is equal to its reverse and returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` based on a specific comparison involving an empty string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer, and returns True based on the equality of an empty string and its reverse.**
