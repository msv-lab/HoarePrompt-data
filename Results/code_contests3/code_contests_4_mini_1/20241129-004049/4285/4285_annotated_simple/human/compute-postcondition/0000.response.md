The code creates a new string `x` by joining together the lowercase versions of the alphabetical characters in `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it does not contain any alphabetical characters. Therefore, the resulting string `x` will be empty. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^100000; `x` is an empty string**
