The function `func_1` accepts a string `n` that is expected to contain alphabetic characters. It processes `n` by filtering out non-alphabetic characters and converting the remaining characters to lowercase. The function then checks if the resulting string is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards). 

The annotations incorrectly describe `n` as a positive integer and mention returning True based on the equality of an empty string and its reverse, which is misleading. The function will return True only if the filtered string of alphabetic characters is empty or a palindrome. 

It is important to note that if `n` contains no alphabetic characters, the function will return True because the resulting string will be empty, which does equal its reverse (also an empty string). 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `n`, filters it to retain only alphabetic characters converted to lowercase, and returns True if the resulting string is a palindrome or empty; otherwise, it returns False. **
