Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `s` is assigned the value of `p[i][0]`, which is part of a sorted list `p` in descending order by the first element of each tuple that includes (0, 0). If `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]`, then `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]` and `i` is set to 0.***
