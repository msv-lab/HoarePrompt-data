The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding the value of `s` and then subtracting `p[i][0]` from it. The value of `s` was previously assigned the value `p[i][0]`, so substituting `s` with `p[i][0]` in the expression results in `time_passed` being updated to the same value it had before, since the addition and subtraction cancel each other out. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n + 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n + 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[i][0]`, and `time_passed` remains unchanged.**
