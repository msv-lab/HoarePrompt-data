In this scenario, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The values of `fi` and `ti` depend on the user input, but the initial states of `n`, `s`, `i`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `fi` and `ti` after processing the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 0, `p` is an empty list, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from the input as integers.**
