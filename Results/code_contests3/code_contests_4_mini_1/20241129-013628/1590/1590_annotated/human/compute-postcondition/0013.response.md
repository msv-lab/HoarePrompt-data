The code `p.append((0, 0))` adds a tuple `(0, 0)` to the list `p`. The values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation. The state of `p` will change to include the new tuple while remaining sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition of the tuple to `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `p` is sorted in descending order by the first element of each tuple, and `p` now includes the tuple (0, 0).**
