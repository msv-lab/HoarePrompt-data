The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are taken from input, but since we do not have the specific input values, we cannot determine their exact values. The other variables `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the action of appending to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2; `p` now includes the tuple (fi, ti)**
