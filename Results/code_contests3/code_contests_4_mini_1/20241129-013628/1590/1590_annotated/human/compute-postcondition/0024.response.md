To analyze the code snippet provided, we need to examine the state of the variables before the execution of the code. 

We have the following initial conditions:
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100)
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `s` is assigned the value `p[i][0]`
- `time_passed` is updated by subtracting `p[i][0]` from it.

Now, we look at the code:
```
time_passed += p[i][1] - time_passed
```

1. The expression `p[i][1] - time_passed` is calculated first.
2. Then, `time_passed` is updated by adding the result of `p[i][1] - time_passed` to the current value of `time_passed`.

This means:
- The existing value of `time_passed` is being modified based on the value of `p[i][1]`.

Thus, the impact on the program is that `time_passed` is updated to a new value, but the exact value of `time_passed` after the operation depends on the specific values of `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`.

Since `n`, `i`, `s`, and `p` are not directly modified by the code snippet, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, we summarize the output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n + 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[i][0]`, `time_passed` is updated based on the expression `p[i][1] - time_passed`.**
