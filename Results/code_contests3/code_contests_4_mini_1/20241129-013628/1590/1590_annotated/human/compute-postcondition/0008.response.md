According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1, and since the for loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
