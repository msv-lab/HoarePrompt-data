The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by splitting the input string and converting the parts into integers. The input is taken through `raw_input()` and processed by `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignments for `fi` and `ti`, which are dependent on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 2; `fi` and `ti` are integers from input.**
