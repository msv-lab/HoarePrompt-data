The variable `p` is a tuple that contains the values `(fi, ti)` which are taken as user input. The code appends this tuple to the list `p`. Thus, after execution, `p` will now include the new tuple `(fi, ti)` alongside any previous values it contained if it was initialized as a list. The values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 1, and `p` now contains the previous tuples along with the new tuple (fi, ti).**
