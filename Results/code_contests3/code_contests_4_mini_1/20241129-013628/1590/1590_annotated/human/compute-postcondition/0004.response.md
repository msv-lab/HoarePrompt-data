The code `p.append((fi, ti))` appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are integers provided from the input. The previous values of `n`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged as this operation only affects the list `p`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `p` with the new tuple added. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 0, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti), `fi` and `ti` are integers from input.**
