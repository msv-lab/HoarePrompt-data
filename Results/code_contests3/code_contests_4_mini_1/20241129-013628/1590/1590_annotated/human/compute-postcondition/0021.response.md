According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has taken a value that is less than or equal to `n`, since the loop condition is `i in range(n + 1)`.

If `i` is currently equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`, which is the next value in the range. 

Additionally, since `p` is a sorted list (in descending order), we need to ensure that `p` has at least `n + 1` elements for the loop to execute successfully. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `p` must have at least `n + 1` elements**
