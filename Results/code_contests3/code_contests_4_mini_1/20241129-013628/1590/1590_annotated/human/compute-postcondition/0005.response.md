According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increase by 1 to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s` is an integer (1 ≤ s ≤ 1000), `i` is 1, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti), for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
