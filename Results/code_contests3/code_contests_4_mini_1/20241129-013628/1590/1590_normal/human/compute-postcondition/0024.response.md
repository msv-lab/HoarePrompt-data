The variable `time_passed` is updated by adding the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. The new value of `time_passed` is calculated as `time_passed + (p[i][1] - time_passed)`. The previous value of `time_passed` is updated to this new value, but the specific values of `p[i][1]` and `time_passed` are not provided.

Therefore, the Output State is: `time_passed` is updated based on the value of `p[i][1]` and the previous value of `time_passed`.
Output State: **`time_passed` is updated based on the value of `p[i][1]` and the previous value of `time_passed`.**
