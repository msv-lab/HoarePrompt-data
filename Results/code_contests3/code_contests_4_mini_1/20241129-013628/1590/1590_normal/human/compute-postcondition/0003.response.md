The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes user input to split it into two parts and convert them to integers. The variables `n`, `i`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer representing the top floor number based on user input, `p` is an empty list, `fi` is an integer from user input, and `ti` is another integer from user input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer representing the top floor number based on user input, `p` is an empty list, `fi` is an integer from user input, `ti` is another integer from user input.**
