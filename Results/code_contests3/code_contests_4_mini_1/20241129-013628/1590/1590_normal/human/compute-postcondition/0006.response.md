The code `fi, ti = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns those values to `fi` and `ti`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this input operation since `fi` and `ti` are new variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that `fi` and `ti` now hold the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values from input**
