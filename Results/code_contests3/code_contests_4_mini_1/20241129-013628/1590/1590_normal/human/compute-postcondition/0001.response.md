The code initializes an empty list `p`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, `s` is an integer representing the top floor number based on user input, and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, `s` is an integer representing the top floor number based on user input, `p` is an empty list**
