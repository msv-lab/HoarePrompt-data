The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned from input, but the exact values are not specified. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` now contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` now contains a tuple `(fi, ti)`**
