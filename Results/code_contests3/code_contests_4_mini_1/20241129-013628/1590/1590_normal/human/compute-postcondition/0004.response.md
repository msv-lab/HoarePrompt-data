The variable `p` is modified by appending a tuple `(fi, ti)` to it. The values of `fi` and `ti` are integers based on user input, and `p` was initially an empty list. Therefore, after execution, `p` will contain one element, which is the tuple consisting of the values of `fi` and `ti`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `s`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is an integer representing the top floor number based on user input, `p` is a list containing one tuple (fi, ti)**
