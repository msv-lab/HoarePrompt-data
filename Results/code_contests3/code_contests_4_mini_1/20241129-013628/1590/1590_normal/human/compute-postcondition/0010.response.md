`p` is a list that will have a new tuple `(fi, ti)` appended to it. The values of `fi` and `ti` are determined by input, and since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2, these conditions do not affect the operation of appending. The states of the variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, but `p` now includes the new tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` is based on input, `ti` is based on input, and `p` has a new tuple `(fi, ti)` appended.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` is based on input, `ti` is based on input, and `p` has a new tuple `(fi, ti)` appended.**
