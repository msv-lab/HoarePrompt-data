The code assigns values to `fi` and `ti` by reading a line of input, splitting it into two parts, and converting those parts to integers. The values of `fi` and `ti` are directly dependent on the input provided. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values based on input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values based on input.**
