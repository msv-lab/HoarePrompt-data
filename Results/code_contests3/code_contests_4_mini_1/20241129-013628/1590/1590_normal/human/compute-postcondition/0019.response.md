The code increments the value of `time_passed` by the difference between `p[i][1]` and the current value of `time_passed`. The previous value of `time_passed` is `s - p[i][0]`. Therefore, after execution, `time_passed` will be updated to `p[i][1]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of passengers (0 or greater), `s` is assigned the value of `p[0][0]`, `p` is sorted in descending order with (0, 0) appended, `time_passed` is updated to `p[i][1]`, `i` is 0, and `time_passed` is less than `p[i][1]**
