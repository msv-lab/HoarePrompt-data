According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
