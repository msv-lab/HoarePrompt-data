The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s`, and a collection of passenger data consisting of pairs of integers `fi` and `ti` for each passenger. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of passengers, constrained between 1 and 100. `s` is an integer representing the top floor number, constrained between 1 and 1000. Each passenger's data contains two integers: `fi`, which represents the floor number and is constrained between 1 and `s`, and `ti`, which represents the arrival time and is constrained between 1 and 1000.

The function processes this data and returns information based on the passengers' floors and arrival times. However, the specific output based on the provided input parameters is not detailed.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of passengers, an integer `s` representing the top floor number, and a list of passenger data consisting of pairs of integers `fi` (floor number) and `ti` (arrival time).**
