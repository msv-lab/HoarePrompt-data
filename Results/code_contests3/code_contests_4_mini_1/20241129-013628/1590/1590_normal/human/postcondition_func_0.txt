The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of passengers and an integer `s` representing the top floor number. It then collects the floor numbers and arrival times of each passenger, calculates the total time taken to transport all passengers to their respective floors, and prints this total time. The function handles the cases where the time taken to reach a passenger's floor may need to be adjusted if the current time is less than their arrival time. It assumes valid input within specified constraints.
