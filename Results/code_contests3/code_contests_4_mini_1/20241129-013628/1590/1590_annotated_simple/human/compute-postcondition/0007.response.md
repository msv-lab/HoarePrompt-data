The code appends a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are obtained from input, but the specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that a new tuple has been added to `p`, but we cannot specify the exact content of that tuple without knowing the values of `fi` and `ti`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1; a tuple (fi, ti) has been appended to the list `p`.**
