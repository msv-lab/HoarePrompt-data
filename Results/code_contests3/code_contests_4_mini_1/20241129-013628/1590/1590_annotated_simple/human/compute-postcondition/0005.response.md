According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be increased by 1, making `i` equal to 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
