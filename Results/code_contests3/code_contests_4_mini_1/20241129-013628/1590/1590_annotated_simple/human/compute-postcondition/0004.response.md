The code appends a tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` have been assigned based on user input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. The variable `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `i`, while indicating that a new tuple has been added to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, and a tuple (fi, ti) has been appended to list p.**
