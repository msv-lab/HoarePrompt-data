According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will always execute at least once because the range of `i` will be from 0 to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, `n` is already within the valid range, and `i` is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop. The state of `s` and `p` does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
