The code snippet takes input as two space-separated integers and assigns them to `fi` and `ti` respectively. The previous values of `fi` and `ti` are unknown as they are assigned based on user input. The value of `n` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values based on user input.**
