To analyze the given code snippet, we need to break down the assignment and the effect it has on the variables involved.

1. The variable `i` has a value of `2`.
2. The variable `p` is assumed to be a 2D list (or array), but the specific values in `p` are not provided. We need to assume that `p[i][1]` is defined and will yield a value.
3. The variable `time_passed` is updated by the expression `p[i][1] - time_passed`. This means that `time_passed` will now hold the updated value after the calculation.

Since we do not have the specific value of `p[i][1]` or `time_passed`, we can only state that `time_passed` is updated based on the expression.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `time_passed` has been updated without specifying the new value since it's dependent on the unspecified values in `p` and `time_passed`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2; `time_passed` is updated by the expression `p[i][1] - time_passed`.**
