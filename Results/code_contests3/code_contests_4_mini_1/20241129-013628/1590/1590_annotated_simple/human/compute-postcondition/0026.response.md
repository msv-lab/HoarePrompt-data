According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the limit defined by `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 to continue allowing valid indices. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2.**
