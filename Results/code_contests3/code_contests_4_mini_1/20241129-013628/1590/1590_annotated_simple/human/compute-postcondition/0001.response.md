The variable `p` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, and `p` is an empty list.**
