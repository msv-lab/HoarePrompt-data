`p` is a list that is being appended with a new tuple `(0, 0)`. The previous state of `p` is not specified, but it is stated that it is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple. After the execution of the code, `p` will include the new tuple at the end of the list. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and only the list `p` is affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple in `p`, and now `p` includes the tuple `(0, 0)` at the end.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, `p` is sorted in descending order based on the first element of each tuple in `p`, and now `p` includes the tuple `(0, 0)` at the end.**
