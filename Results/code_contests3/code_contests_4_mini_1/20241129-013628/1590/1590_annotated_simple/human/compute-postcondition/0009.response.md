The values of `fi` and `ti` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, where the input is split into two integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Since `n` is constrained between 1 and 100 and `i` is 2, the output state reflects the input values being assigned to `fi` and `ti`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `fi` is an input integer, `ti` is an input integer**
