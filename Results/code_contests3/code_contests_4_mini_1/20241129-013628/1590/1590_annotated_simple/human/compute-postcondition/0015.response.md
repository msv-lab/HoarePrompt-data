According to the code, the loop will execute `n + 1` times, starting from `i = 0` up to `i = n`. The initial state indicates that `i` is already set to `n`, which means that before the loop starts, `i` is at its maximum value for the first execution of the loop when it begins with `i = 0`. Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is reset to 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

Additionally, the variable `n` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100), which is already guaranteed by the initial state.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `p` is sorted in descending order, `time_passed` is 0**
