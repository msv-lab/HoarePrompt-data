In the provided code snippet, `fi` and `ti` are assigned values based on the result of the `map` function applied to the input from `raw_input()`. The `raw_input()` function accepts a string input, which is then split into two parts and converted into integers by the `map(int, ...)`. The initial state does not specify the input values, but it states that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `i` is 1.

Since the code involves taking input, without specific values given for the input, we cannot determine the exact values of `fi` and `ti`. However, we can state that `fi` and `ti` will be integers as a result of the input processing.

Thus, the output state reflects that `fi` and `ti` are based on user input, while `n` and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `fi` and `ti` are integers from input.**
