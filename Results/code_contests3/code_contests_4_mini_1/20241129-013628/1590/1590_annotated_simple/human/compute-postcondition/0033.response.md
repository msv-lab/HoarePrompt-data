The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its signature. However, it operates on input values based on the given constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ s ≤ 1000. Additionally, it processes a list of passengers, each represented by two integers `fi` and `ti`, where 1 ≤ fi ≤ s and 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000.

Since the function's output is not provided in the prompt, we cannot describe it. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer that the function likely processes the passenger data and returns some kind of result related to the passengers.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on integer values n (1 to 100) and s (1 to 1000), and a list of passenger information consisting of pairs of integers (fi, ti) with constraints (1 ≤ fi ≤ s, 1 ≤ ti ≤ 1000). The exact output of the function is not specified.**
