The code `time_passed += s - p[i][0]` updates the value of `time_passed` by adding the result of `s - p[i][0]`. The variable `i` is currently 2, and `p` is an array (or list) where `p[i][0]` accesses the first element of the third sub-array. The initial values of `s` and `p` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact change to `time_passed` without knowing these values.

Since `time_passed` is updated but we do not have specific values for `s` and `p`, we cannot specify the exact output state of `time_passed`. However, we can state that it has been updated based on the formula given.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2; `time_passed` is updated by adding `s - p[i][0]`.**
