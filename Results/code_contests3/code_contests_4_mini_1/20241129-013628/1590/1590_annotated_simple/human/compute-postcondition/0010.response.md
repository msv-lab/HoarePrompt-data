The code `p.append((fi, ti))` appends a tuple containing the values of `fi` and `ti` to the list `p`. The values of `fi` and `ti` are provided as inputs, and their specific values will determine the content that is appended to `p`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and `i` also stays the same. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `i`, along with the addition of the tuple `(fi, ti)` to the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `p` now contains the tuple (fi, ti)**
