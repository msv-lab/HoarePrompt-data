The values of `n` and `s` are assigned from the input provided by `raw_input`, where they are parsed as integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100 and `s` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000. Since the actual input values are not provided, we cannot define the exact values of `n` and `s` after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000 and they are now assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000 and they are now assigned the values from the input.**
