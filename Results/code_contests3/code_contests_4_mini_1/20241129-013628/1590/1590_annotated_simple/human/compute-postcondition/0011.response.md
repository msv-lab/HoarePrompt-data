The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. During each iteration, a tuple `(fi, ti)` is read from input and appended to the list `p`. After all iterations, the list `p` will contain `n` tuples, each representing the input pairs collected during the loop execution.

If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute exactly `n` times and `p` will contain `n` tuples. The variable `i` will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations, and after the loop execution, `i` will be `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is `n`, and `p` contains `n` tuples of the form (fi, ti).**
