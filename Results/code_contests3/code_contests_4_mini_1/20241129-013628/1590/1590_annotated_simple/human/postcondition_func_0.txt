The function accepts no parameters directly but reads two integers `n` (the number of passengers) and `s` (the starting position), and then a list of `n` tuples containing passenger information `(fi, ti)`, where `fi` is the position and `ti` is the time constraint for each passenger. It calculates the total time passed based on these inputs, adjusting for time constraints, and prints this total time. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or where all time constraints are met without additional time passed.
