To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the lexicographically m-th permutation of length n in the set of permutations having the maximum possible value of a function f(p). The function f(p) is defined by a specific sum involving the permutation elements. The constraints are provided for two subproblems, with n being between 1 and 50.

### Given Program:
```python
from math import factorial

(a, b) = raw_input().split()
n = int(a)
i = int(b)
i = i - 1
p = range(1, n + 1)
for k in range(1, n + 1):
    f = factorial(n - k)
    d = i // f
    (print(p[d]),)
    p.remove(p[d])
    i = i % f
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `m`, and computes and prints the m-th permutation of the sequence of integers from 1 to n, based on the factorial number system. However, it does not return any value and assumes valid input, which could lead to issues if the input is outside the specified constraints.

### Analysis:
1. **Lexicographical Order**: The program aims to find the m-th permutation in lexicographical order. The method used (factorial number system) is appropriate for generating permutations in such an order.
  
2. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads input using `raw_input()`, which is valid for Python 2 but not for Python 3 (it should be replaced with `input()`).
   - It assumes that the input is valid (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), but there are no checks for validity. This could lead to out-of-bounds errors if the input is not within the expected range.

3. **Permutation Indexing**: 
   - The logic for determining the index of the permutation using factorials seems correct, as it gradually reduces the problem size.
   - The decrement of `i` (from `m` to `m-1`) is correctly handled for zero-based indexing.

4. **Output**: The program prints each element of the permutation during the construction. However, it should print the entire permutation as a single line at the end, rather than printing each element on a new line.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle invalid input cases. If `m` is greater than the total number of permutations (cntn), it would lead to an error during execution.
- The program does not output the final permutation in the expected format (all numbers in one line).

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints state that the function computes the m-th permutation based on the factorial number system but does not return a value. This aligns with the code behavior. However, the hints do not address the issue of invalid input handling or the output format.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly for every potential case due to its lack of input validation and incorrect output format. Therefore, it has situations where it could fail or behave unexpectedly.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation:
The program does not check for valid input ranges, which could lead to runtime errors. Additionally, it does not print the final permutation correctly as a single output line, which could result in incorrect formatting of the answer. Thus, it fails to meet the problem's requirements comprehensively.
