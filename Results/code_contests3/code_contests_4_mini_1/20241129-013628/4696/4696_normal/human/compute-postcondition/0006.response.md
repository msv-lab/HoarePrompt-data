The value of `f` is assigned the result of `factorial(n - k)`. Given that `k` is 1, `f` will be calculated as `factorial(n - 1)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so `n - 1` is also a non-negative integer, which is valid for the factorial function. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1)**
