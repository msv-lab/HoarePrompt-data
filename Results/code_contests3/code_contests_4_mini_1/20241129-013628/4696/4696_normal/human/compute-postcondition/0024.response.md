The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `m` is a positive integer that must be less than or equal to `cntn`, where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of a function `f(p)`. The output of the function is dependent on these parameters, although the specific output was not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two positive integers, `n` and `m`, with specified constraints and to return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n (a positive integer between 1 and 50) and m (a positive integer not exceeding the number of permutations of length n with maximum f(p)), and returns a result based on these inputs.**
