The code snippet attempts to remove an element from a list `p` at the index `d`. However, since `d` is undefined due to the variable `i` being undefined, the operation cannot be executed successfully. The values of `n`, `k`, and `f` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and the operation cannot be completed due to `d` being undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and the operation cannot be completed due to `d` being undefined.**
