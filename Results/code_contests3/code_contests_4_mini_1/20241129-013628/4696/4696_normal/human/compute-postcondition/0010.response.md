The value of `i` is assigned the result of `i % f`. However, since `i` is not defined, this operation will lead to an error. Therefore, the output state indicates that there is an issue due to `i` being undefined. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `i` is not defined; attempting to compute `i % f` leads to an error due to `i` being undefined.**
