According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again if `k` is increased by 1.

After the current iteration, `k` will be incremented to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must hold that `k` (which will be 3) is less than or equal to `n`. Hence, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
