According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will run from `k = 1` to `k = n`, which means it will execute at least once as long as `n` is 1 or greater. Before the loop starts, `n` is already defined as a positive integer, so it ensures the loop can execute. The variable `k` will start at 1 for the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
