The variable `f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 3, the expression simplifies to `factorial(n - 3)`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `n - 3` will be non-negative, making the factorial operation valid. If `n` is exactly 3, then `n - 3` equals 0, and `factorial(0)` equals 1. If `n` is greater than 3, `factorial(n - 3)` will yield a positive integer value based on the specific value of `n`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `f` is assigned the factorial of `n - 3`, where `n` is a positive integer and thus can lead to various values for `f`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3)**
