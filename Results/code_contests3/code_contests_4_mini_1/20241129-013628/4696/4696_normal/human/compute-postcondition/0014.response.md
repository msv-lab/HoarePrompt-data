The code attempts to print the value of `p` at index `d`. However, since `d` is undefined due to the undefined variable `i`, the output cannot be determined. The values of `n`, `k`, and `f` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and `d` cannot be determined because `i` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and `d` cannot be determined because `i` is undefined.**
