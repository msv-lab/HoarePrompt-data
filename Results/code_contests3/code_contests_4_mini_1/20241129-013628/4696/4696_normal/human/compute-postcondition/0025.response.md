Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn, where cntn is the number of permutations of length n). It computes and prints the m-th permutation of the sequence of integers from 1 to n, based on the factorial number system. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. There are no checks for valid input beyond the assumed constraints, which could lead to issues if the input is outside these bounds. **
