According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
