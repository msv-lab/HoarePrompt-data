The code attempts to execute `print(p[d])`. However, since `d` cannot be computed based on the initial state, it leads to an error or undefined behavior. The variable `p` is also not defined, which further complicates the execution. Overall, the values of `n`, `k`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects that there is an issue with the computation of `d` and possible undefined variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `f` is factorial(n - 1); `i` is not defined; `d` cannot be computed; `p` is not defined.**
