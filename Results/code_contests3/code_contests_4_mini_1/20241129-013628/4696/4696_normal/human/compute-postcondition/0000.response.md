In the provided code, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from `raw_input().split()`. Since `raw_input()` accepts user input and `split()` separates the input into parts, `a` and `b` will take on values based on that input. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input.**
