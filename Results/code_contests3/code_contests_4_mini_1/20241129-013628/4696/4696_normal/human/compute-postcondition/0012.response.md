`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `k` is 2, this simplifies to `factorial(n - 2)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer and must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Therefore, `n - 2` is a non-negative integer. The output state will reflect these calculations. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2; `f` is factorial(n - 2)**
