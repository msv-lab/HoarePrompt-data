The operation `i = i % f` cannot be completed because the variable `d` is undefined, which prevents the execution of the operation. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and the operation cannot be completed due to `d` being undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and the operation cannot be completed due to `d` being undefined.**
