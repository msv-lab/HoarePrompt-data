The value of `i` is decremented by 1. Since `i` is a positive integer based on the input value of `b`, after the execution, `i` will be one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer based on the input value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the input value, `b` is the input value, `i` is a positive integer based on the input value of `b - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on the input value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), `a` is the input value, `b` is the input value, `i` is a positive integer based on the input value of `b - 1`**.
