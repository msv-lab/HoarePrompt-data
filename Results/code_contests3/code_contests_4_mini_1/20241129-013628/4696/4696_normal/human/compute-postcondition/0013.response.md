To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the code snippet provided.

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 2.
- `f` is the factorial of (n - 2).

Now, we introduce the new variable `d`.

The code `d = i // f` will assign to `d` the result of integer division of `i` by `f`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot directly determine the value of `d`.

Due to the lack of information about `i`, the output state will reflect that we cannot calculate `d` due to an undefined variable. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and we cannot determine `d` because `i` is undefined.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `f` is factorial(n - 2), and we cannot determine `d` because `i` is undefined.**
