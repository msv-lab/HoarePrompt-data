In the provided code snippet, `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, where `i` is an unknown variable, and `f` is the factorial of `n - 3`. The value of `f` depends on the value of `n`, which is given as a positive integer. Since the value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the known information about `n`, `k`, and `f`, while also indicating that `d` is determined by `i` and `f`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `f` is factorial(n - 3), `d` is determined by i // f**
