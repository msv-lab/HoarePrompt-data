Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Lexicographical Order**: The problem requires finding the m-th permutation of length n that has the maximum possible value of the function f(p). The program does not ensure that it generates permutations in the order of their values of f(p); rather, it appears to generate permutations based solely on their lexicographical order without considering the values of f(p). 

2. **Output Format**: The function uses `print(p[d]),` which will print each number on the same line separated by spaces, but the expected output format is a single line of numbers separated by spaces. The use of a comma in the print statement is not appropriate for achieving the required output format.

3. **Failure to Calculate Maximum f(p)**: The code does not compute or verify which permutations yield the maximum value of f(p). It assumes that all permutations generated will have the maximum value without checking.

4. **Handling of m**: The program decrements `m` by 1 to adjust for zero-based indexing, but it doesn't account for cases where m exceeds the number of permutations with the maximum f(p), potentially leading to an IndexError or incorrect output.

In summary, the logic of the program fails to ensure that the correct permutation is selected based on the criteria provided in the problem description, specifically regarding the value of f(p) and the handling of output formatting. Thus, it does not fulfill its requirements.
