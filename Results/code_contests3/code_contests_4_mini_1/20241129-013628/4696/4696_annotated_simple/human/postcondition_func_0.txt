The function processes input values `n` and `m` to generate and print the `m`-th permutation of a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. It does not return any value. The input `n` must be a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `m` must be a positive integer within the range of the total number of permutations of length `n`. The function does not handle cases where `m` exceeds the number of permutations, which could lead to an IndexError when trying to access an invalid index in the list.
