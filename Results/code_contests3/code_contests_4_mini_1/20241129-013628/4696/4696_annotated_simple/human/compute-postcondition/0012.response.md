The code assigns the value of `f` to be the factorial of `n - k`. Given that `k` is 2, `f` will be the factorial of `n - 2`. The previous value of `f` was the factorial of `n - 1`, and since `n` is at least 2, we can conclude that `f` will be updated to a new value based on `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `f` is updated to factorial of (n - 2), `d` is assigned the value of `i // (factorial(n - 1))`, `p[d]` has been removed from list `p`, and `i` is assigned the value of `i % (factorial(n - 1))`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `f` is updated to factorial of (n - 2), `d` is assigned the value of `i // (factorial(n - 1))`, `p[d]` has been removed from list `p`, and `i` is assigned the value of `i % (factorial(n - 1))`.**
