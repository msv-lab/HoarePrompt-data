`n` is assigned the value of `int(a)`, where `a` is a user input. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, the value of `n` will now be determined by the integer conversion of the input `a`. Other variables (`m`, `cntn`, `b`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now assigned the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is now assigned the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, and `b` remains unchanged.**
