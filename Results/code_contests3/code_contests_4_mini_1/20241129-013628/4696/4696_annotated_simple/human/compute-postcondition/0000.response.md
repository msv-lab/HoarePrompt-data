The code takes input as a single line and splits it into two variables, `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` will be determined by the user's input during the execution. The initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `b`, only that they will be assigned based on the input. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, where `cntn` is the number of permutations of length `n` with maximum possible value of `f(p)`; `a` and `b` are assigned values from user input.**
