To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: `n` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial of (n - 1); `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(p[d]),
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The variable `d` is defined as `i // f`, which means it is the integer division of `i` by `f`.
2. The result of `d` will depend on the value of `i` and `f`. Since `f` is the factorial of (n - 1), and n is at least 1, `f` will always be a positive integer (1 if n=1, and greater for n > 1).
3. The code attempts to access the element at index `d` of the array or list `p`.
4. The `print(p[d])` statement will output the value at index `d` in `p`.

However, without knowing the specific values of `i` and `p`, we cannot definitively determine the value of `d` or what `p[d]` will be.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that the value printed is dependent on `p[d]`, where `d` is calculated from `i` and `f`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial of (n - 1), `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, and the value printed is p[d].**
