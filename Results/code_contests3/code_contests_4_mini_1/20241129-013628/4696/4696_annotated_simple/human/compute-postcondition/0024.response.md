The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It calculates the number of permutations of length `n`, where `n` is a positive integer constrained to be between 1 and 50. The function then determines `m`, which is a positive integer constrained to be between 1 and `cntn`, where `cntn` represents the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`. After executing the function body, it returns the number of these permutations or some related result based on the values of `n` and `m`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a result based on permutations of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ cntn), where `cntn` is defined as the number of permutations of length `n` with maximum possible value of f(p).**
