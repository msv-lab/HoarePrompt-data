`i` is assigned the value of `int(b)`. Since `b` remains unchanged and its value is unknown, `i` will be assigned the integer conversion of `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now assigned the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, `b` remains unchanged, and `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is now assigned the integer value of `a`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `cntn`, `b` remains unchanged, and `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.**
