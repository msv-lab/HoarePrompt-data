According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making `k` equal to 3. The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`, which means `n` needs to be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
