`f` is assigned the value of `factorial(n - k)`. Since `n` is at least 1 and `k` is 1, the value of `n - k` is at least 0. Therefore, `f` will be the factorial of a non-negative integer (which is defined). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial of (n - 1).

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial of (n - 1)**
