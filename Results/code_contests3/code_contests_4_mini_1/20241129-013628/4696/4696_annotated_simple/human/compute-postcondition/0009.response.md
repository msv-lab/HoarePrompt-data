The code `p.remove(p[d])` attempts to remove the element at index `d` from the list `p`. The value of `d` is already determined to be `i // f`, where `f` is the factorial of `(n - 1)`. Since `n` is at least 1, `f` will be at least 1 as well. 

The impact of the code is that one specific element from the list `p` will be removed, and the rest of the values in `p` remain unchanged. However, we do not have the specific values of `i`, `f`, or the contents of `p`, so while we know the operation is valid, we cannot determine the exact state of `p` after the operation.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the fact that an element at index `d` (which is `i // f`) has been removed from the list `p`, without specifying the contents of `p` or the exact value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `f` is factorial of (n - 1), `d` is assigned the value of `i // f`, and p[d] has been removed from list p.**
