The function accepts two integers, `n` (ranging from 1 to 50) and `i` (adjusted to be zero-based), via input. It calculates the `i`-th permutation of the integers from 1 to `n` using factorial-based indexing. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the elements of the permutation in order. If `i` exceeds the number of permutations for the given `n`, the function may lead to an index error when attempting to access `p[d]`. Therefore, users must ensure that `i` is within the valid range to avoid errors.
