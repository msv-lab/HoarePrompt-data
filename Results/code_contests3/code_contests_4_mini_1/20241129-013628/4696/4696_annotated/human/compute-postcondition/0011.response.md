According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 because the range for `k` is from 1 to `n`, inclusive.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `i` is updated to `i % f`; `k` is 2; `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`; `d` is `(i - 1) // f`; `p[d]` is removed from `p`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
