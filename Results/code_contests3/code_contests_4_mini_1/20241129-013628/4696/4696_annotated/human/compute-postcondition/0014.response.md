The code attempts to print `p[d]`, where `d` is calculated as `i // f`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `d` are dependent on the values of `n` and `i`. Since `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`, it will have specific values depending on the value of `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `f` will take on values based on the factorial of `n-2`. The value of `d` will depend on the unknown integer `i` divided by `f`.

However, without knowing the specific values of `i` and `p`, we cannot determine the exact output or the value of `d`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that we are attempting to access an index `d` in the list `p`, but the specific values remain unknown.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`; `d` is `i // f`, where `i` is an unknown integer; attempting to print `p[d]`.**
