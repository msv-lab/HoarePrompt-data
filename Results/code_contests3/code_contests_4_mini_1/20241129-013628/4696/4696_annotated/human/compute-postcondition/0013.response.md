The value of `d` is assigned the result of the integer division of `i` by `f`. The variable `f` is defined as `factorial(n - 2)`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 50`, `f` will be a positive integer as well for `n ≥ 2`. The value of `i` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `d`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`; `d` is `i // f`, where `i` is an unknown integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`; `d` is `i // f`, where `i` is an unknown integer.**
