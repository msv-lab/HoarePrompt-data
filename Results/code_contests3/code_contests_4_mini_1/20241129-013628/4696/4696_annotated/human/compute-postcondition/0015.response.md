In the provided code snippet, the operation `p.remove(p[d])` attempts to remove an element from the list `p`. The index `d` is calculated as `i // f`, where `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, `f` will be a positive integer (specifically the factorial of `n - 2`). The variable `d` will vary depending on the value of `i` and will be an integer index.

However, without knowing the specific values of `i`, `n`, and the contents of the list `p`, we cannot determine the exact behavior of `p.remove(p[d])`. This operation will remove the element at index `d` in `p`, but the state of `p` after this operation depends on whether `d` is a valid index and the contents of `p` prior to the operation. 

Assuming `d` is a valid index and `p` is a list with enough elements, the output state will indicate that the element at index `d` has been removed from `p`. If `d` is not a valid index (for example, if `d` exceeds the length of `p`), an error would occur, but since the initial state does not specify that, we will assume the operation is successful.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`; `d` is `i // f`, `p` has an element removed at index `d`.**
