The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it relies on the constraints where `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), and `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq cntn\), where `cntn` represents the number of permutations of length `n` with the maximum possible value of `f(p)`. The function processes these values and returns a result based on the provided logic.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly; it calculates results based on the constraints of n (1 to 50) and m (1 to cntn), where cntn is the number of permutations of n. The function returns a value based on these calculations.**
