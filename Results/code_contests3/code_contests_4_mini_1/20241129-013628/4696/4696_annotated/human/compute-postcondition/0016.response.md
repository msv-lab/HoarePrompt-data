The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`. This operation computes the remainder when `i` is divided by `f`. The values of `n`, `f`, and `d` are not directly altered, and the effect of the modulo operation will depend on the specific value of `i` in relation to `f`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `i` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `f` is `factorial(n - 2)`; `d` is `i // f`; `i` is updated to `i % f`.**
