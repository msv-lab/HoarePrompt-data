The value of `i` is updated to `i % f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. Since `i` was previously decreased by 1, its value is now `i - 1`. The exact values of `i` and `f` are not specified, but `f` will always be a positive integer since `n` is at least 1. After performing the modulo operation, `i` will take a value between 0 and `f - 1`. The variables `k`, `d`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `i` is updated to `i % f`; `k` is 1; `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`; `d` is `(i - 1) // f`; `p[d]` is removed from `p`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `i` is updated to `i % f`; `k` is 1; `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`; `d` is `(i - 1) // f`; `p[d]` is removed from `p`.**
