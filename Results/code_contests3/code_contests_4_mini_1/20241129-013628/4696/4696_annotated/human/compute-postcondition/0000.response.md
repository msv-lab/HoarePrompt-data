The code `a, b = raw_input().split()` takes an input line and splits it into two parts, assigning the first part to variable `a` and the second part to variable `b`. The values of `a` and `b` become whatever input is provided, but they are not directly dependent on the values of `n` and `m`. The other variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings split from the input line.**
