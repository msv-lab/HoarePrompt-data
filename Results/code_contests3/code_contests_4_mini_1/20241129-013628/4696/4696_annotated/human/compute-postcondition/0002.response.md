The variable `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`, which is an input string. Since `b` is a string, `int(b)` converts it to an integer. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings split from the input line; `n` is assigned the integer value of `a`; `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings split from the input line; `n` is assigned the integer value of `a`; `i` is assigned the integer value of `b`.**
