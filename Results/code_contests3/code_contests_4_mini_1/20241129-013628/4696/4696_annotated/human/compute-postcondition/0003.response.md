The value of `i` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is an integer derived from the input string `b`. Since the exact value of `i` is unknown, we can only state that `i` is reduced by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings split from the input line; `i` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ cntn; `a` and `b` are input strings split from the input line; `i` is decreased by 1.**
