The variable `d` is assigned the value of `(i - 1) // f`, where `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`. Since `i` is decreased by 1, its previous value is unknown, and without knowing `i` or `n`, we cannot determine the value of `d`. The `print(p[d])` statement attempts to print the value at index `d` of the list or array `p`, but without knowing `d`, we cannot determine the output.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `i` is decreased by 1; `k` is 1; `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`; `d` is `(i - 1) // f`, and we attempt to print `p[d]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `i` is decreased by 1; `k` is 1; `f` is the factorial of `n - 1`; `d` is `(i - 1) // f`, and we attempt to print `p[d]`.**
