Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Lexicographically Maximum Permutations**: The problem specifically requires finding the lexicographically m-th permutation among those that yield the maximum possible value of f(p). The program simply generates permutations based on the factorial indexing method without ensuring that they are the permutations that maximize f(p). In fact, the maximum value of f(p) is achieved when the permutation is sorted in descending order, which the program does not guarantee.

2. **Input Handling and Factorial Calculation**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not compatible with Python 3. Additionally, while it does calculate the factorial for determining the indices, it does not ensure that the index `i` is properly adjusted to account for valid permutations that maximize f(p).

3. **Output Format**: The program uses `print(p[d]),` which can lead to an output format that may not match the expected output format (it outputs elements of the permutation but does not join them into a single line as required).

Due to these reasons, the program does not satisfy the conditions laid out in the problem description for every potential case. It fails to ensure that it is working with the correct permutations that maximize f(p) and doesn't handle output formatting properly.
