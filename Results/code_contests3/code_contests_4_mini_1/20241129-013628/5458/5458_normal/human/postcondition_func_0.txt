The function processes up to 5 datasets of integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7 inclusive, M is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, and S is between 1 and 3000 inclusive. For each dataset, it computes and prints a value based on a dynamic programming approach using a 3D array, with the result being `dp[n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] % 100000`. The function terminates when N, M, and S are all zero.
