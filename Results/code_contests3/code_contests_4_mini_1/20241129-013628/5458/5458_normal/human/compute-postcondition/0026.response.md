The statement `continue` is executed, which means that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, and the execution context remains the same. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values and the fact that we are continuing to the next iteration.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i` is 0, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
