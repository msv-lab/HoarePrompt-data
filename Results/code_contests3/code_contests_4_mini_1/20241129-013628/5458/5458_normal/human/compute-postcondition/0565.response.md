Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to its initial value plus 2 and is not equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
