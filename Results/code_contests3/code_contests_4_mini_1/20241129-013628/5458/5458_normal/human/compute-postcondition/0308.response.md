Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], and `j` is 3. The variable `k` will be equal to `S` after all iterations of the loop. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `S`, then `dp[1][j + 1][S]` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` will be updated according to the values from previous states based on the conditions in the loop.**
