`n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned new values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 0, the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` will be overwritten with the values from the input. The previous state of the variables is no longer relevant after this assignment, so the output state focuses on the new assignments.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `m` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a new input integer greater than or equal to 0**
