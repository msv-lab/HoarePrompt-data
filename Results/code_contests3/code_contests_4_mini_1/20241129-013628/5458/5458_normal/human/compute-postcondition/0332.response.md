According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute one more time. After the current iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
