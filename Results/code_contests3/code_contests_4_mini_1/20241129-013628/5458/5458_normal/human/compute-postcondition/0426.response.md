Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` contains the computed values based on the dynamic programming logic for all valid `i`, `j`, and `k`. Additionally, `j` is greater than `k`.***
