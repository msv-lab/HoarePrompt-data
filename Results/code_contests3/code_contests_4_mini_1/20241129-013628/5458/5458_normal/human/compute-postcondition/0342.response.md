The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves a few operations:

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` performs a bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. This means:
   - If `i` is 0, then `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` is 1.
   - If `i` is greater than 0, then `i + 1` is at least 2, and `2 & 1` is 0.
   
   Hence, `dp[i + 1 & 1]` will either be `1` (if `i` is 0) or `0` (if `i` is greater than 0).

2. The value `j + 1` is simply `j` incremented by 1, which remains valid since `j` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. The value of `k` is given as 3.

The output state will vary based on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is 0: The operation will set `dp[1][j + 1][3] = 1`.
- If `i` is greater than 0: The operation will set `dp[0][j + 1][3] = 1`.

Since the specific values of `j` and the structure or previous state of `dp` are not provided, the output state will reflect the changes based on the conditions described.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][3] = 1` if `i` is 0, `dp[0][j + 1][3] = 1` if `i` is greater than 0.**
