The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array named `dp`. 

The values of the variables are:
- `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3.
- `j` is at least 3, so `j + 1` is at least 4.
- `k` is 2.

Now, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which results in `1` because in binary, `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, and the bitwise AND operation gives `01`.

Therefore, the indexing into `dp` becomes `dp[1][j + 1][k]`, which is `dp[1][at least 4][2]`. 

The line assigns the value `1` to that specific location in the `dp` array. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
