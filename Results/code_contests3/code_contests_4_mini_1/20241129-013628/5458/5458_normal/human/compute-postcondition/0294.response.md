The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining iterations of the current loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
