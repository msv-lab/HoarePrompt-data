The code updates the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the next index for `i`, which can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is odd or even. The value of `j + 1` increments `j` by 1, and `k` remains unchanged.

Since `i` is currently 1, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0`, and `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. Therefore, the update to the `dp` array is:
```
dp[0][3][2] += dp[1][2][k - j] % mod
```
To compute `k - j`, we substitute the values:
```
k - j = 2 - 2 = 0
```
So, the update will involve:
```
dp[0][3][2] += dp[1][2][0] % 100000
```
The variable `dp` is being modified, but without specific values for `dp[1][2][0]`, we cannot determine the exact numerical outcome. However, we know that `dp[0][3][2]` will be updated based on the value retrieved from `dp[1][2][0]`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[0][3][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][2][0] % 100000`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2.**
