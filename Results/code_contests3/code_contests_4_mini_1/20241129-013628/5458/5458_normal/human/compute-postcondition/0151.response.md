The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining iterations of the current loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
