The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multidimensional array `dp`. 

1. The value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` is 3. The expression `3 & 1` evaluates to `1` because the binary representation of `3` is `11` and `1` is `01`, and the bitwise AND results in `01`.
2. The value of `j` is at least 3, so `j + 1` is at least 4.
3. The value of `k` is 3.

Thus, we can summarize the indexing:
- The left-hand side `dp[1][j + 1][k]` becomes `dp[1][j + 1][3]`.
- The right-hand side `dp[1][j][k]` becomes `dp[1][j][3]`.

Since we are not provided with specific values for `j`, we can only say that we are updating the element at index `[1][j + 1][3]` to be equal to the element at index `[1][j][3]`.

The states of other variables (`n`, `s`, and `k`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][j][3]**.
