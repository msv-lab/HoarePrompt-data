The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to `dp` based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive,
- `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive,
- `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive,
- `mod` is set to 100000,
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1],
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `k` is 2.

The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 0 because `i + 1` is 3, and `3 & 1` is 1 (binary 11 & 01 = 01).
`j + 1` will be greater than or equal to 3 since `j` is at least 2.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][j + 1][k]` with the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod`.

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and the specific value of `j` are not given, so the output state remains general. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are utilized without affecting the overall state of those variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is 100000, `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][2] % mod`**.
