The values of the variables do not change due to the `continue` statement, which skips the remainder of the current iteration in a loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[0][5][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][4][1]`.**
