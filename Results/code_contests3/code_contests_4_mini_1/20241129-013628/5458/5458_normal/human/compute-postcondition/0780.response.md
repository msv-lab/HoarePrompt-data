The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. As a result, the values of the variables do not change, but it indicates that we are moving on to the next iteration of a loop.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` must be 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` must be 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
