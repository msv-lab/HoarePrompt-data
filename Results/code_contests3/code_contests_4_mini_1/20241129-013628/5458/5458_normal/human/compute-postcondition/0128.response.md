Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is updated to `dp[0][j][2]`, and the loop continues for the next iteration.***
