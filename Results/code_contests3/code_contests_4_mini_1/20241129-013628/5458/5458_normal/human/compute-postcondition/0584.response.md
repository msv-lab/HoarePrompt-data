Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s - 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further statements, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.***
