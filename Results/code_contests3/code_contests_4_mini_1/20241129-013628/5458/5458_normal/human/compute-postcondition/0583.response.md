Output State: **`j` is greater than `k`; `k` is equal to `s`; `n` is greater than 0; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1`; the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further statements, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
