According to the code, the loop is a `while 1:` loop, which indicates that it will execute indefinitely without any condition to stop it. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, and the value printed is `dp[n`**
