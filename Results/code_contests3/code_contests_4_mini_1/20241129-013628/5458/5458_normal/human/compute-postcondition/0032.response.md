The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific location in the 2D list `dp`. Here, `i` is `0`, so the calculation for the first index becomes `i + 1 & 1`, which results in `0 + 1 & 1 = 1`. The second index `j + 1` increments `j` by `1`, but since `j` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. The third index is `k`, which is `3`.

Thus, the output state indicates that `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to `1`, but without knowing `j`, the exact impact on the `dp` array cannot be fully defined. However, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 3**.
