According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop executes while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
