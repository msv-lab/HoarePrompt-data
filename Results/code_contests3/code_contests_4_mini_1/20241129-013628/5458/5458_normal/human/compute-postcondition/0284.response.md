The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves updating the `dp` array. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the least significant bit of `i + 1`, which will be either 0 or 1. The variable `j` is greater than `k`, and since `k` is 2, `j` must be at least 3. 

1. The left-hand side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` refers to a specific element in the `dp` array based on the computed values of `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`.
2. The right-hand side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` refers to another specific element in the `dp` array.

The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` do not change as a result of this assignment.

Thus, the output state reflects that the specific element of the `dp` array at `i + 1 & 1` and `j + 1` has been updated to the value of the element at `j` for the same `i + 1 & 1` and `k`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` must be at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0.**
