The code snippet updates a multidimensional list `dp` based on the values of the variables involved. 

- The left-hand side of the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` indicates that we're accessing an element in the `dp` array at the index calculated by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1` is at least 1, making `i + 1 & 1` equal to 1 if `i` is odd and 0 if even.

- The right-hand side `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` accesses another element of `dp` using the same method for `i + 1 & 1`, but it uses the value `j` without altering it.

Since `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are only involved in determining the indices of the `dp` array and do not directly change in value, they remain in the same state after the operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and `dp` is updated based on the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and `dp` is updated based on the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
