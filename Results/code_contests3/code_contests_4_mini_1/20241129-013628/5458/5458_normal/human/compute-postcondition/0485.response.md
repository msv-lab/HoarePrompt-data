According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at 1, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which makes `j` equal to 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` should be less than or equal to `m`. Given that `m` is at least 1, it must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 2.**
