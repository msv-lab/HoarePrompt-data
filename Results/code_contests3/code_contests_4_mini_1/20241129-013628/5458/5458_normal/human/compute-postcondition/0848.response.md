The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since `k` is currently equal to `s`, the loop will not execute a second time, as `k` must be less than `s` for that to happen. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, and we break out of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `k` is currently `s`, and we break out of the loop without changes.**
