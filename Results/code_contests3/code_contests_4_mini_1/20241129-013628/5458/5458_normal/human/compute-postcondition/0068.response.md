The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next step in the program flow. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as we continue the process.
