The code assigns a value to a specific element in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The index used for this assignment depends on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The other indices are `j + 1` and `k`.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `k` is 1

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 + 1 & 1`, which is `2 & 1 = 0` (because 2 in binary is 10, and 1 is 01; ANDing gives 00).
- `j + 1` results in `2 + 1 = 3`.
- `k` remains 1.

The code assigns the value at `dp[0][3][1]` to be equal to the value at `dp[0][2][1]`. Therefore, the values of `dp` change, but no specific values are provided for `dp` in the initial state.

Since we don't have specific values for `dp`, but we do have the relationships between the indices, the output state focuses on the relationship established through this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1; `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]**
