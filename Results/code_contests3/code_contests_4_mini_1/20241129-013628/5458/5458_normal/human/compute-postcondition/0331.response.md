Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
