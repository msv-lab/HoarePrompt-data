According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `k` starts at 1, which is the initial value for the loop iterator. Since `k` is initialized to 1, it is ready for the first iteration. 

Additionally, the states of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `dp` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
