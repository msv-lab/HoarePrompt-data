Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to 2, `k` is 1, `dp` contains the computed values based on the dynamic programming logic for all valid `i`, `j`, and `k`, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.***
