The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
