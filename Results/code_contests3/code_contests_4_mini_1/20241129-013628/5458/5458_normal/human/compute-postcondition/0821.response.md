The code snippet assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The affected variables are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `i` can be either 0 or 1, and `j` is at least 3. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 1 (if `i` is 0) or 0 (if `i` is 1). Therefore, the indices for `dp` will depend on the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Since `j` is greater than or equal to 3 and `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values for `dp`. However, the assignment operation itself does not change the states of `n`, `i`, `j`, or `k`. The output state will reflect the unchanged values of these variables along with the operation performed on the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
