According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and the loop iterates from 1 to `s`, which is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased by 1, making it 3, and `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
