The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the current context, and it indicates that we move to the next iteration without modifying any variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `k` is equal to `S`, and no changes occur to `dp` values; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
