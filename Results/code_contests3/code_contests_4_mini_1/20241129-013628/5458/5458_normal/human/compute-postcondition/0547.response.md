The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
