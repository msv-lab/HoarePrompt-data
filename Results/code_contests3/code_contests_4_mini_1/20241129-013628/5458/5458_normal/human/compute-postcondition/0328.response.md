Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of dimensions 2 x (m + 2) with each sublist containing (s + 1) zeros, and `k` is 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, the rest of the current loop iteration is skipped.***
