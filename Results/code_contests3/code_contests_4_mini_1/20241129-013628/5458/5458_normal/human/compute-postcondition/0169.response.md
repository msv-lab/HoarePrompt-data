The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply instructs the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
