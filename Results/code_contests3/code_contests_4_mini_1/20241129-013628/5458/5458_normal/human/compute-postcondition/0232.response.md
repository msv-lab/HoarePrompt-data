Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 3 and 3000 inclusive, and `mod` is set to 100000. If `i` is 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
