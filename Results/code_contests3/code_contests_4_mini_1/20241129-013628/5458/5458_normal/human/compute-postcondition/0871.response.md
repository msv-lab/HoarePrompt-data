The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multidimensional array `dp`. The computation `i + 1 & 1` effectively evaluates as follows:

- Since `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. The expression `3 & 1` evaluates to `1` (as the binary representation of 3 is `11` and 1 is `01`, and the bitwise AND results in `01`).
- Thus, `dp[1][j + 1][k] = dp[1][j][k]`.

The variables `j` and `k` remain unchanged in this context, but `j` is at least 2, meaning that `j + 1` is at least 3.

Overall, the states of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are not directly changed, but we've evaluated an assignment in the `dp` structure. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and the assignment modifies `dp[1][j + 1][k]` to equal `dp[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; dp[1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[1][j][k].**
