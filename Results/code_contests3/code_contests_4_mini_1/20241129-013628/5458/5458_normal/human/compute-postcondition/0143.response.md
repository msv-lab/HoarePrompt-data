According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `s` inclusive. Since `s` is between `1` and `3000`, the loop will execute at least once as long as `s` is at least `1`. 

The variable `k` will start at `1` on the first execution of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time after the first execution, `k` needs to be less than or equal to `s`. Since `j` is `m + 1`, we need to ensure that it doesn't affect the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to maintain the conditions for `s`, and `k` should be initialized to `1`. 

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1**
