Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is modified at either [1][j + 1][2] or [0][j + 1][2] to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` plus `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
