Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is updated to its initial value plus 2, `j` is set to 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
