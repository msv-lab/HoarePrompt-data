Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] initialized to zeros, `i` is 0, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.***
