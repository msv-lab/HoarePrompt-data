The code updates the `dp` array based on its current state, but since `j` is not greater than `k`, which equals `S`, no changes occur to the `dp` values. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, and `dp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and no changes occur to `dp` values as we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
