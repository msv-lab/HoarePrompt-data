The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves setting a value in a multidimensional array `dp`. Here, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. 

First, we evaluate `i + 1 & 1`:
- `i + 1` is `2 + 1`, which equals `3`.
- The binary representation of `3` is `11`, and `1` is `01`. Performing the bitwise AND operation:
  ```
  11
& 01
  ----
  01 (which is 1 in decimal)
  ```
So, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.

Next, we evaluate `j + 1`:
- Since `j` is at least `3`, the minimum value of `j + 1` is `4`.

Now we can substitute these values into the assignment:
- The indices become `dp[1][4][3]`.

Thus, the code sets the value of `dp[1][4][3]` to `1`. The values of other variables `n`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

The Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is set to 1.**
