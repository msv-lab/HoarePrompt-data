Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
