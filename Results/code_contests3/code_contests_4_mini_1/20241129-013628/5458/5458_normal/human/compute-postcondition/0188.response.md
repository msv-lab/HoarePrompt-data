Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, and `mod` is set to 100000. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is modified at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` where `j` is greater than or equal to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
