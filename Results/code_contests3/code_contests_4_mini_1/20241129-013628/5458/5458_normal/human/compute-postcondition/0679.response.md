The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
