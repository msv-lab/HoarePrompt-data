The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
