Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. After all iterations of the loop, `dp` will contain the computed values based on the conditions and updates made during the iterations, reflecting the results of the dynamic programming approach used within the loop.**
