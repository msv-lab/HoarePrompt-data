The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than 2, and `j` is greater than `k`; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
