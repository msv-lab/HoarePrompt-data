Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[3][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for `k` equal to 2 and `s` greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
