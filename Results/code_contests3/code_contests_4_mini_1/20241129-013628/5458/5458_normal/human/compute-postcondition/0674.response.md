Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
