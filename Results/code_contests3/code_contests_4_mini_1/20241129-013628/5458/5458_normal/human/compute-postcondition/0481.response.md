The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. This operation only affects the `dp` array at the specified indices, and no other variables are modified. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment that has occurred, while the initial conditions of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `k + 1`, `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
