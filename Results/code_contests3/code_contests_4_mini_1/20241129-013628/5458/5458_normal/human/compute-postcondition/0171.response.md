The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` updates a specific element in a 3D array `dp`. The variable `i` is currently 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1 (since `1 & 1` is 1). The value of `j` is not specified, but we know it is greater than or equal to `k`. The output state will reflect that `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod`.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod.**
