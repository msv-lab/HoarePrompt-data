According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `m`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be at least `1`. 

Given that `n` is greater than `0` and `i` is already `1`, the loop can execute a second time only if `m` is at least `1`. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute the second time, `m` must remain greater than or equal to `1`, and `j` must be equal to `2` after the first iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**.
