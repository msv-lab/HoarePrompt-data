The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` involves updating the `dp` array based on its previous values. 

1. The variable `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which is `1`. Thus, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is the target for the update.
2. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to 2, so `j + 1` will be at least 3.
3. The value of `k` is not provided, but since `k - j` must be non-negative for the operation to be valid, `k` must be at least `j`.
4. The value of `dp[0][j][k - j]` is retrieved and then taken modulo `mod`, which is `100000`.
5. This value is added to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.

Given these details, the previous state of `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will change based on the computed value, but without specific values for `j` and `k`, we can't determine exact numbers.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes in `dp` based on the operation described.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0, `dp` has had an element assigned the value 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % 100000`**
