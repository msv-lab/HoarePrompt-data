According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is designed to iterate with `k` taking values from `1` to `s` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least `2` and less than or equal to `s + 1`, meaning that it could be equal to `s` or `s + 1`. 

To execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. The current value of `k` must therefore be adjusted to `k + 1`, which will allow the loop to check the next value. 

However, since the loop is set to iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must also be at least `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute again `k` must be incremented to `k + 1`.**
