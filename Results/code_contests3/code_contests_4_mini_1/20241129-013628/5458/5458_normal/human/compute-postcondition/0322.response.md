The code updates the value of `dp` at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), we can evaluate the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- `j + 1` will be some value greater than or equal to `2` (since `j` is at least `1`).

Thus, the assignment `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1` means that the value at this specific index in the `dp` list will be set to `1`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `dp`) remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**.
