According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `s` is at least 1, so the loop has executed at least once. If the current value of `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again.

Since `k` is updated in the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, after the current iteration, `k` will be 2 (if it was 1 in the first iteration) or greater than 2 (if it was more than 1).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is at least 2, and should be less than or equal to `s + 1`**.
