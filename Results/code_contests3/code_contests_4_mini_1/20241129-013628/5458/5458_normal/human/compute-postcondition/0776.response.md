According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `s` is at least 3. Since `k` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented from its current value. 

If `i` is 0, the loop updates `dp[1][4][k]` for valid `k` values, and if `i` is 1, it updates `dp[0][4][k]` based on the previous values of `dp`. The crucial point is that the loop will execute again as long as `k` remains less than or equal to `s`, which is at least 3.

Given that `k` is currently less than or equal to `s`, we can conclude that after the next iteration, `k` will increase by 1. Assuming `k` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2.

Therefore, the updated state must reflect the new value of `k`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
