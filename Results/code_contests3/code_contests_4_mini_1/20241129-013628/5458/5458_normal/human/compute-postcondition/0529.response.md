The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is the initial value of `i` plus 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
