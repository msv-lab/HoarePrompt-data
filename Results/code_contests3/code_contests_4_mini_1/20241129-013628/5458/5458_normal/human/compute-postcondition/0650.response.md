Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and `mod`.***
