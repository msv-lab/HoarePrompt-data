Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to 0, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp[1][j + 1][3]`. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` % mod, but the exact state of `dp` and `j` after this modification cannot be determined.***
