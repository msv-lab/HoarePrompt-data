The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` must be at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
