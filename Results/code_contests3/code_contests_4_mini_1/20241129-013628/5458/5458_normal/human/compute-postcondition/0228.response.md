The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 3 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
