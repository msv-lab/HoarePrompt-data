The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, the output state remains the same as before. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
