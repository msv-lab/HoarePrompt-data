The code assigns the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i + 1 & 1` will depend on the value of `i`: if `i` is 0, then `i + 1 & 1` is 1; if `i` is not equal to 0, then `i + 1 & 1` is 0. The value of `j + 1` is one more than the current value of `j`. Other variables (`n`, `s`, `k`, `m`) do not change in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2; value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
