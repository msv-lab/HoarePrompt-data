Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to 0, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made to the state of the program as there is no else part.***
