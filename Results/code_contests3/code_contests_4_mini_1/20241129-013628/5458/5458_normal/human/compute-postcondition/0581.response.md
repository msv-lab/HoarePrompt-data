Postcondition: ***If `j` is greater than `k`, then since `k` is equal to `s`, the loop continues to the next iteration without executing further statements. The variables `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is less than or equal to `s - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.***
