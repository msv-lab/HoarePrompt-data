The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that we are updating a value in a multi-dimensional list or array named `dp`. The operation adds the value from another part of `dp` to the current position.

Assuming the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are such that:
- `i` is less than `n`
- `j` is less than `m`
- `k` is at least 2 or less than or equal to `s`
- The expression `k - j` is valid (meaning `k` is at least as large as `j`)

The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

After executing the code, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will have a new value which is the previous value plus the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updates made to the `dp` structure:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the new value after adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
