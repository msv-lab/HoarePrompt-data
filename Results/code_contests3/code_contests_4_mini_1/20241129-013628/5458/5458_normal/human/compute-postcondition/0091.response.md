The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one element of the 2D list `dp` to another. 

The variable `i` is used in the calculation `i + 1 & 1`, which indicates that the result will be either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is `0` or `1`. The variable `j` is incremented by `1`, and `k` remains the same.

The states of the other variables `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, and the structure of `dp` are not affected by this assignment, and we do not know the specific values of `i`, `j`, or `k` from the initial state provided.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the assignment has taken place without providing specific values.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
