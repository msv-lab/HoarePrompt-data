Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000. After the loop executes for all values of `k` from 1 to `S`, `dp` will contain the computed values for each `j` and `k` based on the conditions set in the loop. If `i` equals 0, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will depend on the previous values of `dp`. The final values of `i`, `j`, and `k` will be `i` equal to 1, `j` will be `M + 1`, and `k` will be `S`.**
