Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1 if `i` is 0; otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.***
