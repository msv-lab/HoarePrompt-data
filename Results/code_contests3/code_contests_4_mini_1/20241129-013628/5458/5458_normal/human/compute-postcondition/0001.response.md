According to the code, the `while 1:` statement indicates an infinite loop that will always execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute at least once. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive; `mod` is set to 100000.**
