Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` being added to it.***
