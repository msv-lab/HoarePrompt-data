The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves multiple updates based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` needs to be evaluated. Given that `i` is equal to 0, we calculate `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1`, resulting in `1`. 
2. The value of `j + 1` is calculated next. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` is `3`.
3. The value of `k` is already given as `1`.

Thus, we are updating the value of `dp` at index `[1][3][1]` to `1`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) remain unchanged during this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and the value of `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.**
