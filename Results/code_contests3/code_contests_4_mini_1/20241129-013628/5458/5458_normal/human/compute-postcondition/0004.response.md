The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive; `mod` is set to 100000; `n`, `m`, `s` are integers equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
