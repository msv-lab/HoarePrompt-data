Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is updated such that `dp[0][3][2] = dp[0][2][2]` if `j` is greater than `k`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged at 1, 2, and 2 respectively, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
