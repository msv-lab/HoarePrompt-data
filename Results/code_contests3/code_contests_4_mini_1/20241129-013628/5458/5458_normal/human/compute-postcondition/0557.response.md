The provided code snippet assigns the value `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is currently equal to `0`, `j` is equal to `m`, and `k` is `1`, we need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1` and `j + 1`.

1. `i + 1` evaluates to `0 + 1`, which is `1`. 
2. `1 & 1` evaluates to `1` (bitwise AND).
3. `j + 1` evaluates to `m + 1`, where `m` is at least `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`.
4. `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment updates `dp[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`) remain unchanged, and no return values are specified.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1**.
