Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to its initial value plus 2 and is now equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
