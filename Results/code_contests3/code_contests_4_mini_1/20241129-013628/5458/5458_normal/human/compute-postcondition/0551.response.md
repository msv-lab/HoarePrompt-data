Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 while the values of `dp` remain unchanged otherwise. If `i` is not 0, then `i` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, while `j` remains greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3.***
