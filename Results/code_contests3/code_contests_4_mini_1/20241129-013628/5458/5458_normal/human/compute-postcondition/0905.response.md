The `continue` statement is executed, which causes the loop to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration, but does not change any variable values. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as before the statement was executed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; dp[1][j + 1][1] is assigned the value of dp[1][j][1] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
