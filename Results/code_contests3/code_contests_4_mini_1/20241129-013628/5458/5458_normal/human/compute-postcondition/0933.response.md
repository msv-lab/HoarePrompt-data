The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it processes a series of datasets consisting of three integers: `N`, `M`, and `S`. The constraints for these integers are as follows: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, and `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive. The input ends when all three integers `N`, `M`, and `S` are zero, and the function is designed to handle a maximum of 5 datasets.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple datasets of integers, where each dataset consists of three integers `N`, `M`, and `S`, adhering to specified constraints, and continues until the termination condition of all integers being zero is met.

Functionality: **The function processes a maximum of 5 datasets of integers N, M, and S, where N is between 1 and 7 inclusive, M is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, and S is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, terminating when all three integers are zero.**
