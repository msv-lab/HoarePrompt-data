To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over `j` in the range from 1 to `M + 1`. This means that `j` takes values from 1 to `M`, inclusive. Since `M` is between 1 and 2000, the loop will execute as long as `M` is at least 1.

2. **Current State**: Before the loop starts, we have:
   - `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive
   - `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive
   - `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive
   - `mod` is set to 100000
   - `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]
   - `i` is 3
   - `j` is `M + 1`
   - `k` is `S`

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**: The problem states that for the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be at least 2. However, `n` is not directly mentioned in the state variables. The loop's execution is governed by the variable `j`, which will take values from 1 to `M`.

4. **Initial Values**: At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to `M + 1`, which means that it has already been incremented past the range of 1 to `M`. This means that for the loop to execute at all, we need to adjust `j` to start from 1.

5. **State Adjustment**: To ensure the loop executes correctly:
   - `j` should start from 1, which means we need to initialize `j` to 1 instead of `M + 1`.
   - Since `M` is already given to be at least 1, no changes are needed for `M` or any other variable.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `j` starts from 1 for the loop to execute properly.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `k` is `S`, for the loop to execute a third time `M` is at least 1**.
