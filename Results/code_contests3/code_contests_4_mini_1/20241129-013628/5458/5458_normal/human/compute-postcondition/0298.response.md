Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` to 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
