The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the current block of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
