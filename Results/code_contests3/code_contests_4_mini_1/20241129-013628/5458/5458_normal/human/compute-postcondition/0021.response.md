Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] initialized to zeros, `i` is 0, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is an integer such that `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
