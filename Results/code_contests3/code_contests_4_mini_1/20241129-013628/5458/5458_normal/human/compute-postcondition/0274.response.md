Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0, `dp` has had an element assigned the value 1 at index `[1][j + 1][2]`, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the program continues with the variable states unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[0][j][k - j] % 100000`.***
