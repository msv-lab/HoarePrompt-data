The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is now equal to `dp[1][j][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
