The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` do not directly influence the assignment in this context, as they are not involved in the calculation or indexing of the `dp` array. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, which limits the ability to determine concrete changes or results.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to be the same as `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
