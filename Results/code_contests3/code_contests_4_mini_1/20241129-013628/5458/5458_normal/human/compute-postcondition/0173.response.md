Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `j` increases by 1, `k` remains the same, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod`, while `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
