Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000. If `i` equals 0, then `dp` is modified at index [1][j + 1][1] to be 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, with `k` set to 1, and `s` at least 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no modifications are made. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
