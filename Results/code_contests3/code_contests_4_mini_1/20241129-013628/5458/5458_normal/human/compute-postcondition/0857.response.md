The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Since the loop cannot execute again, it will terminate. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration, terminating the loop without any changes to the variables.
