The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array at the specified indices. Here, `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`, and `j + 1` will result in a value that is at least 3 (since `j` is greater than or equal to 2). The value of `k` is fixed at 2. 

Since the initial state indicates that `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, we can infer the following:

1. If `i` is 0, then `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
2. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0` if `i` is odd, and `1` if `i` is even.

Thus, the output state depends on the value of `i`. However, since `j` is at least 2, `j + 1` will always be at least 3, and `k` is always 2. 

The specific indices in the `dp` array being modified will be:
- When `i` is 0: `dp[1][j + 1][2] = 1`
- When `i` is not 0 (assuming it's even or odd): It will either be `dp[0][j + 1][2] = 1` or `dp[1][j + 1][2] = 1`.

However, without knowing whether `i` is 0 or not, we cannot specify the output state fully in terms of `i`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
