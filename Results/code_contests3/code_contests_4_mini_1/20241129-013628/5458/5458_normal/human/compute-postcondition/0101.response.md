The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` while continuing to the next iteration.
