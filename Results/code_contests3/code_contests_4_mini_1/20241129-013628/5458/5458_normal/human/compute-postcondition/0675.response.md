According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
