According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` will be incremented by 1), and `k` will be updated to 3.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3.**
