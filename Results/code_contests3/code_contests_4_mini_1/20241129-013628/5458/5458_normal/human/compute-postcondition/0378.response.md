The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement affects the control flow by skipping the rest of the current loop iteration and moving to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` must be greater than `k` for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` is now `k + 1`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
