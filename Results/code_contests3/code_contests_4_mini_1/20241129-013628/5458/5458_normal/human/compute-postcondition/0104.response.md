The code modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated but depends on the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Since `N`, `M`, `S`, and `mod` are not directly modified by this code snippet, the output state will still include those variables as they were initially. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is set to 100000; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is set to 100000; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
