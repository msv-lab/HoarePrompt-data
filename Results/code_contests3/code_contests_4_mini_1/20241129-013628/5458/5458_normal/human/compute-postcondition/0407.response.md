According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which should fall within the range defined by `xrange(1, s + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Since the loop starts with `k` at 1 and goes up to `s`, and given that `s` is at least 2, the next value of `k` for the next iteration will be `2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the states need to reflect that `k` is now 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
