Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1, while `k` remains 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is at least 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
