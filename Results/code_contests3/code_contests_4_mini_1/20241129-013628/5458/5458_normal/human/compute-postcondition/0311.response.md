To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to evaluate the values of the variables involved in the print statement.

1. We are given that `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, which means `n` will take values from 1 to 7. Therefore, `n ** 2` will take values between 1 and 49.
2. The variable `i` is defined as `N^2`, so `i` will be `N * N`.
3. The expression `n ** 2 & 1` is a bitwise AND operation, which will evaluate to 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd.
4. `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, which means `m + 1` will range from 2 to 2001.
5. `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, so `s` will range accordingly.
6. `dp` is a 2D list with precomputed values.

Now, let's summarize the output based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`:

- The expression `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` accesses an element in the `dp` array. 
- Depending on whether `n` is even or odd, this will either access `dp[0]` or `dp[1]`.
- The output will be the value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` taken modulo `mod`, which is set to 100000.

Since we don't have specific values for `N`, `M`, and `S`, we can only express the output in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` % 100000**
