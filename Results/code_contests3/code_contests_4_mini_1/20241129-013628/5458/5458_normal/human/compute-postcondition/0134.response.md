Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [0][j + 1][k] to 1, with `i` set to 2, `m` greater than or equal to 2, `j` greater than or equal to 2, `k` equal to 2, and `s` greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
