Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is modified with value 1 at indices `1` or `0`, `j + 1`, and `k`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
