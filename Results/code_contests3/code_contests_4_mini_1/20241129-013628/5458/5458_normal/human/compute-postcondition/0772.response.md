Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `dp` is updated accordingly for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no updates occur in this block.***
