The statement assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` taken modulo `mod`. The variables `N`, `M`, and `S` are not affected by this operation, and since `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues without changing any variable values.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the loop continues without changing any variable values; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and the loop continues without changing any variable values; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
