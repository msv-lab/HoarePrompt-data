The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, since `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will continue to execute. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, and `dp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the fact that the loop will continue.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is updated to `dp[0][j][2]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and the loop continues for the next iteration.**
