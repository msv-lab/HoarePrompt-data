Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions involving `j` and `k`. Specifically, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it will be updated based on previous values from `dp` if `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `j` is less than or equal to `k`.**
