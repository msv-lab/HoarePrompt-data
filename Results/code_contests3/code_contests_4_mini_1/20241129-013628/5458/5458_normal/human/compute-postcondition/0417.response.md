Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on the final index after all iterations, `j` is at most `m`, `k` is at most `s`, and `dp` contains the computed values based on the dynamic programming logic for all valid `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
