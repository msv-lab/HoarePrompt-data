Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 7, `m` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `s` is an integer between 1 and 3000, `i` is `n^2`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` contains the computed values based on the last inputs of `n`, `m`, and `s`; the printed output is `dp[n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`.**
