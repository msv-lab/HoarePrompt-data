Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged. If `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
