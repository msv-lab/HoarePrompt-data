Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `i` is 0, `dp` has had an element assigned the value 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][2]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
