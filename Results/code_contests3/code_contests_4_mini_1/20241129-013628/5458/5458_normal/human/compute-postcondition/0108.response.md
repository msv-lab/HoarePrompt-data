According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit given by `n ** 2`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 1. 

Since `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, the possible values of `n ** 2` are between 1 and 49. Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1.

Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` will be 2, and `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] containing computed values based on the dynamic programming logic, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2**.
