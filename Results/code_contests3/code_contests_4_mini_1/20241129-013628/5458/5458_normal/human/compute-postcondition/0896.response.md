According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2, and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which means that `j` will be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least `s`, and `k` is equal to `s`. The `dp` array has been updated based on the conditions of the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, with the specific updates depending on the relationship between `j` and `k`.**
