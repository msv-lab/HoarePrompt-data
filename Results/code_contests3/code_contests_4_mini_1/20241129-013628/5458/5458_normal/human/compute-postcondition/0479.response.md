Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration without any changes to variable values.**
