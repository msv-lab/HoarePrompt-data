Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. The final values in `dp` depend on the conditions within the loop; specifically, `dp` will contain computed values based on the relationships established during the iterations, influenced by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` across all iterations.**
