To analyze the provided code, we will focus on the variables that are directly affected by the operation.

The line of code is:
```
dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod
```

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `0` or `1` based on the value of `i`. This means we are indexing the `dp` list with either `0` or `1` for the first dimension.
2. The expression `j + 1` increments `j` by 1, which will also be used as an index for the second dimension of `dp`.
3. The variable `k` is used as an index for the third dimension.
4. The value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` accesses a specific entry in the `dp` list based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 
5. The result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is taken modulo `mod` (which is 100000).
6. Finally, the result is added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `i`, `j`, and `k`, the impact of the code will lead to an updated state of the `dp` list but without specific values. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the operation performed with the understanding that the values are affected but we cannot specify them exactly.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
