The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` is performing an assignment based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- `i` is either 0 or 1, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `1 & 1` (which is 1) or `0 & 1` (which is 0). Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1.
- `j` is 3, so `j + 1` equals 4.
- `k` is 3, which remains unchanged.

The right-hand side of the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` accesses the `dp` array at the indices determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is computed and then taken modulo `mod`.

The specific values of `dp` and `mod` are not provided, and thus the output can't specify exact numeric results but can describe the state of the variables involved.

The output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
