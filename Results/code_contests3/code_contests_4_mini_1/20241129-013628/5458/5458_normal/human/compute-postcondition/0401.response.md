The code updates the `dp` list at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by assigning it the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The actual values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` is 2 or less than or equal to `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` do not change because they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the condition of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 or less than or equal to `s; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
