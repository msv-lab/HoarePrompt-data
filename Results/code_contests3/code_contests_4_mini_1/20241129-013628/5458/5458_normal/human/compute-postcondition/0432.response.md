Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0, then `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, for `i` greater than 0, `j` remains 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
