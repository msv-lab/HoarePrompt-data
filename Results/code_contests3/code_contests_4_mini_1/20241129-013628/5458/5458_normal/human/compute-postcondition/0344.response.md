The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` can either be 0 or greater than 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 1 (if `i` is 0) or 0 (if `i` is greater than 0), determining the first index of `dp`. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the state of `dp` at the affected indices.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
