According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` can take on a new value within the specified range. The loop is executing over `j` from `1` to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` and `j` is within the range starting from `1`. The loop must continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`.

Since `j` is currently iterating from `1` to `m + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `1`. Given that `j` is currently at `1`, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be `2`. 

Now, we need to check the conditions for `m`. We know that `n` is greater than `0`, `i` is `0`, `s` is greater than or equal to `1`, and `k` is equal to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least `1` so that when `j` becomes `2`, it still falls within the range of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
