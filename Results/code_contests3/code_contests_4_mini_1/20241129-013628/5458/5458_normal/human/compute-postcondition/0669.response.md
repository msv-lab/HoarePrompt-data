The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` implies that we are trying to assign a value from one index of a multi-dimensional list `dp` to another. The expression `i + 1 & 1` uses bitwise AND, which affects the value of the first index. The value of `j + 1` simply increments `j` by 1 for the second index.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` is greater than 0 (but its exact value is not needed),
- `i` is not equal to 0 (exact value not needed),
- `s` is greater than or equal to 1 (exact value not needed),
- `k` is 1,
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1 (exact value not needed),
- `j` is 2,
- `j` is greater than `k` (which is true since `j` is 2 and `k` is 1).

Now, we determine the values after calculating the indices:
- For the first index: `i + 1 & 1` (the result will be either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`).
- For the second index: `j + 1` results in `2 + 1 = 3`.
- The third index remains `k`, which is 1.

Thus, the assignment means that the value in `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][3][1]` will be set to the value at `[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][2][k]`**.
