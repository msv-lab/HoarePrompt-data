According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. The initial state indicates that `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, so this condition is satisfied. 

The loop is currently set to execute for `k` starting at 1, which is appropriate for the first execution. However, since we are verifying the state for the second execution, we need to adjust the state for `k`. As per the provided context, after the first execution, `k` will be incremented, making it 2 for the second execution.

Since we know that `S` is in the given range, we do not need to adjust it for the loop to execute. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, the following states must be reflected: `k` must be 2. 

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
