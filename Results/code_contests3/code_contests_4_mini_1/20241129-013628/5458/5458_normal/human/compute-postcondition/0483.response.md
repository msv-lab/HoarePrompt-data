Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least `k + 1`, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the variables. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
