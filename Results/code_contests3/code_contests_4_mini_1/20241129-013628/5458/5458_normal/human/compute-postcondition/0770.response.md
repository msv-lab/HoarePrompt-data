The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` equals 2, and `2 & 1` results in 0. Therefore, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects that `dp[0][j + 1][k]` now holds the same value as `dp[0][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
