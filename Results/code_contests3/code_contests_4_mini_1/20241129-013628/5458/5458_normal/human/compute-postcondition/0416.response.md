Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2. The `dp` array is fully updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, with values reflecting the computed states across all iterations of the loop. Specifically, `dp` will contain the results of the dynamic programming logic applied for all valid indices.**
