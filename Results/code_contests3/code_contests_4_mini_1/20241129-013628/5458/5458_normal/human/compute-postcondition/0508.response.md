According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than 3. Since `k` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, `k` will become 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than 4**.
