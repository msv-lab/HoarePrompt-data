According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `k` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
