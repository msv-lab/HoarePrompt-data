Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 2. If `i` is 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
