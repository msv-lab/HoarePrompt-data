According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, so the loop can execute again as long as `k` is less than `s`. 

Since `k` increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased to 2 (if it was 1 in the last iteration) and `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
