The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop where this statement is located. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
