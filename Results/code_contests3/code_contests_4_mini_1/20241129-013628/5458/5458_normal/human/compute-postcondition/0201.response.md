The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies an element in a multi-dimensional array `dp`. In this equation, the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

- The value of `i + 1 & 1` will affect the first index of `dp`, where `i` can take values based on the range of `N` (1 to 7). The expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd.
- The second index `j + 1` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value, which is based on the range of `M` (1 to 2000).
- The third index `k` remains unchanged and is between 1 and 2 (as `k` must be 2 for the loop to execute a second time).

Since the initial values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided explicitly, the output state will reflect that the operation modifies the `dp` array based on the existing values without specifying the exact changes to `dp`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
