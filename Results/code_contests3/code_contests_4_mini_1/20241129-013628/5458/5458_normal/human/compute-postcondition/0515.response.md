The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which updates the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. However, the specifics of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but their relationships indicate that this operation will affect the state of `dp` at the updated indices. 

Since `k` is 4 and `j` is at least 2 (because `m` is greater than or equal to 2), the operation involves a non-negative value being added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updates to the `dp` array but does not specify the exact values as they depend on the specific conditions met for `j` and prior states of the array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 4, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
