The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves assigning a value from one index of the list `dp` to another index. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is being copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

1. **Understanding `i + 1 & 1`:**
   - The expression `i + 1 & 1` will result in either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. 
   - If `i` is even, it will evaluate to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
   - If `i` is odd, it will evaluate to `0 & 1`, which is `0`.

2. **Understanding `dp` indexing:**
   - Both `j + 1` and `k` are used as indexes in the list `dp`.
   - Since `j` is greater than 1, `j + 1` will always be at least 2.
   - `k` is always 1.

3. **Assignment of values:**
   - The value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` will be assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.
   - The other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and the structure of `dp` remain unchanged.

The output state reflects the assignment operation and the values of the involved variables. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of dimensions 2 x (m + 2) with each sublist containing (s + 1) zeros, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
