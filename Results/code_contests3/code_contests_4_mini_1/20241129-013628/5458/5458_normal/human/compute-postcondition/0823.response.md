Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, and `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time with `k` being 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
