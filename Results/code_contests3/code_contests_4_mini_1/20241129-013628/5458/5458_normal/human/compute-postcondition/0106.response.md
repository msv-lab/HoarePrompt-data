Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. After all iterations of the loop, for each valid pair of `j` and `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the conditions outlined in the loop, reflecting the cumulative calculations of the dynamic programming algorithm specified in the loop code.**
