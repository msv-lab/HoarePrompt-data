According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is either 2 or 3 (since it could be 0 or 1 at the start of the loop, but here it's already been established that `k` must be at least 2). The variable `s` is at least 3, which means the loop can execute again for `k` values up to `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3 for the loop to execute one more time.**
