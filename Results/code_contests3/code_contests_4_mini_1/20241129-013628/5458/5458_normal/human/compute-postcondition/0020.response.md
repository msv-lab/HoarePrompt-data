The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the operation remains valid. The other variables and states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
