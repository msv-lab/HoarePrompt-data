According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, which is `1` because the loop starts from `1`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to `2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `2`, and for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least `2`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k` after all iterations, `j` is 2**
