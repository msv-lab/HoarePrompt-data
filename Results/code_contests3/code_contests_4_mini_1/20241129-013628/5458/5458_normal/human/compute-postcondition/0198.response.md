According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` relative to `s`. The loop iterates starting from `k = 1` up to `k = s`. At the end of the last iteration, since `k` is less than or equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `k` starts at 1 and can go up to `s`, the next value of `k` will be `2`, and this will allow the loop to execute a second time if `s` is at least 2.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
