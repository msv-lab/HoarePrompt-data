According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to 0, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
