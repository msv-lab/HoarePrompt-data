According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `n`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than 0, which means `n ** 2` is at least 1. 

Since `i` is currently either 0 or 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` is currently 0, it will become 1; if `i` is currently 1, it will become 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n ** 2`. 

Therefore, if `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `dp` is updated according to the specified conditions for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
