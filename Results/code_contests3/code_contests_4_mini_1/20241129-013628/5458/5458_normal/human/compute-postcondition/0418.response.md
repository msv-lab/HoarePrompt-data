According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `n`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than 0, allowing `n ** 2` to be a positive integer. 

Given that `i` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on the final index after all iterations, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Thus, `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0, `n ** 2` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute again if `i` is less than `n ** 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute another time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2` before the next iteration, and after the increment, `i` will be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is at most `m`, `k` is at most `s`, and `dp` contains the computed values based on the dynamic programming logic for all valid `i`, `j`, and `k`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
