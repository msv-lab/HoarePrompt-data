To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we analyze the provided details:

1. The loop iterates over `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. 
2. The loop can execute again as long as `k` can increment. Since `k` starts at 1 and goes up to `s`, the next value of `k` for the next iteration will be 2.
3. Given that `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `s` must also be within this range.

Now, considering the current state:
- At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the last value used in the loop, which is `s`. Therefore, we need to increment `k` for the next iteration.
- The next value for `k` will be `k + 1`. Since `k` is currently `s`, for the loop to execute again, `k` will be `s + 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- We need to ensure `k` is updated to `2` (the next value after `1`).

Consequently, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], and `k` is 2**
