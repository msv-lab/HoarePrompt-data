Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` to 1, with `j` equal to 3 and `k` equal to 3.***
