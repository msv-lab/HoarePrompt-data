According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, meaning that it has been incremented from its previous value. Since `j` is currently at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` must be at least 2 to continue looping if `m` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, and `dp` has been updated according to the conditions of the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and all values of `k` from 1 to `s`.**
