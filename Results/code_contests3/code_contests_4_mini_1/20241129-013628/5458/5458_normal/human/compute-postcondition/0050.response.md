The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` has been updated: `dp[0][3][2] = dp[0][2][2]`, `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
