According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value before the next iteration. Since `n` is greater than 1 and `k` equals `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to the next integer. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be increased to `s + 1`. 

However, since the loop condition `for k in xrange(1, s + 1):` means it will not execute again when `k` has already reached `s + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to have executed one more time, `k` would need to be set to `s + 1` for the next iteration, which is already the exit condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, the loop cannot execute again.**
