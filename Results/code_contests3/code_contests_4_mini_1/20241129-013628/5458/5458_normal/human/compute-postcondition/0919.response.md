According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. The state indicates that `k` is currently 2 and the loop executes until `k` reaches `s`. Since `s` is at least 2 (as stated), the loop can execute again if `k` is less than `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1, making it 3. For the loop to continue executing, `s` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 3**
