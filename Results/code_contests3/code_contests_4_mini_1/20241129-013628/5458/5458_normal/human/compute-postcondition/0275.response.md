Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], and `j` is between 2 and 2001 inclusive. The `dp` array has been populated based on the conditions and calculations within the loop, reflecting the results of the dynamic programming process across all iterations.**
