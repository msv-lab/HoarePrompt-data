Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value.***
