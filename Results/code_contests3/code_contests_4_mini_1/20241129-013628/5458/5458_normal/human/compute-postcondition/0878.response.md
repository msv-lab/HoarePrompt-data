The code assigns the value `1` to the multi-dimensional array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is `2`, so `i + 1` is `3`, and `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which results in `1`. The variable `j` is at least `2`, so `j + 1` is at least `3`. The variable `k` is `2`. Therefore, the value `1` is assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][2]`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `j`, `s`, and `k`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value `1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value `1**
