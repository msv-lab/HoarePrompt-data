Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k = 2` specifically setting `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] = 1`. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no updates to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
