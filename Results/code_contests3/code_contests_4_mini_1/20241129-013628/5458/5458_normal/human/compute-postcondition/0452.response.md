According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit set by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been updated based on the loop logic, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is the initial value of `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the next value based on the loop, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the dynamic programming logic, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
