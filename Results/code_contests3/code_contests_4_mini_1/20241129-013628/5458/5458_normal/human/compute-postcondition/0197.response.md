Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is equal to `s`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` does not equal 0, no changes occur to the `dp` values as the loop continues to the next iteration.***
