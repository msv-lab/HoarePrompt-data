Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
