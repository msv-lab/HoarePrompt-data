The values of the variables do not change, and the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] initialized to zeros, `i` is not equal to 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k` and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
