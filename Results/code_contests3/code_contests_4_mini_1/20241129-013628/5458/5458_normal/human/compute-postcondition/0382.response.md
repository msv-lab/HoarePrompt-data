Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is greater than `k`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
