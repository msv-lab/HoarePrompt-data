According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since the loop iterates from 1 to `s`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` would be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
