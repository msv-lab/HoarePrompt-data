The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that a value from a multidimensional array `dp` is being assigned based on the current indices. The calculation of `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1` because of the bitwise AND operation with `1`. The value of `j + 1` will be incremented by `1`, affecting the second dimension index of `dp`. The remaining variable `k` remains unchanged at `3`.

Given that `i` can either be `0` or not equal to `0`, the specific value of `i` will determine the index used in the first dimension of `dp`, while `j` is at least `3`, allowing for the operation without going out of bounds.

Therefore, the output state details the values of `n`, `i`, `s`, `k`, `m`, and `j`, along with the operation taking place with the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
