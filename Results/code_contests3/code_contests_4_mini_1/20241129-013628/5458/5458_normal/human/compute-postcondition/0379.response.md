Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is greater than `k` for the loop to execute a second time. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip the rest of the current loop iteration and `k` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop continues without modification to `k`.***
