The condition states that if `j` is greater than `k`, then the specified index in the `dp` list is updated. However, given that both `j` and `k` are specifically set to 3, the condition `j > k` evaluates to `False` (3 is not greater than 3). As a result, no changes occur in the `dp` list.

Thus, the output state reflects that no modifications were made to the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
