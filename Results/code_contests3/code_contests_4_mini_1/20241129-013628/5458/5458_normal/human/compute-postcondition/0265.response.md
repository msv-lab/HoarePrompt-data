Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000. If `i` is 0, then `dp` has had an element assigned the value 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` when `j` is not greater than `k`.***
