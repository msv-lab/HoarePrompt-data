The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` affects the variable `dp` at the indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1, and `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1, since `1 & 1` is 1. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1, hence `j + 1` is at least 2. The value of `k` is 1, so the operation assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
