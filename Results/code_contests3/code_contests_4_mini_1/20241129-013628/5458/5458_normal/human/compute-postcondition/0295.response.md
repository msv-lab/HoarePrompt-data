Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with `j` and `k` both remaining as 3, while continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur.***
