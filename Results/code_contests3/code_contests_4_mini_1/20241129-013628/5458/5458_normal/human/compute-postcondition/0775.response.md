Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated with `dp[1][4][k] = 1` for valid `k` values. If `i` is 1, then `dp` has been updated with `dp[0][4][k] += dp[1][3][k - 3] % mod` for valid `k` values.***
