Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] initialized to zeros, and `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 3), then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than 3, there are no changes to the values of `dp`, `i`, `N`, `M`, `S`, or `mod`.***
