According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `m + 1`. Since `n` is already greater than 0 and `i` is initialized at 0, these states do not need to be adjusted. However, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is greater than or equal to 1**
