The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of the 3D array `dp`. The index is computed as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1`: This operation takes `i`, adds `1`, and applies a bitwise AND operation with `1`. The result will be either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is `0` or `1`.
- `j + 1`: This takes the value of `j` (which is greater than or equal to 3) and adds `1`, resulting in a value of at least `4`.
- `k`: This is provided as a variable but its specific value is not stated.

The initial state indicates:
- `n` is greater than `0`, which does not directly affect the assignment in the code snippet.
- `i` is `0` or `1`, which will affect the first index of `dp`.
- `j` is greater than or equal to `3`, affecting the second index of `dp`.
- `s` is at least `3`, but this does not affect the output state directly.

Given that the operation assigns `1` to `dp` at the calculated indices, and since `i` can be `0` or `1`, the outputs for the relevant values of `dp` are determined as follows:

1. If `i` is `0`: `dp[1][j + 1][k] = 1`
2. If `i` is `1`: `dp[0][j + 1][k] = 1`

Since specific values for `dp`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, the output state will reflect the possible scenarios based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3; `dp` is modified with value 1 at indices `1` or `0`, `j + 1`, and `k`.**
