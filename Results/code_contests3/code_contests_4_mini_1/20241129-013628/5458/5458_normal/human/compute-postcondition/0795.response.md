According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, meaning `m` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 4, `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 4.**
