In the given code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Here, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `0` or `1`, depending on the value of `i`. The values of `j + 1` and `k` are used as indices into the `dp` array.

- Since `k` is specified as `2`, the assignment affects the `dp` array at index `k = 2`.
- The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, and `S` is at least 2. However, the specific values of `i` and `j` are not given, so we can't determine the exact indices used in the assignment.

The state of `dp` will change at the calculated indices based on the values of `i` and `j`. Given this, the output state is described in terms of the possible updates and the dimensions of the `dp` array.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is updated at indices determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k = 2` where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2] = 1`.**
