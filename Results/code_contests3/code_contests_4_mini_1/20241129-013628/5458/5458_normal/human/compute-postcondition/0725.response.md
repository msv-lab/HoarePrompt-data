Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at the respective indices to 1. Otherwise, `dp` has been updated.***
