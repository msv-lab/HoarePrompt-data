The code snippet assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which corresponds to `dp[3 & 1][j + 1][2]` or `dp[1][j + 1][2]` given that `i` is 2. The value assigned is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, which translates to `dp[1][j][2] % 100000`. 

Given that `mod` is set to 100000, the result will be the value of `dp[1][j][2]` reduced modulo 100000. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `dp` while maintaining the unchanged states of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `m`, `j`, and `k`.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is updated at `dp[1][j + 1][2]` with the value `dp[1][j][2] % 100000`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to 2**.
