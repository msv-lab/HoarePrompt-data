The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop that we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 3 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `i` is 3, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 3; `dp[0][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
