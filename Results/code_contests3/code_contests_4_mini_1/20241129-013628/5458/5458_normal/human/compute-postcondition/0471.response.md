Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
