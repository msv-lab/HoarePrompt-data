According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` can take on values from 0 to `n^2 - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 0, `n^2` will also be greater than 0, which means that there will be at least one iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `n^2 - 1`. 

To summarize:
- `n` is greater than 0, ensuring that `n^2` is at least 1, allowing the loop to execute.
- Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
