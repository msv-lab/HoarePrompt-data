The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change due to this operation, but the flow of execution is modified. Since there is no change in the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, or `dp`, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is at least 2 and less than or equal to `s + 1`; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
