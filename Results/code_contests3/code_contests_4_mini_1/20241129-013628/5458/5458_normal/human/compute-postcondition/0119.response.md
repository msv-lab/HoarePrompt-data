Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
