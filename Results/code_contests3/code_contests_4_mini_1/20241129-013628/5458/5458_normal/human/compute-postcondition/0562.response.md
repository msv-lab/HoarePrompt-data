The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop that it is inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to its initial value plus 2 and is not equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to its initial value plus 2 and is not equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
