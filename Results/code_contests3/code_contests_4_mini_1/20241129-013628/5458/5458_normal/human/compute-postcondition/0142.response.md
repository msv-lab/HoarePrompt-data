According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is determined by the last executed iteration. Therefore, if `j` is equal to `m`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `m`, if it is currently `m`, the next value of `j` will be `m + 1`, and `j` must be less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, and `j` is `m + 1`**
