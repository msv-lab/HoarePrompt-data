The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, or `k`, but it causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Since the initial state indicates that `k` must be 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we can conclude that the loop is proceeding to its next iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
