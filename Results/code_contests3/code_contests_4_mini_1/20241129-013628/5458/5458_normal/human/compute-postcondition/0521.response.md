According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s + 1`. In order for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, as that would allow for `k` to take on a value of 1 during the first iteration. The current state indicates that `k` is set to `s + 1`, which means it needs to be adjusted to match the expected starting value for `k` at the beginning of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, the following states need to be adjusted: `s` must be at least 1, and `k` should be reset to 1 (the starting value of the loop).

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is the initial value of `i` plus 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`**
