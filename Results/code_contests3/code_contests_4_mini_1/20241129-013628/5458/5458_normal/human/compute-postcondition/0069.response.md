Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as we continue the process.***
