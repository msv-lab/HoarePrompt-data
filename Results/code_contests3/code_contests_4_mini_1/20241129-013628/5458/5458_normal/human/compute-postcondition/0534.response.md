According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 2, and for this next iteration to be valid, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
