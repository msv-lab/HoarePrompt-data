The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
