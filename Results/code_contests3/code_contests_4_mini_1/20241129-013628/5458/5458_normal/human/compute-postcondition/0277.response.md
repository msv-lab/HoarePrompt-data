According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s` which is derived from the state containing `S`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, and since `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `s` will also be within this range. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 2, since the first execution will occur when `k` is 1. This means that `s` must be at least 2 to allow for a second iteration. Additionally, the value of `j` being set to 3 is already stated in the initial conditions, but does not impact the loop execution directly.

Thus, for the loop to execute the second time, the current value of `s` must be at least 2, and `k` will be 2 during the second iteration.

State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` must be at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `j` is 3, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
