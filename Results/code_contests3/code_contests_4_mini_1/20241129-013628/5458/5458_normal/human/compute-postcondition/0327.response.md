The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of dimensions 2 x (m + 2) with each sublist containing (s + 1) zeros, `k` is 1, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
