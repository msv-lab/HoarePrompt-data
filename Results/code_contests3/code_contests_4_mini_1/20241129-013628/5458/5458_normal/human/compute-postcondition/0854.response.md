The code assigns the value `1` to the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Since we know that `k` is `s + 1`, the specific value of `k` is not determined from the initial state. Additionally, the loop cannot execute again, which indicates that `i`, `j`, and their respective values are not changing anymore. Thus, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
