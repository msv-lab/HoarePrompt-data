According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, there is a possibility for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
