According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as it iterates from `1` to `s`. 

Given the current state:
- `n` is greater than 0 (this does not affect the loop execution),
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1 (this does not affect the loop execution),
- `s` is greater than or equal to 0 (for the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1),
- `i` is `i + 1` (this does not affect the loop execution directly),
- `j` is 1 (this does not affect the loop execution directly),
- `k` is at most `s` (this is relevant as `k` will start from 1),
- `dp` contains the computed values (this does not affect the loop execution directly).

To ensure the loop executes at least once, the state must guarantee that `s` is at least 1. Additionally, before the loop starts, `k` should be initialized to 1, as the loop will start iterating from `k = 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `dp` contains the computed values based on the dynamic programming logic for all valid `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
