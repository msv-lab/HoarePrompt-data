Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, it remains 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 1, and `dp[0][3][2]` is updated based on `dp[1][2][0] % 100000`, while `j` and `k` remain 2.***
