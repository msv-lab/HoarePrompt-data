Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the next value based on the loop, `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated based on the dynamic programming logic. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.***
