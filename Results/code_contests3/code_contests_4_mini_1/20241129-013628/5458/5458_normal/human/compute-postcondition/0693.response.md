Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is assigned the value 1 for every `k` in the range. If `i` is not equal to 0, then the values of `dp` are updated based on the conditions provided in the loop for all `k` from 1 to `s`.**
