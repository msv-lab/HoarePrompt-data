According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 2, meaning for the loop to execute one more time, `k` would be incremented by 1. Thus, after this iteration, `k` would be 2.

To summarize, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2 and `s` must still be at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
