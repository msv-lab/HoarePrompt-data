Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at `dp[3][j + 1][2]` with the value `dp[2][j][0] % 100000`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to 2.***
