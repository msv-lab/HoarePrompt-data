According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `s` is at least 1. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 and going up to `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, k is 2**
