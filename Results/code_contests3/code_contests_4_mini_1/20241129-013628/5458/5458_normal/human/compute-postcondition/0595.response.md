The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop where the `continue` statement is executed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and `dp` is updated based on the indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
