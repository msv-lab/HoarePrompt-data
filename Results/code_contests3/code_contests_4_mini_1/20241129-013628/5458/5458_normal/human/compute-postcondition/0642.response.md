According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again if `k` can be incremented. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be increased to 2, and the loop can continue as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. 

Thus, to execute the loop a second time, `k` should be 2 and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2**
