The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 or less than or equal to `s; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip the remaining part of the loop iteration.
