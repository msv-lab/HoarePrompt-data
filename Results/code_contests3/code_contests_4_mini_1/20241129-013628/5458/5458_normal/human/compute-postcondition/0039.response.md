Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] initialized to zeros. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1, and if `j` is less than 3, there are no changes to the values of `dp`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 3, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`; if `j` is not greater than 3, the values remain unchanged, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
