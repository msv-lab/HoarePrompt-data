The code snippet takes input values and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `s` using `map(int, raw_input().split())`. The initial state mentions `dp[n]`, but does not provide specific values for `n`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, we only know that these variables are assigned values from the input. 

Since the output state depends on user input and can vary, we conclude that:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are assigned values from input**
