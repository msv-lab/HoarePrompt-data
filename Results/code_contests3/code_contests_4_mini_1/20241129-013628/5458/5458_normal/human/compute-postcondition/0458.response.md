Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is incremented by 1 (hence `i` is greater than or equal to 1), `j` is updated to the next value based on the loop (where `j` is less than or equal to `m`), `k` is 2, and `dp` is updated based on the dynamic programming logic. Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.***
