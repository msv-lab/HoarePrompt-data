The provided code snippet updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

We need to analyze the values involved:
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `k` must be 2.

From the code:
- `i + 1 & 1` resolves to either `1` (if `i` is `0`) or `0` (if `i` is `1`).
- `j + 1` equals `4`.
- `k - j` becomes `2 - 3`, which results in `-1`.

Since `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` accesses `dp[i & 1][j][k - 3]`, this index is invalid if it refers to a negative index unless Python handles it in a specific way that wraps around or defaults.

Thus, the variables impacted are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` which is updated, but the source of the addition (`dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`) might lead to an error or an invalid value due to the negative index.

Therefore, the Output State indicates that the values of `dp` are influenced but highlights the invalid access:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` must be 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with an invalid index access for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.**
