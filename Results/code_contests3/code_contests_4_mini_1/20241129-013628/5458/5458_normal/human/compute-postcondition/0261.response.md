The code `continue` instructs the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop it is in and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `mod` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state, with the additional note that we are skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
