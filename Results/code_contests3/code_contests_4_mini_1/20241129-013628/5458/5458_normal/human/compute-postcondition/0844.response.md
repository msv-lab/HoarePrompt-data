According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `k` must be less than `s` for the loop to execute again. If `k` is currently at its maximum value of `s`, the loop cannot execute again.

Assuming `s` is at least 1 (as `s` is at least 1 for the loop to be able to run), if the loop has executed with `k` being the last valid value (which is `s`), then `k` will increment for the next iteration. 

Thus, if `k` is currently at `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, but then it would exceed `s` and the loop would terminate. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s` at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than `s`, and `k` is currently `s`**
