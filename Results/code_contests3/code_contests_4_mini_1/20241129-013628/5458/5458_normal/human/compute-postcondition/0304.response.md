Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is at least 3, `S` is between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program does nothing.***
