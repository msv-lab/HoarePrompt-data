The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
