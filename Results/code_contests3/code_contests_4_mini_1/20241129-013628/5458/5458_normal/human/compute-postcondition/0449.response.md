To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet:

1. The existing state describes that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.
2. The variable `k` is given as 3, and since `j` is at least 0 (as `m` is at least 1), `k - j` will also be at least 0.
3. The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is fetched and added to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

However, without specific values for `dp`, `j`, and `mod`, we cannot determine precise numerical results, but we can affirm the relationships.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
