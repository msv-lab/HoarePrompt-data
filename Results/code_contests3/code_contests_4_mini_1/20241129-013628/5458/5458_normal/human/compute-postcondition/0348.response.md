The line of code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `k` is 3, which implies that `k - j` will depend on the current value of `j`, which is greater than or equal to 1. The specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are not provided, but we know that they will be updated based on the modular operation.

The output state reflects the changes to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, indicating that it has been updated based on the previous values from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
