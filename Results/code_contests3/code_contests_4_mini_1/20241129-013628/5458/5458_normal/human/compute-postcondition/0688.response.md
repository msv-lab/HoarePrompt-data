The code contains a `continue` statement, which indicates that the current iteration of a loop should be skipped, and control should proceed to the next iteration of that loop. Since the values of the variables are not altered by the execution of the `continue` statement, the output state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
