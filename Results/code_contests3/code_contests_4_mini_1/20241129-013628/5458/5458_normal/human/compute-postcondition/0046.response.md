Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] where `dp[1][3][2]` is now set to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.***
