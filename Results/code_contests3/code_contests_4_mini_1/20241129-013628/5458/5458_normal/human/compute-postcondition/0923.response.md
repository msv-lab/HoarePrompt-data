The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The state of the variables does not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state with an additional note regarding the loop behavior.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 3, `s` is at least 4, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is updated to be equal to `dp[1][j][3] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
