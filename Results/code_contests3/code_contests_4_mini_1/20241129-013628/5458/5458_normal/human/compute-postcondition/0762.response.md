According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. The loop is set to iterate with `j` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, resulting in `j` being 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 3 (since `j` will be 3 in this next iteration). Therefore, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated accordingly for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
