`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `2`, we can calculate the indices for the `dp` array:

- `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1` which equals `1`.
- `j + 1` results in `3`.
- `k` remains `2`.

Thus, the assignment is `dp[1][3][2] = 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] where `dp[1][3][2]` is now set to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is 2 or more, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] where `dp[1][3][2]` is now set to 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2.**
