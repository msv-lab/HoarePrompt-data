Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations. If `j` is greater than or equal to 3, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `dp` remain unchanged.***
