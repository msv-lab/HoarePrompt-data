Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 3 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the `dp` list is updated at indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
