Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1]` and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.***
