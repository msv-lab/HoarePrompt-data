According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must increment to 3. Therefore, `k` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
