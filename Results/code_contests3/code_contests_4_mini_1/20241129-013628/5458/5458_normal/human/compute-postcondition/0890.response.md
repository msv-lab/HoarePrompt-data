The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
