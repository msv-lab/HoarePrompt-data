Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
