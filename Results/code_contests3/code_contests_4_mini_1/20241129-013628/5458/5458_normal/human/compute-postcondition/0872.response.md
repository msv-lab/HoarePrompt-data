The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same. The output state reflects that the loop continues without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
