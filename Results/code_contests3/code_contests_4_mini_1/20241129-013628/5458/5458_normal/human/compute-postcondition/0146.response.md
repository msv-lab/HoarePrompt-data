The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the 2D list `dp`. The variable `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals 1. The variable `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), so `j + 1` will be at least 2. The variable `k` is equal to 1.

Therefore, the assignment modifies the list `dp` at the position `[1][j + 1][1]`, setting that specific element to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is modified at index [1][j + 1][1] to be 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k.**
