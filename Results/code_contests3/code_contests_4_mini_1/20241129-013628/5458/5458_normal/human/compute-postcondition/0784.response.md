Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` must be 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, an invalid index access occurs for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` while updating `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
