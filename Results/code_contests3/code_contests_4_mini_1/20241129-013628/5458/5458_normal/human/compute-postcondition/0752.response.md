According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will iterate for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
