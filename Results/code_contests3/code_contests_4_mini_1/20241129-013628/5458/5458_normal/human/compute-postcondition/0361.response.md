Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop does not continue.***
