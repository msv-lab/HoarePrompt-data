The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Since the loop will not execute again, the values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing further statements within it.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop without executing further statements within it.**
