Output State: **`N` is an integer between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is an integer between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is an integer between 2 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1] initialized to zeros. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`, and all other values remain unchanged; if `j` is not greater than `k`, the values remain unchanged.**
