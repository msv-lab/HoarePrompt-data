Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 1. If `i` is 0, then `i` is updated to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to 1, then `k` remains 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` if `j` is greater than 2.***
