According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since the loop increments `k` by 1 each time it runs, the next value of `k` will be 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to 0, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
