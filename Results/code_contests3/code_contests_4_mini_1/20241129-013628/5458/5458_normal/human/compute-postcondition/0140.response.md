Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, and `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1]. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1, while `i` is set to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is equal to 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][2] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
