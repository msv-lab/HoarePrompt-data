The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and continue with the next iteration. Since no variables are modified, the previous values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 1; `dp[0][3][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][1] and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
