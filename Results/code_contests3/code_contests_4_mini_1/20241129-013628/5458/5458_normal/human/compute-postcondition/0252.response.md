The code `continue` does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `j`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `j` is between 2 and 2001 inclusive, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], `j` is between 2 and 2001 inclusive, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0; execution continues to the next iteration of the loop.**
