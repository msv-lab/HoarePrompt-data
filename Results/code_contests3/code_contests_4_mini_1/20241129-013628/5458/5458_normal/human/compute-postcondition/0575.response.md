Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. In the else case, if `k` is less than `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod plus dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
