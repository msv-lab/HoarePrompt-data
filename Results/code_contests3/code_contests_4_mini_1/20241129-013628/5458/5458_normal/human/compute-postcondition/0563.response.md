Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to its initial value plus 2 and is not equal to 0, `j` is equal to `m`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the `dp` array is updated at index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` with the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` while skipping to the next iteration of the loop.***
