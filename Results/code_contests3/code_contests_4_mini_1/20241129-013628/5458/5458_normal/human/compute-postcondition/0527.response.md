Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is the initial value of `i` plus 2, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations for all valid combinations of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `j` is greater than `k`, and the value of `i` is not equal to 0.***
