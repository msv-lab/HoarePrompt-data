The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0` and `k` is `1`, we can calculate the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1 = 1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `1 + 1`, which is `2`.
- `k` is `1`.

Therefore, the assignment occurs at `dp[1][2][1]`.

The other variables `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value `1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, and `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned the value `1**.
