Postcondition: ***`N` is between 1 and 7 inclusive, `M` is between 1 and 2000 inclusive, `S` is between 1 and 3000 inclusive, `mod` is set to 100000, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions [2][M + 2][S + 1], and `j` is between 2 and 2001 inclusive. If `i` is equal to 0, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, where `k` is 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
