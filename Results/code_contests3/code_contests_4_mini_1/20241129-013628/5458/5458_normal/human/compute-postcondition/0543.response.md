According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1. 

This means that `k` will be 3, and for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `dp` contains the results of the dynamic programming calculations; for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
