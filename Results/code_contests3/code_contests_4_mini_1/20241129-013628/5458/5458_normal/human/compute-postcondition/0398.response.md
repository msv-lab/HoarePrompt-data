According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been updated to the next value in the range, which means it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Given that `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 2 or greater.

Since the loop starts at `k = 1` and goes up to `s`, and `s` is at least 2, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `k` will be set to 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 or less than or equal to `s`**
