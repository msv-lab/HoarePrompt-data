Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions within the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be 1 for valid `k` values. If `i` is 1, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` will be updated according to the previous states of `dp` based on the specified conditions.**
