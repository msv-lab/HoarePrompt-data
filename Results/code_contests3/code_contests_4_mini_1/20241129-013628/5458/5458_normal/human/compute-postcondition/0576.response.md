According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is currently at an unspecified value which is less than or equal to `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `k` is currently at a value `x`, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to `x + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s - 1` (current value of `k` is `s`, then it would not execute again)**
