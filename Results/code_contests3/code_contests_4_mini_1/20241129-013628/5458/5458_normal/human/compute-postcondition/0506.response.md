The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` do not directly affect the outcome of this specific operation. The values of `dp` are being updated based on its previous state. However, since we do not know the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` or `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, we can only describe the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
