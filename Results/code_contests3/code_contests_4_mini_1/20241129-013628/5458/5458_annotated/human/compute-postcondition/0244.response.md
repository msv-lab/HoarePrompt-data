According to the code, the loop is defined to execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1. The value of `j` does not directly affect the execution of this loop, but it is noted that `j` is currently equal to `m`, which means it is not relevant to the current loop's execution.

For the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state of `k` before the first iteration. Since the loop starts at `1`, the initial value of `k` should be set to `1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `k` must be initialized to `1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute**
