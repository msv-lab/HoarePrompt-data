According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, allowing for the loop to execute again. Since `k` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. 

Therefore, if `k` is currently `k`, to execute the loop a second time, `k` must be changed to `k + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged unless specified otherwise.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]], for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be `2` and less than or equal to `s**.
