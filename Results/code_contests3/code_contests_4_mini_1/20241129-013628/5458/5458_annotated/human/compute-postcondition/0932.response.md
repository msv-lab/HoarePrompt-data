Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a 2D array reflecting the combinations of selections based on all iterations from `1` to `m` and from `1` to `s`, the output is `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`, and the loop terminates when `n`, `m`, and `s` are all zero.**
