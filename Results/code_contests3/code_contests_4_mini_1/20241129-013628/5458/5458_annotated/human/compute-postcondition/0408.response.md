The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is `0`, `j` is `3`, and `k` is `3`. 

Calculating the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `3 + 1`, which is `4`.

So, `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value `1`. The previous states of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` are unaffected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, `j` is 3, `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value 1**.
