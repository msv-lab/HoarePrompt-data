The code contains a `continue` statement, which will skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. However, there are no visible changes to the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, or `j`. The `continue` statement does not affect the state of the variables directly; it only alters the flow of control in the program.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
