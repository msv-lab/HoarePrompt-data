Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or 1, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
