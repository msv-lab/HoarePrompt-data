The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` (which is updated), `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and the modular operation with `mod` does not alter the values being used in the addition. As a result, the specific values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `mod` are not directly impacted by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
