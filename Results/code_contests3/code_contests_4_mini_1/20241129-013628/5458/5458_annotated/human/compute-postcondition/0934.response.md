Functionality: ** The function processes multiple datasets consisting of three positive integers N, M, and S, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. It continues processing until N, M, and S are all zero. The function calculates a value based on dynamic programming using a 2D array to reflect combinations of selections and prints the result for each dataset. The function does not take any parameters and does not handle cases where N, M, or S exceed their specified limits during execution. **
