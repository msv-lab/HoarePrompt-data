Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `k` is at least 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it, with `k` remaining equal to 1.***
