The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration immediately. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
