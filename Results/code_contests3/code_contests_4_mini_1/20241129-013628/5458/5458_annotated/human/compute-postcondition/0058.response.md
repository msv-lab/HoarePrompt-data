The line of code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` appears to be an assignment operation, which means it assigns a value from one part of a data structure (likely a multi-dimensional array or list) to another. 

However, the initial state only provides information about the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k`, but it does not provide any information about the structure or initialization of `dp` or its dimensions. Therefore, we cannot determine any specific values for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` because the current values of `i` and `j` are unknown.

Thus, the output state will reflect that the values of `dp` are being updated, but without further information about the specific values of `i` and `j` or the contents of `dp`, we cannot specify any numeric results.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
