According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is within the specified range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, `s` must be at least 2 to allow for a second iteration when `k` is 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
