The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. Since `i` remains 0 and `k` is 1, we can denote `i + 1 & 1` as `1` (since `i` is 0). The variable `j` is incremented by 1, but its specific value is unknown. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1] % mod`. The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the other variables are not affected in this context.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][1] % mod`.**
