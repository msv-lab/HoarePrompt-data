The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is then split and converted into integers. This affects the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, but does not alter the `dp` array since it is not updated in this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values for `n`, `m`, and `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers based on input values**
