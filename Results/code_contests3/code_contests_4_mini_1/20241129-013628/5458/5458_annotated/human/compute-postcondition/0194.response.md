Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration or statement. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program does not proceed with any further action as there is no else part.***
