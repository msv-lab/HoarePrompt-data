According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it can execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 (the first iteration) and `s` is a positive integer, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]] with length `s + 1` for each inner list, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and should be less than or equal to `s`.**
