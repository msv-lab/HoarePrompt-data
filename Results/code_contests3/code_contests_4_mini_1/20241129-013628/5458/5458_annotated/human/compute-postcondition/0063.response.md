Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than 3, no changes are made. In the else case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, and remains unchanged if `j` is less than or equal to 3.***
