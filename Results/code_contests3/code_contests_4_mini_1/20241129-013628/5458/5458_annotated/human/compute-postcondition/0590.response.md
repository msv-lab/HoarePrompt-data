The code snippet uses the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`. Here, we need to evaluate the expression based on the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The operation `1 & 1` results in 1 because the bitwise AND between the two binary representations of 1 is still 1. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is the target position in the `dp` array.
2. The variable `j` is at least 1, so `j + 1` will also be at least 2, meaning the second index will be at least 2.
3. The variable `k` is at least 1, so the third index will also be at least 1.
4. The operation assigns the value of `1` to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. 

Other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and the previous values of `dp` do not affect the assignment operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is 1 or greater, `i` is 0; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
