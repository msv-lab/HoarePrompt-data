According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `k`, which ranges from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and it must remain within the bounds of `s`. Therefore, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
