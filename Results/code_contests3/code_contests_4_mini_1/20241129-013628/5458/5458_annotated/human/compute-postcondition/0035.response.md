The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers; `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
