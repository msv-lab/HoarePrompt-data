According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `k` must start at 1 and go up to `s`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and `s` is a positive integer, the initial state of `k` is 1 when the loop starts.

For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m` and `j` is 2, which implies that `j` is already set to 2 before the second iteration starts. 

Therefore, the relevant states that need to be adjusted or clarified are:
- `k` starts at 1.
- For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2 and `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 2 and less than or equal to `m`**
