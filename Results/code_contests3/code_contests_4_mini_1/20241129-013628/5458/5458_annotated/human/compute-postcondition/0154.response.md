The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `mod` are not specified, but the operation indicates that we are performing a modulo operation on one of the `dp` values before adding it to another `dp` value. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`) do not change in this step.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `j` is incremented and less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
