According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`**
