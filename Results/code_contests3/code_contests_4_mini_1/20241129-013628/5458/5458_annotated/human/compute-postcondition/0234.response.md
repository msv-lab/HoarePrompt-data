The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the 3D list `dp` at the indices calculated based on `i`, `j`, and `k`. Here, `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` becomes `1`, and the bitwise AND operation with `1` (`1 & 1`) results in `1`. Since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j + 1` would be at least `k + 1`. The variable `k` itself remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment in the `dp` list without changing the other variables. So, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is less than `s`; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than `s`; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now 1.**
