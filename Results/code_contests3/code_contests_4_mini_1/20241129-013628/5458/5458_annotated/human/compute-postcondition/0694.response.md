According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1 and `m` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m` and `j` is 2.**
