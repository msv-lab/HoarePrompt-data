The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to a specific index of a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

1. The index `i + 1 & 1` is calculated. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1`.
2. The index `j + 1` is calculated. Given `j` is `m + 1`, and since `m` is at least `1`, `j` is at least `2`. Therefore, `j + 1` is at least `3`.
3. The index `k` is `2`.

Thus, the assignment is made to `dp[1][j + 1][2]` where `j + 1` is at least `3`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and other variables do not change and are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
