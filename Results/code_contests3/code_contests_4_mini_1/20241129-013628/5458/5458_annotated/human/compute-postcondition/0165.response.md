According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 and goes up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at a value less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

If `k` is currently equal to `s`, the loop will not execute again because it has reached its upper limit. However, if `k` is less than `s`, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 3, and `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
