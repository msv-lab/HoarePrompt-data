The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]` while we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
