According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `k` is 1 and `s` is a positive integer, meaning that `s` is at least 1. Since the loop will execute for `k` values from 1 to `s`, we need to determine the next value of `k` for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `k` will be 2. We must also ensure that `k` does not exceed `s`. 

So, if `s` is at least 2, then the loop will execute again with `k` equal to 2. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
