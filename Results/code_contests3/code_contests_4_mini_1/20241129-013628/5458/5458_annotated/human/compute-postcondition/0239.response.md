The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` indicates that a value is being assigned to a specific index in a multidimensional array or list structure named `dp`. The index for the first dimension is `i + 1 & 1`, and for the second dimension, it is `j + 1`, with the third dimension being `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1` which equals `1`.
- `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is less than `s`, but the specific values are not provided, so we denote them as is.
- The value assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][k]` comes from `dp[1][j][k] % mod`.

Since the specific values of `j`, `k`, and `mod` are not given, we can only describe the output state in terms of the variable assignments.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `i` is 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is less than `s`; dp[1][j + 1][k] is assigned dp[1][j][k] % mod.**
