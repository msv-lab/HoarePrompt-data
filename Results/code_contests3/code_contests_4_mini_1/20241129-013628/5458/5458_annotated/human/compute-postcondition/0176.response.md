According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute for each integer value of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. Since `k` is initialized to `s` before the loop, it must be adjusted to ensure it starts at 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since the condition states that for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, we need to ensure that `j` is appropriately set for the loop to continue. 

To summarize, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `k` should be set to 1 (the starting value for the loop).
- `j` must be less than or equal to `m` for a second execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**.
