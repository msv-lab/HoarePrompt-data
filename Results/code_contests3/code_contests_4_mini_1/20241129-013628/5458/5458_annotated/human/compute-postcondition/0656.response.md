Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 0, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there are no changes made in this block of code.***
