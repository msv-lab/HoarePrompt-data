Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, and `i` is 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur. In the else part, `dp` is updated based on the condition of `j` compared to `k`.***
