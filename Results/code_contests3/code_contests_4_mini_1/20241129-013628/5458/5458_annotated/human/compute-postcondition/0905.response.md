The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
