According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2 (since `k` must be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2**
