The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the element in a 3D array `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables that affect this operation are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is currently `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. Therefore, the first index is `1`.
2. `j` is defined as `m + 1`. Since `m` is at least `1`, `j` is at least `2` (the minimum value when `m` is `1`).
3. `k` is given as `3`.

Based on these calculations, the specific indices in the 3D array `dp` being modified are `[1][j + 1][3]`, where `j + 1` is at least `3` (since `j` is at least `2`).

The operation modifies the value at `dp[1][j + 1][3]` to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1.**
