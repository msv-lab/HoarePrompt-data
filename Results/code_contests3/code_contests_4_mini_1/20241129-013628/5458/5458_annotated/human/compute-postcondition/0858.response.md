Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop will continue to the next iteration. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, there is no action taken and the loop may end or proceed based on other conditions.***
