According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3, and since `m` is at least 3, the next value of `j` would be 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
