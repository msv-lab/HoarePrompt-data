The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the current loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
