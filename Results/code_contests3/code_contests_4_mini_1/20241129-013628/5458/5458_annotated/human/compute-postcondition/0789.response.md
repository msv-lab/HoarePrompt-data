The values of the variables do not change because the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop. Therefore, the output state remains the same, but it indicates that we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer (at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
