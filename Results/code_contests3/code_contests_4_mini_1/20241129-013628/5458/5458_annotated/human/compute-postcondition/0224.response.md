According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over values of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been a positive integer less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Now, if the current value of `k` is `s`, it means that the loop has reached its maximum iteration limit and will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, the state must be adjusted such that `k` is `s + 1`, and the loop body can be executed with `k` having this new value.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be `s + 1`**.
