To analyze the provided code, we note the following:

- `i` is 0, thus `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
- `j` is at least 2, so `j + 1` is at least 3.
- `k` is 1.

Therefore, the assignment is targeting `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

The state of the variables affected by this code snippet would be:

- The value at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to `1` based on the assignment.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state reflects that the `dp` array has been updated while other variables' states are preserved.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1.**
