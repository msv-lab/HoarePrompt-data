Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer (with `s` being at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time), `k` is 2; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the program skips to the next iteration of the loop.***
