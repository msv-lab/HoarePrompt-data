Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is `s + 2`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][s + 3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
