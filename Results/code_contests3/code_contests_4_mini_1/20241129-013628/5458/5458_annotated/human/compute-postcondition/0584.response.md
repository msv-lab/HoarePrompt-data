Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is `m + 1`, and `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
