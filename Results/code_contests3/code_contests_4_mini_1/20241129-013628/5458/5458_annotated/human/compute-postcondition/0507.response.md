Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1 or 0][5][2]` is set to 1; otherwise, there are no changes made to the variables. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][5][2]` remains unchanged due to invalid index access.***
