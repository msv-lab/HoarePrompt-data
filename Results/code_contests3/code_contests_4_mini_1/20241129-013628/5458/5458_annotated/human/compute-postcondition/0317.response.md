According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i` and the number of iterations specified by `n ** 2`. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n ** 2 - 1`. 

Given that `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, `n ** 2` will also be a positive integer, which means the loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is typically initialized to 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- `i` should be initialized to 0.
- The value of `n` must be at least 1, ensuring that `n ** 2` is greater than 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1 (ensuring `n ** 2` is greater than 0)**.
