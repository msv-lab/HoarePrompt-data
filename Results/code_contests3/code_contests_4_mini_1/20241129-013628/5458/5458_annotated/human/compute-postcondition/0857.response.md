The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
