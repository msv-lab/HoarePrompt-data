Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 3 and less than or equal to `s`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
