Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer (at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]` and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.***
