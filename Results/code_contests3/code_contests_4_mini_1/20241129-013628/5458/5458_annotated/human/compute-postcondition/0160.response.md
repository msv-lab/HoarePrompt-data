The values of the variables do not change, but we proceed to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 2 for the second iteration, `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
