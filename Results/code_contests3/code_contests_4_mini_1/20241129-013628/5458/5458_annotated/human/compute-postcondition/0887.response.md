The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `3`. Thus, the calculation for the indices becomes:

- `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` results in `3`.
- `k` remains `3`.

Therefore, the assignment is made to `dp[1][3][3] = 1`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][3] = 1**.
