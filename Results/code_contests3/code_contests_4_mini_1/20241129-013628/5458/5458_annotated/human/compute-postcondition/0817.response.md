Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is `s + 2`. If `i == 0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `j` is at least 4, and we update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
