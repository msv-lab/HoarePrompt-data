According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = m`, so for it to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `j` has already been updated based on the previous loop execution. Since the loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 with each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be one more than its previous value, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is `s`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions set in the loop, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, with `j` being updated to `j + 1`.**
