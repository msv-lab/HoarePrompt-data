Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]] with length `s + 1` for each inner list. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing any variable values.***
