The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with `n` as a positive integer, `m` at least 1, `s` as a positive integer, and `dp` as a matrix of dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
