The values of the variables do not change but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop.**
