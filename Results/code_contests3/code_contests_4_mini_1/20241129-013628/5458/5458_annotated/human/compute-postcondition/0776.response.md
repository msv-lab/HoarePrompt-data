According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, which means the loop has executed for `k = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, the value of `s` must be at least 2, as `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 2**
