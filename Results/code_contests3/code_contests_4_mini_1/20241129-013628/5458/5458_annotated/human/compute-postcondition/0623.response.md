The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which accepts space-separated integers and maps them to the respective variables. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` can be any positive integers as per the initial state. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the impact on `dp` is not specified in this snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and they are assigned values from the input.**
