The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The computation of the indices involves the following:

- `i` is equal to `0`, so `i + 1` equals `1`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`, and since `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is `1`), `j + 1` will be at least `2`.
- `k` is `1`.

Therefore, the value `1` is assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][1]`.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
