The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables directly; it simply skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is contained. Therefore, while the state of variables remains the same, the execution continues to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i` are positive integers; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
