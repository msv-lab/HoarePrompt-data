Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod.***
