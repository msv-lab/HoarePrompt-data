The code does not change the values of any variables; it simply indicates to continue with the next iteration of the loop or to skip the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]` with no change in variable values.**
