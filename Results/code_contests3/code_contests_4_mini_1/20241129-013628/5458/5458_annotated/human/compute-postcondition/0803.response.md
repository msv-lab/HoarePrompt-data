The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to index into the `dp` array. The previous values of `j` and `k` indicate that `j + 1` is at least `s + 3` (since `j` is `s + 2`), and `k` is 1. The specific values of `dp` are not provided, but the operation does not alter the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the assignment operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `s + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
