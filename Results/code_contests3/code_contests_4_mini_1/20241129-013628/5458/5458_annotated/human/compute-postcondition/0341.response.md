According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, after the current iteration, `k` will be 3. 

For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is a positive integer. Since `k` is being updated to 3, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `k` is 3**
