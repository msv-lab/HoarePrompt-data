According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j`, which starts at 1 and goes up to `m`. In the previous iteration, `j` is 2. Since `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute again for `j` equal to 3, provided that `j` is less than or equal to `m`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 3, and `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
