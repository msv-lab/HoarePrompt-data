Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][3]` is updated based on `dp[0][3][0] % mod.***
