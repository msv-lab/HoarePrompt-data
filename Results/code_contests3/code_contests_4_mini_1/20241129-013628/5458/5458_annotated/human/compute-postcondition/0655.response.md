The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
