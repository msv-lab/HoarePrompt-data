The code snippet provided is an assignment to a multidimensional array `dp`. The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that we are setting a value in the `dp` array based on the current state of other indices within the array. 

The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code, as it only modifies the `dp` array. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified, but we know that `k` is 3 from the initial state. The other values (i.e., `i` and `j`) remain unknown but are part of the indexing for the `dp` array.

Since `dp` is being updated, but there are no other specific values provided, we can't definitively express the output state in terms of concrete values for `dp`. However, we can state that one of the values in `dp` has been updated based on the rule provided.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**.
