According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. This means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Since `s` is at least 1, for the loop to continue executing, it must satisfy the condition that `k` is less than or equal to `s` after the increment. Therefore, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again with `k` being 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is `s + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.**
