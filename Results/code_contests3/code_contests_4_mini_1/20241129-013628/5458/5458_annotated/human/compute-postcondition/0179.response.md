The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies a specific element in a 3D list or array `dp`. The indexing is affected by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. `i` is 0, so `i + 1` results in `1`.
2. `j` is at least `1` and is less than or equal to `m`, so `j + 1` will be at least `2`.
3. `k` is `1` and has no change in this operation.

The expression `1 & 1` results in `1`, meaning the first index for `dp` will be `1`. The second index will be `j + 1` (which is at least `2`), and the third index will be `k` (which is `1`). 

Therefore, the specific element at position `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to `1`. The values of the other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`, `i` is 0; `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
