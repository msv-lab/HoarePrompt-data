Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `i` is 0. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state. Otherwise, when `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
