Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the program attempts to update `dp` with an addition operation, which may not be valid due to indexing.***
