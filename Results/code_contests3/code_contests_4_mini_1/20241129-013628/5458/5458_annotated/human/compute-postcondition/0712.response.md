The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
