According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `k`, starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be 3, and `s` must be at least 3, since `s` is a positive integer.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be at least 3**
