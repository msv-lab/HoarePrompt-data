The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state will reflect that no variable values have changed, but we acknowledge that we are continuing in the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
