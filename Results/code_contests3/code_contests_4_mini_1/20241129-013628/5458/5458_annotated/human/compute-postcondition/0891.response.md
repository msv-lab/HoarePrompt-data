Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any operation as there is no else part.***
