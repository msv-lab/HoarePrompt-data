The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` is 1. This means we will access `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1, so `j + 1` will also be at least 2. The variable `k` is 1.

The output state shows that `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is updated at dp[1][j + 1][1] to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to 1.**
