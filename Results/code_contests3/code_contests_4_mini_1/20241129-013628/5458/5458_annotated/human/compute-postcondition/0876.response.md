Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0, then since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
