According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, meaning it will execute while `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be equal to `m`, since the loop runs from 1 to `m + 1`, with `j` starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `m + 1`, which is the termination condition of the loop.

Given that `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `k` is `s + 1`, we need to ensure the state reflects the adjustments for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1`, and `j` is `m + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.**
