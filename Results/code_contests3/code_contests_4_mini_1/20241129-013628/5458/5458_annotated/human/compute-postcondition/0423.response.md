The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value in a 3-dimensional list or array called `dp`. 

1. The value `i + 1 & 1` calculates the value for the first index of `dp`. Since `i` is 1, `i + 1` becomes 2. The bitwise operation `2 & 1` results in 0. Thus, the first index is 0.
2. The value `j + 1` calculates the value for the second index of `dp`. Given that `j` is 2, `j + 1` becomes 3.
3. The value for the third index of `dp` is `k`, which is equal to `s`.

The impact of the code is that it sets `dp[0][3][k]` to 1, but no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s`, and `dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s`, and `dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1.**
