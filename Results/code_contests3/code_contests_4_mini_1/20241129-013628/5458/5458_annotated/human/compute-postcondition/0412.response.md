Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, and `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][3][3]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not make any changes and proceeds accordingly.***
