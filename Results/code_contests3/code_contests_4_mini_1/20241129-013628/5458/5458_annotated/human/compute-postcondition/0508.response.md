According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will be 3. Additionally, since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3**
