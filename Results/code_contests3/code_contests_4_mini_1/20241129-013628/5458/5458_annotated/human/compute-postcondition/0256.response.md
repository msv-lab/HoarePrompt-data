Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is 1, and if `i` is 0, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` remains 1.***
