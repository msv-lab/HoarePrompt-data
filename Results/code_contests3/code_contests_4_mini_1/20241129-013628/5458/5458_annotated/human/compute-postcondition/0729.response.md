According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from `1` to `m + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `j` can take values in that range. Since `m` is at least 1, the loop will start with `j` equal to `1` and will continue until `j` is equal to `m`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` would be `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is currently `m` at the start of the next loop iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, `j` is `m` for the loop to execute one more time**
