Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `k` must be 2 and less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes to the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k`.***
