According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented. Therefore, after the first iteration, `k` will be 2. The loop will execute again as long as `k` remains less than or equal to `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 2 for the second iteration, and `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
