The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is 0, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is 0, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
