The code updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but since `i` is not equal to 0, the calculations will be based on the existing values of `dp`. The value of `k` is 2, so this operation will involve `dp[i & 1][j][2 - j]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
