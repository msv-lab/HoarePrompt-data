The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `dp` reflects the combinations of selections based on all iterations from `1` to `m` and from `1` to `s`; `i` is a positive integer greater than 0; `j` is 1; `k` is 1 and we skip the current iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
