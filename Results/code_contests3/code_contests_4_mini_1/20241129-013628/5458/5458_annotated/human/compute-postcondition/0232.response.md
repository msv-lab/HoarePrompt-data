Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to the values. In the else case, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
