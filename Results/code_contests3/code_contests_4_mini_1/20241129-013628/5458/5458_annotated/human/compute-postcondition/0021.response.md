Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is 1), then the `dp` array is updated at indices `[1][j + 1][1]` to `1` while `i` remains 0. Otherwise, if `i` is 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
