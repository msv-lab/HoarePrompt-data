According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `k` equal to `s`, which means the loop cannot execute again since `k` will be incremented to `s + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be adjusted to `s + 1`, and since `s` is a positive integer, `k` will be incremented to `s + 1` in the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`.**
