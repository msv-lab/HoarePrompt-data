The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2, and the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. Therefore, `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`.**
