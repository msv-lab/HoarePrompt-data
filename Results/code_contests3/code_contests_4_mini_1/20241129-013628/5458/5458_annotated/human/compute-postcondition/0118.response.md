The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the loop is continuing without any modifications to the variable values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and the loop continues without any changes to the variable values.**
