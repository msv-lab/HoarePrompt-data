The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` (not equal to 0), `j` (which is `s + 2`), and `k` (which is at least 1). The operation modifies the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the current state of the `dp` array.

Since `k` is at least 1 and `j` is at least `s + 2`, `k - j` will be non-negative, allowing the access to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Therefore, this code affects the state of the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
