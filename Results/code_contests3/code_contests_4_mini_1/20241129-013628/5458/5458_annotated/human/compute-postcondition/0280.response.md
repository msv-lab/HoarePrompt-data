The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a 3D list `dp` using the expressions `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The variable `i` is initially 0, so `i + 1` is 1, and subsequently `i + 1 & 1` results in 1 (since 1 in binary is 01, and 1 & 1 is 1). The variable `j` is initially greater than or equal to `k`, but we do not know its exact value, so we will keep it as `j`.

Therefore, the indexing into `dp` is `dp[1][j + 1][k]`. The value at this index is set to 1, indicating that this specific position in the `dp` array is being updated.

The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, and the previous values of `j`, `k`, and `i` do not change as a result of this operation, but we have updated the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` are positive integers; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `i` is equal to 0; `j` is greater than or equal to `k`; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
