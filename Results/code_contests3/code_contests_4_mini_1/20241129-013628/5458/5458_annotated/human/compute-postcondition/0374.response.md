According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, `s` is a positive integer, which implies that `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
