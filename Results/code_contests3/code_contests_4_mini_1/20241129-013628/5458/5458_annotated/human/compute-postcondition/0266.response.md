According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop continues to iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3, and for the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` now needs to be less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
