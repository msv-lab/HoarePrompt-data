According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute a second time, the value of `k` must be adjusted to reflect the current iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `k` is `s + 1`, which indicates that the loop has already completed its iterations, as the range is exclusive of the upper bound. 

To ensure that the loop can execute a second time, `k` should be adjusted to `2`, which is the next value after `1` in the loop's range. Additionally, since `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `1`, we can confirm that the range is valid.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2.**
