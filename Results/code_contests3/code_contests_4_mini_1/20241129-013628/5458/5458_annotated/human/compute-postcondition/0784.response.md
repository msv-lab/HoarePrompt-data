Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer (with `s` being at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time), and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to the previous value, while other variables remain unchanged.***
