Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, no action is taken. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
