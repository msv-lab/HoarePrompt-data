Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is equal to `s + 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0, there are no changes to the variables, and we continue to the next iteration.***
