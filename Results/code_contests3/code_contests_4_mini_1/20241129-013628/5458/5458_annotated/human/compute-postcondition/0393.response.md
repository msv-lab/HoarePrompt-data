The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop where we are currently located. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 3, and `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
