According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, starting from 1 and going up to `m`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `j` is currently at its last value in the range, which is `m`, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be `m + 1` after incrementing. The value of `k` remains equal to `s`, and `dp` may be set based on the updated indices.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `m + 1`**
