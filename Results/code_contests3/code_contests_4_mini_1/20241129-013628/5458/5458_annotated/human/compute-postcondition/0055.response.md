According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, which means the current value of `k` is at its second iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` would become 3.

Since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3 (i.e., greater than or equal to `k` after the increment). 

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
