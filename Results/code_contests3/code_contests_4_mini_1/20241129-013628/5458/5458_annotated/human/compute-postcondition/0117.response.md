The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that the value at the specified index in the `dp` array is being assigned from another index in the same array. The specific indices depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Given:
- `i` is not equal to 0, which means `i + 1 & 1` will be evaluated to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd.
- `j` is greater than 1, so `j + 1` will always be at least 3.
- `k` is a positive integer.

This operation affects the `dp` array but does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, or `j` directly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
