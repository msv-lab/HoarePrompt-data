Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is 2 and `k` is less than or equal to `s`), then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, there are no changes to the matrix. If `j` is less than `k`, the matrix remains unchanged. In the else case, `dp` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.***
