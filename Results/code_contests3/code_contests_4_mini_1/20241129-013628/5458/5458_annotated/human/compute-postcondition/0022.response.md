According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is currently 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which means `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2**
