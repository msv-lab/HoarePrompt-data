The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, or `k`. However, it updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is then taken modulo `mod`. 

As a result, the output state reflects the assignment operation without providing specific values for `dp` or `mod`, since they are not defined in the initial state.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
