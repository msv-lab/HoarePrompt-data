The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` impacts the state of the `dp` array. Specifically, it updates the value at index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, after taking it modulo `mod`. 

The `dp` array is affected by this assignment and the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is taken into account for the update, but we do not have the specific values for these indices in the initial state. Therefore, we can only describe the relationship without exact values.

The output state reflects the update of the `dp` array, while noting that the exact values of variables are not disclosed. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
