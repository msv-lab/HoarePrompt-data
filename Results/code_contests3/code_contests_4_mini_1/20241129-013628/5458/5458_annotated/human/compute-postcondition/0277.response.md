According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `k` is currently equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is incremented to `s + 1`. 

Before the loop starts, we know that `k` is equal to `s`, and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be set to `s + 1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1` for the loop to execute one more time**
