According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit set by `m`. The loop executes for values of `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently less than or equal to `m`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. If `m` is at least 1, then the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be `m` or less after incrementing, hence it needs to be less than or equal to `m`.

Thus, the next state will have `j` as `j + 1`, and for the loop to execute again `m` must still be at least `j + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` is `j + 1`, and it must be less than or equal to `m`.**
