According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` in relation to `m`. The loop starts with `j` at 1 and will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is at least 1, and `j` is currently at a value that allows the loop to run again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. If `j` is currently 1, it will become 2 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is 2**
