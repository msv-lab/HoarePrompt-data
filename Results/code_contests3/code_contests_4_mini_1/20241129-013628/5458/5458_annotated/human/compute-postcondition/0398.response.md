According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop runs from `1` to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, indicating that this is the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` will be incremented by 1.

Since `k` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2 (to allow `k` to become 2). After the next iteration, `k` will be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**.
