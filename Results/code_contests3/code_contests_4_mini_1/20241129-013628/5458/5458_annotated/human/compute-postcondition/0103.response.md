The operation assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged in this operation, but the specific values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` depend on their current state. Therefore, the Output State remains as described.

Output State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; `i` is a non-negative integer; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
