According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `k` is currently 2, in the next iteration `k` will be 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 1**
