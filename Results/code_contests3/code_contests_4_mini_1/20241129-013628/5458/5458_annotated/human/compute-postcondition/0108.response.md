According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i`, which is incremented in each iteration. The loop condition is based on `i` being less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute again. 

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if the loop has executed `i` times, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, and after the next increment, it will be `i + 1`. 

To allow for one more execution, `i` must be less than `n ** 2 - 1` at the end of the last iteration. Thus, the modified state will reflect that `i` is now `i + 1`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D array where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` reflects the combinations of selections based on `j` and `k` for all iterations from `1` to `m` and `1` to `s`; `i` is `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
