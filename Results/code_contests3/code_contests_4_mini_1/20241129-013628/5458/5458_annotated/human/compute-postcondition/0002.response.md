In the provided code snippet, the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is split into three parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state gives us the ranges for `N`, `M`, and `S`, but we do not know the specific input values.

Since the variables `N`, `M`, and `S` are used to represent the maximum possible values for `n`, `m`, and `s`, we can conclude that after the execution of the code, `n`, `m`, and `s` will hold the values provided by the input. The output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `s` are now assigned the input positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 7; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 3000.**
