In the given initial state, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. The condition checks if `j` (which is 2) is greater than `k` (which is 3). Since `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any operation as there is no `else` part.

Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 and no operation is performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 and no operation is performed.**
