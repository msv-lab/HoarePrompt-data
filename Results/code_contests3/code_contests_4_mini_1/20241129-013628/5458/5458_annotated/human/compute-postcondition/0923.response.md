The execution of the code does not change the values of the variables since `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, `k`, and `dp[1][4][3]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
