The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the current iteration of the loop we are directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
