The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` updates the 3D list `dp`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i` (since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1 and `1 & 1` is 1). So, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated, where `j + 1` is `4` (since `j` is 3) and `k` is `1`.

The value of `dp[1][4][1]` is set to `1`. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `k`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1.**
