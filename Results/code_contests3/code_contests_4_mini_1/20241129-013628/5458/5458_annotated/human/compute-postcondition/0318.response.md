According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means it will execute if `m` is at least 1. Since `n`, `m`, and `s` are all positive integers, `m` being positive guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still 0, as it is not modified within the loop body.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 1, which is the first value in the range. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1**
