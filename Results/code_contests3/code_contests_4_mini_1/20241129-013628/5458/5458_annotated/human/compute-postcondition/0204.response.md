The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to the `dp` array based on its previous state. 

Here, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which is then taken modulo `mod`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` are not directly altered by this operation. The array `dp` is being modified, but without specific values for `i`, `mod`, and the contents of the `dp` array, we cannot compute exact numeric results.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
