The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` suggests an assignment to a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The operation involves updating the array at the specified indices calculated from `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

However, the values of `i` and `j` are not provided, and we only know that `k` is 2. The specific values of `n` and `m` do not directly affect the assignment since they are not referenced in the code snippet. The output state should reflect that the array `dp` is updated at the specified indices.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
