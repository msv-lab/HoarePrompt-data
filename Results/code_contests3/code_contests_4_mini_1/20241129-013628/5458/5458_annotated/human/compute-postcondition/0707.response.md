Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][3][1]` is modified to be 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
