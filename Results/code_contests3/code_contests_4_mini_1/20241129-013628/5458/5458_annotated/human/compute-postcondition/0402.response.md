The values of the variables do not change but we continue the loop of the nearest enclosing loop or statement where the `continue` is applicable. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 3 and we continue in the most internal loop or statement. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 3 and we continue in the most internal loop or statement.**
