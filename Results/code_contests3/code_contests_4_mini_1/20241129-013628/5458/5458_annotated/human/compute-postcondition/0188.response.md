Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1, `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
