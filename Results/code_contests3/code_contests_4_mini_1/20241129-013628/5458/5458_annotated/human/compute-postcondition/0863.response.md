According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1 and `m` is at least 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since `j` starts from 1, after the last iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `m` must be at least 2 (to allow for `j` to be 2).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 1`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2; the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions evaluated for each `k` from `1` to `s`.**
