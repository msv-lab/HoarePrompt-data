According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will iterate `n ** 2` times. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` will also be a positive integer, meaning that the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the first value it takes before it is incremented during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `i` should be 0.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D array initialized with zeros, `i` is 0**
