Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `k` is equal to `s + 2`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
