The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
