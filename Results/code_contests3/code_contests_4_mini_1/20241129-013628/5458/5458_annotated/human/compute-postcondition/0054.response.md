Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is 2, and `i` can be either 0 or a positive integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 2, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
