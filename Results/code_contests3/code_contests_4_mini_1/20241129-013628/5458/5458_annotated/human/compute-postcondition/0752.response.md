According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be 2 and less than or equal to `s`, and since `k` is incremented in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 3 in the next iteration. Additionally, `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 3 and less than or equal to `s`.**
