The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2, `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
