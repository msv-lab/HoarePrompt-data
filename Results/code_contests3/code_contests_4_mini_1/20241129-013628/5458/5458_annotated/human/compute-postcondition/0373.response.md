Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is updated based on `dp[0][2][0] % mod.***
