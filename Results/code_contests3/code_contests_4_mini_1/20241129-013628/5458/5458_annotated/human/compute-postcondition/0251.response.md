The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves an assignment operation that updates a multidimensional list (or array) based on previous values. The value of `i + 1 & 1` will yield either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. The variables `j` and `k` influence the dimensions of the `dp` array accessed.

Since `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1` will be a positive integer, and `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 based on the parity of `i + 1`. The variable `j` is greater than `k`, which is 1, indicating that the index `j + 1` will always be valid.

The assignment copies the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The states of `n`, `m`, `s`, and other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `k` is 1; `i` is not equal to 0; `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
