According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute if `s` is at least 1. 

Given that `s` is a positive integer, it will be at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute. The variable `k` will take on the value of 1 during the first execution of the loop.

In summary, the states need to be adjusted considering that `k` will start at 1 when the loop executes for the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 3, `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions, for the loop to execute the first time `k` will be 1**
