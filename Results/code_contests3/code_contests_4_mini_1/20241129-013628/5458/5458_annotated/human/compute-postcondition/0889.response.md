The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates an assignment in a multi-dimensional array or list. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices for the assignment.

Initially, we have:
- `n` is a positive integer (which isn't directly affected by the code).
- `m` is at least 2 (not directly affected).
- `s` is at least 3 (not directly affected).
- `k` is 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.

Breaking down the assignment:
1. `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
2. `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which results in `3`.
3. The left-hand side becomes `dp[1][3][3]`.
4. The right-hand side evaluates to `dp[1][2][3]` since `i + 1 & 1` is `1`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `3`.

Thus, the assignment sets `dp[1][3][3]` to the value of `dp[1][2][3]`.

Since the output state does not involve changes to the other variables and only reflects the assignment made, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2; dp[1][3][3] is assigned the value of dp[1][2][3].**
