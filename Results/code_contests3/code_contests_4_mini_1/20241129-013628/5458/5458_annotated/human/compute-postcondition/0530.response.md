Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `i` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[0][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not update any values and continues executing.***
