According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `s`. The loop will iterate as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
