According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `s` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `k` will take on the value of 1 during the first iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `j` do not directly affect the execution of the loop, but we can state the relevant variables as they are.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1 (the first value in range), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` starts at 1 and ends at `s`**
