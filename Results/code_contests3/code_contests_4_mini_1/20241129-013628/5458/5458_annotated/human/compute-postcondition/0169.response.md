The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 3, `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
