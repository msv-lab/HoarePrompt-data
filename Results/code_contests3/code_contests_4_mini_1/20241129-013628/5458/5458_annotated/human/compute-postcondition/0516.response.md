Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated but remains unchanged due to adding 0.***
