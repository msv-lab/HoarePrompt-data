According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. Given that `s` is a positive integer, the loop can execute at least once. The variable `k` will be initialized to 1 for the first iteration. The existing state indicates that `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, `dp` is a 2D array initialized with zeros, and `i` is 0.

Since the loop is dependent on `k`, we can confirm that for the loop to execute the first time, `k` should start at 1. The current state of other variables does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a 2D array initialized with zeros, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
