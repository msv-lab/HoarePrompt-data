Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod` to its previous value.***
