Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `s + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
