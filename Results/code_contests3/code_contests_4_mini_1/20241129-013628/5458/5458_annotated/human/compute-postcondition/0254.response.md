Output State: **The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, where `i`, `j`, and `k` are integers affecting the indexing of the `dp` array. Other variables `n`, `m`, `s` remain positive integers, and `k` is 1. The loop continues if `j` is greater than `k`.**
