The value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Given the initial state, we have `i` as 1, `j` as 2, and `k` as `s + 1`. Therefore, we calculate:

- `i + 1 & 1` results in `2 & 1`, which is `0`.
- `j + 1` results in `3`.

Thus, `dp[0][3][k]` is set to `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[0][3][k]` is set to 1.**
