According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at a certain value, which is less than or equal to `m`. Since the loop progresses by incrementing `j` by 1, the new value of `j` will be one greater than its value at the end of the last iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. If `j` was at its maximum value of `m`, it cannot execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D array where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be updated for the next iteration, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`, and now `j` is `j + 1`.**
