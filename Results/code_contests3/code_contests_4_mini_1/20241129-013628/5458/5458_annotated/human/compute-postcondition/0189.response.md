According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `s`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `k` is currently `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which makes `k` equal to `2`. 

Since `s` is a positive integer and is at least `s`, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least `2` (i.e., `s` must be greater than or equal to `2`).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`**
