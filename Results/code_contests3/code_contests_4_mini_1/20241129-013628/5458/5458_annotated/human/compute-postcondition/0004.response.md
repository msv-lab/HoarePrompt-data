The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 7, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 3000, and `n`, `m`, and `s` are all equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
