According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `1` to `s + 1`, which means it will execute if `s` is at least `1`. Given that `s` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` will be the last value assigned in the loop, which will be equal to `s`. Therefore, before the loop starts, we can set `k` to `1`, and it will progress to `s` throughout the iterations.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1 (the first value for k in the loop), `j` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` will be updated based on the loop conditions.**
