The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns a value of 1 to a specific location in a multidimensional array `dp`. The indices used in this assignment are determined by the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

- For `i`, which is 0, `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which equals 1.
- For `j`, which is 2, `j + 1` results in `3`.
- For `k`, which is 1, the value remains 1.

Thus, the assignment modifies `dp[1][3][1]` to be 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) and their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `dp[1][3][1]` is assigned the value 1.**
