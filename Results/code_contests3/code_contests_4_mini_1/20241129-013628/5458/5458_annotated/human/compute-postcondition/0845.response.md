The code snippet `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves the assignment of the value `1` to a specific location in a multi-dimensional array or list called `dp`. The indices of `dp` are determined by the expressions `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. 

1. `i` is `0`, so `i + 1` is `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, meaning the first index of the array will be `1`.
2. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we denote `j + 1` as an unknown value, which we can refer to as `j + 1`.
3. `k` is `2`, which is directly used as the third index.

Thus, the assignment will set the value `1` in the `dp` array at the indices `[1][j + 1][2]`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` do not affect the assignment directly, and the state of these variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
