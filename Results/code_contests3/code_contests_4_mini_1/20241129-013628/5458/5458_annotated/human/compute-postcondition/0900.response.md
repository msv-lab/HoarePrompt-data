The code assigns the value `1` to the element `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `3`, and `k` is `1`, we can calculate the indices:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `4`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment becomes `dp[1][4][1] = 1`. The previous state of `dp[1][4][1]` is not mentioned, but we are assigning it a value of `1`. 

Since other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k`) are not affected, we maintain their values in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `dp[1][4][1]` is 1**
