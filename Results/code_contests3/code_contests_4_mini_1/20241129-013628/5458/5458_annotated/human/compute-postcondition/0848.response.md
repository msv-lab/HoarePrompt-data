The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we skip any further instructions that would have been executed in the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `i` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
