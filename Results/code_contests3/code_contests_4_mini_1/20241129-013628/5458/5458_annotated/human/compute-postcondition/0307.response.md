Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, and `k` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change in the state of the program. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and is increased by that amount.***
