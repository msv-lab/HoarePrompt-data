Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, and if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is attempted to be updated with a value that may involve an invalid index `k - j`.***
