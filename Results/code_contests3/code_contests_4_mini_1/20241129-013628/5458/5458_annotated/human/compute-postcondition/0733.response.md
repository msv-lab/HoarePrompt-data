The value at the index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. The operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to the bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. Since `i` is initially `0`, `i + 1` equals `1`. Thus, `1 & 1` results in `1`. Therefore, the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`, where `j + 1` is greater than or equal to `2` and `k` is at least `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
