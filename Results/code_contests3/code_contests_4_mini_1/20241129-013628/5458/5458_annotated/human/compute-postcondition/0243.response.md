According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently at its last value, which is `m`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to `m + 1`, and since `m` is the upper limit, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than or equal to `m` but since `j` is currently `m`, it cannot execute again.**
