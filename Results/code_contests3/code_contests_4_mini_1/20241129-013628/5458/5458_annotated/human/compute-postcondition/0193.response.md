The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
