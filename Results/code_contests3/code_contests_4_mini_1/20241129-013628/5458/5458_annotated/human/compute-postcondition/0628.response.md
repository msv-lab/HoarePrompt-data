According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Given that `m` is already stated to be at least 1, the loop can indeed execute. At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to 1 (the first value in the range). Additionally, `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts, and this does not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute are that `j` starts at 1, and the loop can execute with the existing values.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]] with length `s + 1` for each inner list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
