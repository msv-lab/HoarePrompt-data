The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is `s + 2`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
