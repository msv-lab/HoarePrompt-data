According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, which is a positive integer. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. Additionally, since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3 (as `k` will take the value of 3).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 3, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**
