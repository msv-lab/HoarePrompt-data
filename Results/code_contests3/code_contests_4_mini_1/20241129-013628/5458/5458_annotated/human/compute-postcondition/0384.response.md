According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `m` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is 3, and `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions.**
