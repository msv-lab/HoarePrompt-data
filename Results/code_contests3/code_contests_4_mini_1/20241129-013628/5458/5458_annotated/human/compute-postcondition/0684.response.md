According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 to `s`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and since the loop iterates until `s`, we need to increment `k` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
