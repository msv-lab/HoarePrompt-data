According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n ** 2`. The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, meaning the loop has executed either 0 or 1 times. 

Since `i` starts at 0 or 1, and `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment by 1.

If `i` is 0, it will become 1; if `i` is 1, it will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be 2, and `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions met during all iterations of the loops, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
