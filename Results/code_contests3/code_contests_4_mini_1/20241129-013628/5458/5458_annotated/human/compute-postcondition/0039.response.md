Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no actions are taken in the if block. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
