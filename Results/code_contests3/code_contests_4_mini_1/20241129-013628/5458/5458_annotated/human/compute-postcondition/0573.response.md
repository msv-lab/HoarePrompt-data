The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used in the computation. 

- `i` is 0, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- `j` is `m + 1`, and since `m` is at least 1, `j` is at least 2. Therefore, `j + 1` is at least 3.
- `k` is 2.

The previous value for `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is accessed, but since we don't have the specific values of `dp`, we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is taken modulo `mod`.

The values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are not directly affected, and the statement checks if `j` is greater than `k`. Since `j` is at least 2 and `k` is 2, `j` could be greater than or equal to `k`, meaning the assignment may or may not happen depending on the exact value of `m`.

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment and condition check without specific calculations for `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `i` is 0; assigned value to dp[1][j + 1][2] based on dp[1][j][2] % mod.**
