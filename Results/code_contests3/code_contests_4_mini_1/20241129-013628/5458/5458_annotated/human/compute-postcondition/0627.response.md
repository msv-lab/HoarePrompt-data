According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` will also be a positive integer, which means the range for `i` will be from 0 to `n ** 2 - 1`. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `i` should start at 0. The state of `dp` does not directly affect the execution of the loop but ensures that it is initialized properly as specified. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `i` must be 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]] with length `s + 1` for each inner list, `i` is 0**
