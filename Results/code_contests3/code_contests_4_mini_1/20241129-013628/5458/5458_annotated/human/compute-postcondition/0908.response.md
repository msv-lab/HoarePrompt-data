The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, taken modulo `mod`. 

The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` do not directly change from this operation, but the value at the specified index in the `dp` array is updated based on the current state of `dp`. 

Let's break down the assignment:
- The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is modified.
- The value added to it is `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which depends on the existing values in the `dp` array.

As we do not have the specific values of `dp`, we cannot calculate an exact result but can indicate that an update occurs based on the aforementioned indices. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
