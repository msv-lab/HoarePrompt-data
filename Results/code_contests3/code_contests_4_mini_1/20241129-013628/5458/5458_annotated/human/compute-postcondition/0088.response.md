According to the code, the loop will execute while `k` is within the range from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to be executed a second time, `k` must be 2, and since `s` is at least 1, `s` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `i` is a non-negative integer.**
