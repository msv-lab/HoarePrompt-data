According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is a positive integer, `s` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (which is at least 2).**
