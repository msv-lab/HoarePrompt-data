The value at the specified indices of the `dp` array is being assigned the value `1`. The array indices are calculated as follows: `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` (since `i` is `0`), `j + 1` evaluates to `3` (since `j` is `2`), and `k` is `2`. Therefore, `dp[1][3][2]` is set to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 2; `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.**
