The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement following the current one. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 2`, and `dp[0][3][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
