According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the condition of the loop range. The loop will execute for the values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, and for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
