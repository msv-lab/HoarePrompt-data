The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of a loop. Since we are not given the context of a loop, we can only state that we are continuing to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `j` is at least 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
