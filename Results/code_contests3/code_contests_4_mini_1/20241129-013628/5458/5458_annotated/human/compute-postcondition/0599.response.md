Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
