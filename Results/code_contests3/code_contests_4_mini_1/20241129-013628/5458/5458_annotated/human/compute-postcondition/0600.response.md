According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
