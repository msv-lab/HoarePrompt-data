In this case, the `while` loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it will always execute indefinitely because the condition is always true. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is `n^2 - 1`, `j` is `m`, `k` is `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions; the output is `dp[n`**
