According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its previous value, which must be less than or equal to `s` for the loop to execute again. Since `k` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the current value of `k` is such that it must be less than `s`. Therefore, if `k` is currently at its last value, it will change to the next value, which is `k + 1`. 

State: **`n`, `m` are positive integers, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3 (if `k` was 2 before), and `i` is a non-negative integer. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**.
