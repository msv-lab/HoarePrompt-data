Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, `j` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][2]` remains unchanged since `dp[1][4][2]` is incremented by 0 % mod.***
