Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, `i` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If the loop executes again, `k` would be incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated.***
