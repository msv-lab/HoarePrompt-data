According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which implies that `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `m` is at least `s + 2` (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `s` is a positive integer, which means it is at least 1.
- `k` is equal to `s`, but it will be redefined in the for loop.
- `j` is `s + 2` (this does not affect the loop execution).

To ensure the loop executes, `s` must be at least 1, and the loop will start with `k` equal to 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `s + 2`**
