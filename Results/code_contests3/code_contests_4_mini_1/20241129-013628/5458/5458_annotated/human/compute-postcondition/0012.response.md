The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, so the first index of `dp` becomes `1`. The value of `k` is `1`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, allowing for valid indexing into the second and third dimensions of `dp`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated at indices `[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated at indices `[1][j + 1][1]` to `1`, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k**
