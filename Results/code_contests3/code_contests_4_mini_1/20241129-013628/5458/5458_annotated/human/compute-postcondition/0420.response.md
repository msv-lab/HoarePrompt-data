To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute a second time, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the provided state details.

The loop is defined as:
```python
for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We have the following state before the loop starts:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is at least 2
- `s` is a positive integer
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `k` is `s + 1`
- `dp` is updated based on the conditions throughout all iterations of the loops

In this context, the loop starts with `k` initialized to 1 and will iterate while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. The loop will execute a second time if the current value of `k` (after the first execution) is less than `s`.

Since `k` is initially set to `s + 1`, this means that the loop will not execute at all during its first iteration because the starting point of the loop (1) is less than `s + 1`.

For the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that after the first iteration, `k` is set to a value that allows the loop to iterate again. Therefore, we need to adjust the initial state of `k` to ensure it is within the range of 1 to `s` inclusive.

To ensure the loop can execute a second time:
1. After the first execution of the loop, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.
2. Since `k` is initially set to `s + 1`, we can change `k` to `s` to allow the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `k` is actually `s`, which will allow it to execute for the second time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s`, for the loop to execute a second time**
