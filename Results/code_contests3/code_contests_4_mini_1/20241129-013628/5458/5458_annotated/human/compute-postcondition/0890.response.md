The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop (if any) and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 2; `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
