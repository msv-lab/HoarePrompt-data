According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `s + 1`, which means for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. Given that `s` is already stated as a positive integer, this condition is satisfied.

At the beginning of the first iteration of the loop, `k` will take the value of `1` (the starting point of the range). The states `n`, `m`, and `dp` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they do not affect the ability of the loop to run.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute for the first time are:
- `k` is `1` when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` reflects the combinations of selections based on all iterations from `1` to `m` and from `1` to `s`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
