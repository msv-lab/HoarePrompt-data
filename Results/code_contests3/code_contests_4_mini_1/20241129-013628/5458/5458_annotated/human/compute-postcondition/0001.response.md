In this case, the `while` loop is structured as `while 1`, which indicates an infinite loop. This type of loop will always execute as long as the program continues running. Therefore, there is no need to modify any states in order to allow the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000.**
