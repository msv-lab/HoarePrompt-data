The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the remainder of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop, if there is one. As such, the values of all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 5, `k` is 1; `dp[0][5][1]` is equal to `dp[0][4][1]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
