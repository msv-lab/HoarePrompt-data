The values of the variables do not change with the `continue` statement, but we skip the rest of the current iteration in the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
