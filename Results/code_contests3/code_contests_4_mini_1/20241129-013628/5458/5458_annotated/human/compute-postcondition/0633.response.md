Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]] with length `s + 1` for each inner list. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1, while `i` remains 0, `j` is 1, and `k` is 1.***
