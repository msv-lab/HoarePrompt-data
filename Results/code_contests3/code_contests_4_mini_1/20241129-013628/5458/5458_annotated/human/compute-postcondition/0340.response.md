Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on whether `j` is greater than `k`, and it is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
