Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is updated based on the conditions inside the loop depending on the values of `i`, `j`, and `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is updated based on the values from the previous states of the dp matrix.**
