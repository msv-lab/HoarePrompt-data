Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]]. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; otherwise, the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
