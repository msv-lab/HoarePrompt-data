Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented by 1 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
