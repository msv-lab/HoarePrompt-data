Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`**
