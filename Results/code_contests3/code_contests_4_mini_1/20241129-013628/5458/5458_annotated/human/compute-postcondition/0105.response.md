Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are positive integers; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; `i` is a non-negative integer. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1; if `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the variables. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
