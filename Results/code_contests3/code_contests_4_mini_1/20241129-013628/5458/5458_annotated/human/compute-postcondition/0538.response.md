The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
