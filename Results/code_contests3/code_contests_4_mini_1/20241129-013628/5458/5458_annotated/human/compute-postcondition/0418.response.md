According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer, `n ** 2` will also be a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, and after the current iteration, `i` will be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is `m`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions throughout all iterations of the loops, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`.**
