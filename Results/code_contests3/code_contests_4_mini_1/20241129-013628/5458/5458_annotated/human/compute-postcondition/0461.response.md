The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
