According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, where `s` is greater than or equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again for the next value of `k`.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. The current state of `n`, `m`, `s`, `j`, and `i` remains unchanged as they do not affect the loopâ€™s execution directly in this case.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `j` is `m + 1`, and `i` is 0.**
