The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. The previous values of the affected variables (`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`) are not explicitly provided, but we know that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now contain the sum of its previous value and the specified value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
