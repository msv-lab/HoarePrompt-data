The code snippet assigns the value `1` to the array `dp` at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `s + 2`, and `k` is `1`, we need to evaluate the indices used in the assignment.

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- The value of `j + 1` is `s + 3` since `j` is `s + 2`.
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the code sets `dp[1][s + 3][1]` to `1`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `s + 2`, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][s + 3][1]` is set to 1.**
