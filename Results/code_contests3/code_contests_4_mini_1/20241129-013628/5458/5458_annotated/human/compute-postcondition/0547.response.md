The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value stored in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is also not modified, as the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` holds the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` as previously stated, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` holds the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
