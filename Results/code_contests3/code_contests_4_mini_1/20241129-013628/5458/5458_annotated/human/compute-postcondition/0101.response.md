The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration in the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m` are positive integers; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 3; `i` is a non-negative integer; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
