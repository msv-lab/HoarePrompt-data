The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2; `k` is 2; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
