According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to `s + 2`, which exceeds the upper limit defined by `s + 1`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again without adjusting the state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 2`, for the loop to execute a next time `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1 which means `s` must be at least 1.**
