The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than 1; value assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
