The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
