Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, `k` is 1, `j` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
