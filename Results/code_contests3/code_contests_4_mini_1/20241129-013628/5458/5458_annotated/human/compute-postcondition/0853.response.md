According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which is initialized to 1 and will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 3, and it must be ensured that `k` is still within the bounds of `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, and `i` is 0; for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` which must be at least 3.**
