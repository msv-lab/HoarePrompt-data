According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `s + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. 

Since `m` is at least 2, and `j` is currently `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `s + 2` at the start of the next iteration. 

The value of `k` is equal to `s`, which remains unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Since `j` is currently `s + 1`, for the loop to continue executing, `m` must be at least `s + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is `s + 2`**
