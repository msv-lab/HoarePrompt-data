The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code, but the array `dp` is modified. 

Assuming `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` have defined values, the specific calculation depends on those values. However, without knowing the current state of the `dp` array, we cannot specify exact numerical values after the operation. 

Therefore, the Output State indicates that the operation modifies the `dp` array:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
