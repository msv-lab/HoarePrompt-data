The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous state indicates that `k` is 1 and `j` is at least 1, allowing for `k - j` to be evaluated. The impact of the code will specifically affect the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Since `k` is 1, `k - j` would need to be evaluated, but since `j` is at least 1, `k - j` would be 0 or negative. This situation may result in an index error or no applicable value for `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, depending on the array's bounds.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on potentially undefined behavior due to the index. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than 0, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which may result in an index error.**
