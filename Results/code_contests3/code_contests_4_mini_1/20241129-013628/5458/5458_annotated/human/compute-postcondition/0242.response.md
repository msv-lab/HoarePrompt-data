Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. `dp` reflects the combinations of selections based on all iterations from `1` to `m` and from `1` to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for all valid `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` is updated based on previous values, specifically `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be populated with combinations calculated from prior indices using modular arithmetic. The results will vary based on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k` throughout the iterations, ultimately capturing the cumulative combinations of selections.**
