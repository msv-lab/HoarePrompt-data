According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and since `s` is a positive integer, we need to check if `k` can be incremented.

Given that `k` is currently at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will need to be equal to 2 for the next iteration. Since `s` is a positive integer, it is also necessary that `k` does not exceed `s`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2 and less than or equal to `s`**
