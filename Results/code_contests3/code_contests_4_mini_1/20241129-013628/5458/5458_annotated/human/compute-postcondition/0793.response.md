Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer (at least 3), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
