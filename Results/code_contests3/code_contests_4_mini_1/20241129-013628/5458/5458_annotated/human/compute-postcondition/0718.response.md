The code snippet attempts to assign the value `1` to a multidimensional array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment as no values are modified; instead, it only changes the content of the `dp` array.

However, since `k` is defined as `s + 2`, it is understood that `k` is dependent on the value of `s`. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 2`, and we assign `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 2`, and we assign `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.**
