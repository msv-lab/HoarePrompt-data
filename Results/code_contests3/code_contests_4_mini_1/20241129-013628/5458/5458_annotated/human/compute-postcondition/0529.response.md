The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the `continue` statement indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[0][j][k]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
