Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s + 1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
