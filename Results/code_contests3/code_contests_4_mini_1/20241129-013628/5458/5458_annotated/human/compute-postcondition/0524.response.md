The code assigns the value `1` to the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `2`, the calculations for the indices will be as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which results in `3`.
- `k` remains `2`.

Thus, `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1.**
