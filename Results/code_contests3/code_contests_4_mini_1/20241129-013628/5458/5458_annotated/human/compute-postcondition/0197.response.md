Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change in the state of the program. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
