According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since `s` is a positive integer. At the start of the loop, the variable `k` will be set to 1 as it iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. 

The current state shows that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, but these variables are not directly involved in the loop execution. They may relate to other parts of the code, but they do not affect the execution of this specific loop.

Thus, the state needs no adjustments for the loop to execute, as `s` ensures the loop runs at least once, and `k` will correctly initialize to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is initialized as [[0, 0, ..., 0], [0, 0, ..., 0]] with length `s + 1` for each inner list, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
