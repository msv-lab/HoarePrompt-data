The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` indicates that we are updating the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` after taking it modulo `mod`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, and `s` is a positive integer, we assume that `i`, `j`, and `k` are indices related to the `dp` array, and the variables `mod`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` are defined and contain specific values.

The operation affects the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which sees an increment based on the current state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. The exact values depend on the previous state of `dp`, which is not specified here.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
