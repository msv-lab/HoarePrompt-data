Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
