Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers; `dp` is a 2D array where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, reflecting the combinations of selections based on `j` and `k`. The final values depend on the relationships defined in the loop for all iterations from `1` to `s`.**
