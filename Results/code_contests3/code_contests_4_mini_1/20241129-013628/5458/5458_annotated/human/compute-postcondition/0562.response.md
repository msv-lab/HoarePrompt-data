The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is 1, `k` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
