The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we are currently in. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `j` is at least 1 and less than or equal to `m`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
