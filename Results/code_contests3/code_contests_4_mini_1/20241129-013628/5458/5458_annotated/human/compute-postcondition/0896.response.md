According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop iterates for `j` starting from 1 up to `m`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` must become 3. Given that `m` is at least 2, `j` can still be less than or equal to `m`. 

Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are that `j` is 3 and `m` must be at least 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `dp[1][3][k]` is 1 for each `k` from 1 to `s`.**
