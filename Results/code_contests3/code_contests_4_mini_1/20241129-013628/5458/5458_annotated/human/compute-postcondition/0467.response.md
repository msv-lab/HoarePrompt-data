The statement assigns the value `1` to a specific index in a 3D array `dp`. The index is calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given that `i` is either `0` or `1`, `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` when `i` is `0` and to `0` when `i` is `1`. The value of `j + 1` is incremented by `1` from the current value of `j`. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `i` can be `0` or `1`
- `j` is at least `k`, and `j + 1` will be at least `k + 1`
- `k` is less than or equal to `s`

The output state reflects the assignment made to the `dp` array without changing the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, or `k` themselves.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
