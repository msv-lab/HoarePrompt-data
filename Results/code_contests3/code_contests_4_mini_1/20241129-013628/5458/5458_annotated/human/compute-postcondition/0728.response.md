According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute for the next iteration as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is less than `n ** 2`. 

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n ** 2`. 

If the current value of `i` is, for example, `k`, then the condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `k + 1` must be less than `n ** 2`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is a matrix with dimensions `[2][m + 1][s + 1]`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, and `i` will be `k + 1`.**
