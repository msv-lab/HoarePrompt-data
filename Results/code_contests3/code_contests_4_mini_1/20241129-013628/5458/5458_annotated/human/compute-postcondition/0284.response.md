The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the current value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `i`, and `j` are not provided, but we know that `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`. The other variables are unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
