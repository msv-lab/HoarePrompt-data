The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is a non-negative integer; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
