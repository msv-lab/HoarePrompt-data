Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, and `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is incremented and less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
