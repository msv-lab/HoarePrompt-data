Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `i` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, reflecting the updated combinations of selections.***
