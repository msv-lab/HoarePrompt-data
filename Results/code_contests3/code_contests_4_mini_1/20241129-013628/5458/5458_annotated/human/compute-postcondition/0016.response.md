The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` updates the value in the `dp` 2D array. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and the structure of `dp` are relevant here.

1. `i` is at least 1, so `i + 1` is at least 2.
2. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. Since `i` is at least 1, `i + 1` is even (at least 2), thus `i + 1 & 1` results in 0.
3. Therefore, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.
4. The value of `j` is greater than `k`, but since we do not have specific values, we cannot determine the exact state of the array.

The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment made to the `dp` array based on the current values of the indices.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, `i` is 0, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
