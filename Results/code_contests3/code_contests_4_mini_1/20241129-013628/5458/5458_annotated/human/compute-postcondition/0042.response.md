According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` starting from 1 up to and including `s`. At the end of the first iteration, the state of `k` will be `1`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be incremented to `2`. 

Additionally, the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` must remain positive integers, and `dp` must be a valid 2D array that can be accessed with the updated index.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time**
