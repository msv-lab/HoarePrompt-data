The value of the variables does not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` has been updated at dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] based on dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k], `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
