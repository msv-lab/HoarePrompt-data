Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `k` is 2, and `j` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, the execution continues in the most internal loop or statement. There is no else part in the code, hence no changes occur if the condition is false.***
