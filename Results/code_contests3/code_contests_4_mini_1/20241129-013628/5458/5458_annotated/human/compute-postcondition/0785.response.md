According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the range defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3, and the loop will continue executing as long as `s` is at least 3.

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, `k` will be 3. Since `s` is a positive integer and was at least 2 before, it needs to be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer (at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time), `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 3**
