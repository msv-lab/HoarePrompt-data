According to the code, the for loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`. The state at the end of the previous iteration indicates that `k` is currently 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Given that `s` is at least 2, the next value of `k` will be 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since the loop is set to execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the condition for the loop to execute again requires `s` to be at least 3 (which it is, since `s` is at least 2).

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `j` is `s + 2`.**
