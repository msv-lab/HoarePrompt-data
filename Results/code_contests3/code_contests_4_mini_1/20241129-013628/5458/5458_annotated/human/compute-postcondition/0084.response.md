Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is a positive integer, and `j` is reset to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration; otherwise, the execution of the if statement does not occur, and the program proceeds without any change to the variables.***
