According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to 1 (the first value in the range) since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `m + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 2. The variable `m` is at least 1, so for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is 2, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][s]` will be updated based on the loop conditions.**
