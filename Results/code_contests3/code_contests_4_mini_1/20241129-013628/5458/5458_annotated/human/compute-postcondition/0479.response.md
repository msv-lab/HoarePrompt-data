The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is incremented by 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.
