The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that we are assigning a value from one part of a multi-dimensional array `dp` to another. The operation involves indexing into `dp` using the values derived from `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (affects the loop execution),
- `m` is at least `s + 2`,
- `s` is at least 2,
- `k` is 2,
- `j` is `s + 2` for the loop to execute a second time.

The assignment does not affect the initial values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, or `j`, but it does utilize them for indexing. 

The specifics of `i` are not provided, but it is implied that it is part of a loop. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will result in either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `i`. The value of `j + 1` will be `s + 3`, assuming `j` is equal to `s + 2`.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged nature of the original variables while indicating the assignment operation performed on the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least `s + 2`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is `s + 2`, and the assignment operation on `dp` is executed.**
