The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. Instead, it processes multiple datasets of integers, specifically `N`, `M`, and `S`, where `N` is a positive integer constrained to 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is a positive integer constrained to 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and `S` is a positive integer constrained to 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. The input processing continues until all three values, `N`, `M`, and `S`, are zero, and the number of datasets processed does not exceed 5.

As for the output, the function's behavior or return value based on the datasets is not specified, so we cannot detail the exact output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets consisting of integers N, M, and S, stopping when all three values are zero. The function does not take any parameters directly.**
