According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition set by `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`, which means it has already exceeded `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be reset to 1, and `m` must remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is the final value of `s`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than or equal to `m`**
