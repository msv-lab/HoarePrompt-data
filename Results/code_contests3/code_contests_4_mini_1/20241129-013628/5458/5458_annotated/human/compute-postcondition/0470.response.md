The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 3, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is incremented by 1, `k` is unchanged and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
