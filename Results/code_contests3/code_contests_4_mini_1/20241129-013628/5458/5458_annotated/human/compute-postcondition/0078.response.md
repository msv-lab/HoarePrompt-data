The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the value of `dp` at the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0, so `i + 1` is 1. 
- `j` is reset to 1, so `j + 1` is 2. 
- `k` is 1, which remains unchanged.

The operation `i + 1 & 1` computes `1 & 1`, which equals `1` (bitwise AND). 

Thus, the assignment becomes:
```
dp[1][2][1] = 1
```

This indicates that the value at `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. The other variables `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged throughout this operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in the `dp` array specifically, while noting the other variable states remain as initially described.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1**.
