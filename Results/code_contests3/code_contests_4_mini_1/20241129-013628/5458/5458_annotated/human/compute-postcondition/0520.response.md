According to the code, the for loop is structured to iterate over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. The loop variable `j` is initialized to 1 during the first execution of the loop and will take values up to `m` during the iterations. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be incremented from its current value, which is `m + 1`, back to 2. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, the following adjustments must be made:
- `j` needs to be adjusted to 2, which is the value it will take for the second iteration.
- Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, it must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, according to the information provided.

Thus, the necessary states are:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is `s + 1`, and the `dp` array is updated based on the conditions met during all iterations of the loops, for the loop to execute a second time.**
