According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `n` is greater than 1 and `m` is at least 1, we do not need to adjust those values, but `k` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration.

Thus, after the current iteration where `k` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`.**
