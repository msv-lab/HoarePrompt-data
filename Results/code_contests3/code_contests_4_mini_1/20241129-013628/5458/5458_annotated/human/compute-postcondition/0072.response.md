Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are positive integers. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is incremented to 2 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to 0 but `j` is less than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is increased by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
