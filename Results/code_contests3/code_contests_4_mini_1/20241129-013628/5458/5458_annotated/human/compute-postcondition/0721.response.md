The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the initial state does not provide any information about a loop being present, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 2`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is `s + 2`, and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.**
