The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Since `n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers and `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute multiple times. The previous values of `dp` are not specified, but we know that the operation alters `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
