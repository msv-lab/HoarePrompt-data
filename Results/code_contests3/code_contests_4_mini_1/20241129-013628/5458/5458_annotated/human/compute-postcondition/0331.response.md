Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, and `i` is 0. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, then the program updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, which may lead to an index error.***
