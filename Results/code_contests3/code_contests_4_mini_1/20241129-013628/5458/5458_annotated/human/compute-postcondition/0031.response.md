According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `s` is at least 2, which allows the loop to execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1.

Since the loop starts with `k` equal to 1 and increments `k` by 1 in each iteration, in the next iteration `k` will be 3. The loop will then check if `k` is less than or equal to `s + 1`, which means that for it to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 2 (which is already satisfied).

Therefore, the values that need to be adjusted are `k` to 3, while `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `s` are positive integers, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a third time, `k` is 3**
