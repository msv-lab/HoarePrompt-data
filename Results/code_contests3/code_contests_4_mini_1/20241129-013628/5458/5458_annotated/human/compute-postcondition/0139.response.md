The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` are not explicitly given, but we know that `k` is 3 and `j` is a positive integer, which means `k - j` must be a non-negative integer as well. 

Thus, the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will depend on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`. This operation updates `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers; `s` is at least 3; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
