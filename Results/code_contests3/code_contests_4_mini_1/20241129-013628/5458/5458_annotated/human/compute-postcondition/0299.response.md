According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and its relationship with `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its current value, and we know that if the loop executes again, `k` would be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and since the current `k` is positive and will be incremented, the condition will still hold as long as `s` is at least 2.

State: **`n`, `m`, `s`, `i` are positive integers, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and `k` will be 2.**
