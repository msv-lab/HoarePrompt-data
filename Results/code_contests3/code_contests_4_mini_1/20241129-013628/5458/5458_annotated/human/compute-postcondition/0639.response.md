The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is used for this assignment, and the specific values of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` do not affect this operation. The state of all other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
