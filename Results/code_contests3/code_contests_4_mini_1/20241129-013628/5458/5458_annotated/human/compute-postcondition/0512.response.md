The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same, and we acknowledge that we skip to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
