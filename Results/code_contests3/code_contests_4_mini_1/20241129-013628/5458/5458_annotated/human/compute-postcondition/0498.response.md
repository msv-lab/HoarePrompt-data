Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][5][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, then `j` is updated to `j + 1`, `k` remains 1, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
