According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is a positive integer, meaning `k` can take values from 1 up to `s`. Since the loop is designed to iterate from 1 to `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if `k` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 4, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is 4, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
