According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for each value of `k` in the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Since `n`, `m`, and `dp` do not directly affect the loop execution, we focus on `s`. 

Given that `s` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, allowing `k` to take on the value of 1 during its first execution. Additionally, `j` being `m` does not impact the loop's execution.

In summary, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to affirm that `s` is indeed greater than 0, and that `k` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 1, `s` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
