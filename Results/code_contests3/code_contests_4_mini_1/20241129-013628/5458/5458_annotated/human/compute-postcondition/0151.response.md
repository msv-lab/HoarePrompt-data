The execution of the `continue` statement does not change the values of any of the variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least `s`, `k` is 1 for the first iteration, `j` is initialized to a value less than or equal to `m`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
