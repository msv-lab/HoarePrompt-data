Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are positive integers; `dp` reflects the combinations of selections based on all iterations from `1` to `m` and from `1` to `s`; `i` is a positive integer greater than 0; `j` is 1; and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the most internal loop or if statement is skipped.***
