The code snippet assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in the indexing for the `dp` array. The specific values of these variables are `i` (not equal to 0), `j` (which is 2), and `k` (which is 1).

The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is even or odd. The value of `j + 1` is 3. Since the state of the `dp` array is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine specific values, but we can state that the assignment has occurred.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of `j` and `k` are used for indexing, and the assignment operation has taken place.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is at least 2, `s` is a positive integer, `i` is not equal to 0, `k` is 1, `j` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
