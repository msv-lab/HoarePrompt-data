According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes to `s + 1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `j`, and `i` do not affect the execution of this loop directly. Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `s` must be at least 1, and `k` will be initialized to 1, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
