To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets all the requirements specified.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The Bingo card has N rows and N columns.
2. Each integer in the card is a positive integer between 1 and M.
3. The sum of all integers on the card equals S.
4. The integers in each column must be in ascending order from top to bottom.
5. The integer in each square must be larger than any integer in the column to its left.

### Code Analysis:
```python
mod = 100000
while 1:
    (n, m, s) = map(int, raw_input().split())
    if n == m == s == 0:
        break
    dp = [[[0] * (s + 1) for _ in xrange(m + 2)] for _ in xrange(2)]
    for i in xrange(n ** 2):
        for j in xrange(1, m + 1):
            for k in xrange(1, s + 1):
                if i == 0:
                    if j >= k:
                        dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1
                else:
                    if j > k:
                        dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]
                        continue
                    dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod
                    dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod
    print(dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod)
```

### Key Observations:
1. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to count the valid Bingo cards.
2. It initializes a 3D list `dp` to keep track of valid configurations.
3. It iterates over squares in the Bingo card (total `n^2`), considering possible values from 1 to M for each.
4. The conditions in the loops attempt to enforce the rules required by the Bingo card.
5. The checking conditions for the first row and subsequent rows seem to be implemented, but the logic for ensuring that the values are sorted and properly constrained is complex and not immediately clear.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program uses `xrange`, which is Python 2 syntax. The correct approach in Python 3 would be to use `range`.
2. The indexing logic and conditions seem convoluted, particularly around how it handles the dynamic programming update and the checks for the conditions of the Bingo card. 
3. There is no explicit handling in the code to ensure that the integers in each row are greater than the integers in the previous column, which is a critical requirement of the Bingo card.

### Edge Case:
- Given a small input, such as `N = 1, M = 1, S = 1`, we would expect a single valid Bingo card with the number 1. However, the logic may not handle the constraint checks correctly, particularly with the ranges and conditions used.

In conclusion, while the program attempts to implement a dynamic programming solution to count valid Bingo cards, it does not adequately ensure that all problem constraints are met, particularly the requirement that each square's value must be greater than the values in the preceding columns.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not consistently ensure that the integers in each square follow the strict ordering and uniqueness required by the Bingo card's rules.
