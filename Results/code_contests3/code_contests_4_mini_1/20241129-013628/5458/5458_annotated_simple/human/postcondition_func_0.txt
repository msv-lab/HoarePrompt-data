The function accepts multiple datasets where each dataset contains three positive integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 7), M (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000), and S (1 ≤ S ≤ 3000). It processes these datasets in a loop and computes a result based on dynamic programming principles until the dataset '0 0 0' is encountered. The computed result for each dataset is printed, specifically the value at `dp[N^2 & 1][M + 1][S] % 100000`. The function does not return any values but outputs results for each dataset processed.
