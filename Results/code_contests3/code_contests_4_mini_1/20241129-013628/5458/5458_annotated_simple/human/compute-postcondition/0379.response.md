Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]`, and the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, no changes occur in the state of the program.***
