The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the innermost loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `s` is at least 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions for all values of `j` and `k` for the loop to execute a second time, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the innermost loop.
