According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on the next value within the range defined by `1` to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has reached its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop is structured to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least `k + 1`. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, if `k` is currently `1`, then `s` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute a second time, and `k` must be updated to `2`.

State: **`n` is non-negative, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2.**
