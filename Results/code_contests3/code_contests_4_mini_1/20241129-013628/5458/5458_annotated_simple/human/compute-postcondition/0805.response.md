Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is less than `m`, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
