Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`; `k` is equal to `s`; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; if `i` is 0 and `j` (which is `s + 2`) is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is `N + 1`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
