According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j`. The loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `m`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Since `j` is currently `s + 1`, we need to ensure that `s + 1` is less than or equal to `m`.

Given that `s` is a positive integer, `s + 1` can be at least 2. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `s + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`. This means that `j` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration, making `j` equal to `s + 2`.

So, the new value of `j` will be `s + 2`, and for the loop to execute again, we must ensure that `s + 2` is still less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, and `j` is `s + 2`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
