The command `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, `j` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
