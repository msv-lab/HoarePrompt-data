The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is not specified, but it is known that `n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. 

Since the specific values are not provided, we cannot directly compute the exact value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but we can establish that it will depend on the modulus operation applied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

The output state summarizing the impact is that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`**
