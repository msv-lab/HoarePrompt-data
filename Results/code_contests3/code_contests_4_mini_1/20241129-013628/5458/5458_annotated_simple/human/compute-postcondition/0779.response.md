The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`. The values of `j` and `k` are given as integers, with `j` being at least 3 and `k` being 4. The previous values of the affected variables are not stated, but they are part of the indexing of the `dp` array.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
