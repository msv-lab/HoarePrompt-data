According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. This implies that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `k` is currently 2, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which means `s` must be at least 3 (since `k` will be 3 in the next iteration). 

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `k` will become 3,
- `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
