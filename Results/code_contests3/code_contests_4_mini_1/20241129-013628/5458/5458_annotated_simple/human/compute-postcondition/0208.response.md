Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is equal to the final value of `s`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and the `dp` array has been updated based on all the iterations of the nested loops, with values depending on the conditions inside the loops.**
