Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least `3`; `j` is `3`; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is `s + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.***
