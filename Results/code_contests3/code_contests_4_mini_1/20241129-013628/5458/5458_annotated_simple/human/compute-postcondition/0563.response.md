Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s`, and if `j` is greater than `k`, the next iteration of the loop is executed without further modifications to `m`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `s`, or `k`.***
