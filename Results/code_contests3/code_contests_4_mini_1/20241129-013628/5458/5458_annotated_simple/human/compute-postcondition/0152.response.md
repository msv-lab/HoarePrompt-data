Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 2, and the dp array has been updated based on the iterations. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Otherwise, there are no updates made to the dp array.***
