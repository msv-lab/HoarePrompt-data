According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relation to `s`. The loop iterates with `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1` because the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be set to 2 (the next value after 1). 

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` should be incremented to the next value, which is 2.
- `s` remains at least 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is equal to `n`.**
