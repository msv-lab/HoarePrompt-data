Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 4. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
