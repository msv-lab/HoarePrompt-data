The code `continue` does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of the nearest loop. The current context implies that we are within a loop, and thus the execution will proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, `j` is reset to 1, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**
