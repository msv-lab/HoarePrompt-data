According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take on the value of 3, since it starts from 1 and goes up to `s` (which is at least 2). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 3`; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time.**
