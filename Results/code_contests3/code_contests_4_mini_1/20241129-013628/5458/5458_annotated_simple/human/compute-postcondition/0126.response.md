The code snippet involves an assignment operation using a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The specific assignment copies the value from one element in the array to another.

The affected variables include `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` ensures that the result will toggle between two states based on whether `i` is even or odd. The values of `j` and `k` remain unchanged as they are only referenced in the assignment.

Since the previous values of `dp` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements being assigned or copied. However, we know that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will take the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Therefore, the Output State reflects the operation without specifying exact numerical values:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
