Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, if `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `n` and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.***
