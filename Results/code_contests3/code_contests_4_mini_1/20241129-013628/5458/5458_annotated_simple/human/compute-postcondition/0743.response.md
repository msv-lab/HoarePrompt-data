According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from `k = 1` to `s`, so it can execute as long as `s` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented to 2. Therefore, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is non-negative, if `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2.**
