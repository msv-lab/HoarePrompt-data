The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value from one position in the `dp` array to another. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `0` or `1` since it is a bitwise AND operation, effectively determining the parity of `i + 1`. 

This operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, or `s`, but it will affect the `dp` array based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The variable `k` is always `2`, so it does not affect the assignment.

Since `j` can either be greater than or equal to `1` or equal to `2`, the second dimension of the `dp` array will depend on the specific value of `j`. 

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k`, but we note the assignment operation occurring in the `dp` array based on the values of `i` and `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k].**
