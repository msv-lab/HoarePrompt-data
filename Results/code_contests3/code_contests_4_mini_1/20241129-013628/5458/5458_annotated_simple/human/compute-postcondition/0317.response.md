According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is equal to `N` and `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` will also be a positive integer within this range. The loop iterates `n ** 2` times, and since `n` is at least 1, `n ** 2` will also be at least 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and can iterate up to `n ** 2 - 1`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
