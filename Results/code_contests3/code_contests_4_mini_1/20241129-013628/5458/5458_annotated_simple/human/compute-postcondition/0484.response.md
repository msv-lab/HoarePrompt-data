Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least `3`; `j` is `3`; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`. Depending on the values of `i` and `j`, the `dp` array will be updated accordingly based on the conditions evaluated within the loop.**
