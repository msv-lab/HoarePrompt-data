The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves an assignment to a multi-dimensional array `dp`. The indices of `dp` are calculated as follows:

- `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. The expression `1 & 1` results in `1`, so the first index is `1`.
- `j + 1`: Given that `j` is 2, `j + 1` is `3`, so the second index is `3`.
- `k`: Since `k` is 1, the third index is `1`.

This means the value `1` is assigned to `dp[1][3][1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.**
