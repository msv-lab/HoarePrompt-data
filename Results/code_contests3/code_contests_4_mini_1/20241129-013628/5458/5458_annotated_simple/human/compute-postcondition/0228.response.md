The command `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead skips the current iteration of the loop, moving on to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that there has been no change in the variables due to this command.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
