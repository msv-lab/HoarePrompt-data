Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is equal to `s + 2` (where `s` is at least `N`); `k` is equal to `s + 1` (which is at least 2). If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
