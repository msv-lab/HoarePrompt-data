The `continue` statement affects the flow of control within a loop, causing the loop to skip the remaining code within its body for the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the values of the variables do not change due to this statement and the context of the loop is not provided, we can only affirm that the loop continues to the next iteration without any modifications to the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0; `j + 1` is 5, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
