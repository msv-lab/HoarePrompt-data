The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s` (which is at least 1), and `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
