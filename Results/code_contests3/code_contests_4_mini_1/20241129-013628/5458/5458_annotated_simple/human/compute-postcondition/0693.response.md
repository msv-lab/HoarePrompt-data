Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions involving `i`, `j`, and `k`, with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, and `j` incremented accordingly. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, the final values in `dp` depend on the cumulative updates from previous iterations along with the modulus operation. `m` remains greater than or equal to 1, `j` is at least 2 or equal to `s + 1`, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
