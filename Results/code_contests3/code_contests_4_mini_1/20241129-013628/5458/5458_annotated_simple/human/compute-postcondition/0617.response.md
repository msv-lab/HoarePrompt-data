Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 3`; `k` is 3; `s` is at least 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the specific element of the `dp` array is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.***
