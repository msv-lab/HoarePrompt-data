Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `i` is equal to `N^2`; `dp` contains the computed values based on the conditions applied throughout all iterations; the result printed is `dp[N^2 & 1][M + 1][S] % mod`.**
