According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` takes values from 1 to `s`. To execute the loop at least once, `s` must be at least 1. Since `i` is set to 1, it indicates that the loop has already executed once, so we need to adjust `k` to reflect that it would be executing for the second time, which means `k` should be 2 after the first iteration. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 (since `k` starts from 1), and `k` must now be 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2**
