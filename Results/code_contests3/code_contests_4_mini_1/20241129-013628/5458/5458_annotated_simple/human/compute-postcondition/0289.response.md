Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and less than or equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
