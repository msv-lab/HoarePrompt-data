Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, and the `dp` array contains updated values based on the nested loops' conditions, including potential values set to 1 for applicable indices and accumulated values based on previous states of the `dp` array.**
