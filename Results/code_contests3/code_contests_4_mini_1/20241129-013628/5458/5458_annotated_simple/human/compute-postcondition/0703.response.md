The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
