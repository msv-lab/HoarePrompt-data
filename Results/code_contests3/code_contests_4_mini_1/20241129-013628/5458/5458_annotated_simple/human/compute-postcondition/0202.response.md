The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 3 and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
