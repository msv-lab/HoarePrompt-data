The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous state of the affected variables shows that `i` is greater than 0, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. The exact values of the `dp` array elements depend on the specific indices used, but we can denote the operation that modifies `dp` based on the existing values.

The output state reflects that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Other variable states remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, `k` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
