Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
