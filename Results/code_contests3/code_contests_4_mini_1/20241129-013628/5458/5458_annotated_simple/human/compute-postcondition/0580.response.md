The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, which means that we skip the rest of the current loop iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 2`; `k` is at least 4; `s` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
