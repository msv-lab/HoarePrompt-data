The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, which means the current iteration ends here. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than `k`, and `k` is currently at `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is assigned the value of dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
