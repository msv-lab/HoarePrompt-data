Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, and `j` is now `j + 1`. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
