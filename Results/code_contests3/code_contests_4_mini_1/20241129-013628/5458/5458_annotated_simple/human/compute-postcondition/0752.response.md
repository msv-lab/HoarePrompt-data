According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3**
