The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies a multi-dimensional array `dp`. 

- The expression `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1 because it will add 1 to `i` (which is 0) and then apply a bitwise AND with 1. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.
- The expression `j + 1` results in `3` since `j` is `2`. 

Therefore, the code modifies `dp[1][3][k]` where `k` is `2`.

We do not have the initial state of the `dp` array, but we can safely assume that the operation assigns the value `1` to `dp[1][3][2]`. 

Since the other variables (`N`, `n`, `s`, and `k`) are not directly modified by this assignment, they remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1.**
