The execution of the `continue` statement causes the current iteration of the loop to end prematurely, and the control is transferred to the next iteration of the loop. The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is either 1 or greater than 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than `k`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 1 or greater than 0; `j` is 2; `k` is 1; `j` is greater than `k`; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
