Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, `j` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, and the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`.**
