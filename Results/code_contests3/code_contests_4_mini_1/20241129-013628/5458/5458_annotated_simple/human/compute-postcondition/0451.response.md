Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is equal to `s`; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for at least one value of `k`; otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` for all iterations.**
