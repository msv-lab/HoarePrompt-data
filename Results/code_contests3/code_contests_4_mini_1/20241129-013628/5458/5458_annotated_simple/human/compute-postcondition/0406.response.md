Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the loop will skip to the next iteration without making any modifications.***
