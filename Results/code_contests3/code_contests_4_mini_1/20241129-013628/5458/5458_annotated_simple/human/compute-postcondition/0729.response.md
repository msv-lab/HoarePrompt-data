According to the code, whether the loop can execute a second time depends on the variables `j`, `m`, and the current value of `i`. To execute the loop a second time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Before the loop starts, `n` is non-negative, and `i` can be either 1 or greater than 0, but we need to ensure that `j` can start at 1 and determine the state of `j` after the first iteration.

Given that `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to execute a second time, `j` must be 2 on the second execution, which means `m` must be at least 2. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `m` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 1 or greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, `j` is 2**
