The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. 

1. The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is affected by the addition operation.
2. The previous values of the affected variables are:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `k` is equal to `s`, which is at least `N`.
3. The value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is accessed, where `k - j` is at least `s - 3`.

Since we don't have explicit values for `dp` or `mod`, we cannot determine specific numerical outputs; we only know the operation performed on `dp`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**.
