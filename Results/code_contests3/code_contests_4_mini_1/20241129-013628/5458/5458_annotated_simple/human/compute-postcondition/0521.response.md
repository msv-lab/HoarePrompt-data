According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `s` is at least 1, since the range of `k` goes from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is at least `N` and `N` is a positive integer, the loop can execute if `s` is at least 1 (which it is, since `s` is at least `N` and `N` is at least 1). 

Before the loop starts, `k` is not defined yet, as it will be assigned the value of 1 at the start of the loop. The variable `i` can be either 2 or 1, but this does not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Therefore, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are that `s` is at least 1 and `k` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is 2 or 1, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time since `s` is at least 1**
