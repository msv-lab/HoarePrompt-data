The code assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The variables affected here are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

- `i` is 0, hence `i + 1 & 1` results in `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` results in `3`.
- The value of `k` remains `2`.

Therefore, the expression `dp[1][3][2]` will be assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2] % mod`.

Since the output state does not specify the value of `mod` or the elements of the `dp` array, we can only describe the assignment without specific values involved. Consequently, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2] % mod`.**
