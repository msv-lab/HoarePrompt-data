The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is at least 2; `k` is equal to 2; `m` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is equal to `n` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
