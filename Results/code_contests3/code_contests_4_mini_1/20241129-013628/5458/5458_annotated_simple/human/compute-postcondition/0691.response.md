The operation `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the result of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The current value of `k` is `s + 1`, and since for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than `k`, we infer that `k` is greater than `s`, hence `k - j` must be valid for the operation. Other variables such as `n`, `s`, and `j` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative; `s` must be greater than `k`; `k` is at `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
