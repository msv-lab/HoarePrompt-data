The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values from the input, which are read as integers. The previous value of `n` is equal to `N`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to 7. The variables `m` and `s` can take any positive integer values, constrained by their specified ranges (1 to 2000 for `m` and 1 to 3000 for `s`). Therefore, after the execution of the code, `n`, `m`, and `s` will hold new values based on the input provided.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000**
