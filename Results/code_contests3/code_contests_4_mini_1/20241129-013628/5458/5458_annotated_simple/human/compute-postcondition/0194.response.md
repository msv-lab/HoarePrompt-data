Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes are made in the state of the program.***
