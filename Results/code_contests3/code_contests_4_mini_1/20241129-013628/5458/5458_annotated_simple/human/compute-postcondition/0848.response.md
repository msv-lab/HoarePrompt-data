The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of `n`, `k`, `s`, and `dp` are not changed by this statement. The loop will check its conditions again for the next iteration, and since `k` is 2, it implies that the loop can execute a second time.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative; `k` is 2; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
