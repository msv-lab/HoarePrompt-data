Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 4, `j` is at least 4, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than `k`, then we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the behavior regarding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unspecified.***
