Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, and `i` is equal to 0; if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
