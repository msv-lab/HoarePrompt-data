According to the code, the loop iterates based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 0, and since `n` is non-negative, `n ** 2` is also non-negative. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, meaning that `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1` and `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 1 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions for all values of `j` and `k`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`, specifically `i` must be less than `n ** 2` and equal to 1.**
