According to the provided code, the loop will execute based on the value of `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Given the states:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7,
- `n` is equal to `N`,
- `s` is equal to the final value of `s`,
- `k` is equal to `s`,
- `m` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `i` is equal to `n`,
- `j` is equal to `s + 2`.

Since `s` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `k` is equal to `s`, if `s` is at least 1, the loop is set to execute with `k` also being at least 1. 

In conclusion, for the loop to execute:
- `s` must be at least 1,
- `k` will be equal to `s`,
- The loop starts with `k` at 1.

Thus, the state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `s + 2, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1**
