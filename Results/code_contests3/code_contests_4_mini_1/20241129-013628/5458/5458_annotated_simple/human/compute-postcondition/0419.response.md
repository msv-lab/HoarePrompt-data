According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The `xrange` function generates numbers from 1 to `m` inclusive, so for the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. Given the current state where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7 and `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is currently 1, and to execute a second time, `j` must be 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
