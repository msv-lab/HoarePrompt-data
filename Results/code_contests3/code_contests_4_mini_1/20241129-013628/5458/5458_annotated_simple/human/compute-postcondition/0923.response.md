The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `j` is at least `k + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
