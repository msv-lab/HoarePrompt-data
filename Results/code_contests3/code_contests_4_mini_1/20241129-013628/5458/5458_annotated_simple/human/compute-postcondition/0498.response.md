Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 4, `j` is at least 4, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on previous values, while other variables remain unchanged.***
