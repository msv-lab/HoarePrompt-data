The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` suggests that we are working with a 3-dimensional list (or array) `dp`. The indices being accessed are calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7
- `n` is equal to `N`
- `m` is at least 8
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 1
- `s` is at least `N`
- `k` is 1
- `j` is greater than or equal to `k`

Let's analyze the indices:
- `i + 1 & 1`: Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1. The bitwise AND operation `1 & 1` results in 1.
- `j + 1`: Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2.
- `k` is 1.

The specific assignment is to set `dp[1][2][1] = 1`.

Now, we note that this operation modifies the `dp` array at the specified indices, but the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` themselves remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1; and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1; and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.**
