Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `j` is at least `k + 1`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment to `dp` does not occur as the loop does not execute a second time. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. The operation on `dp` does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `k`, or `j`, but modifies the `dp` array based on its previous values and the modulo operation.***
