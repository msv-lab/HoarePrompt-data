The `continue` statement does not alter the values of any variables but instead skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop that contains it, continuing with the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that the previous variable values remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and no further changes occur due to the constraint on `k`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**
