According to the code, the loop executes as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 3, and the loop variable `k` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 4 (since `k` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 2`; `k` is at least 4, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 4.**
