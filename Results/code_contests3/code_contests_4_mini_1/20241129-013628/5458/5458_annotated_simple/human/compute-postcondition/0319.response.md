According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s`. The current state indicates that `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, which do not impact the execution of this specific loop. The values of `N` and `n` are also not directly relevant to whether the loop executes, as they are not involved in the loop condition.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `s` must be at least 1. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, k is 1**
