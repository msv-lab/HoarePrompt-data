The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is equal to 1, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp[0][4][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
