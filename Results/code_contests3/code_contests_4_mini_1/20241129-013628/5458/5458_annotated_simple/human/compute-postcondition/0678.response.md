Output State: **`n` is non-negative, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
