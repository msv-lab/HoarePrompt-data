According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, and the loop has reached its maximum value. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, which makes `k` equal to `s + 1`. However, since `k` must remain within the range from 1 to `s`, the loop cannot execute again unless `s` is increased. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be increased to at least `s + 1`, and `k` will be `s + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is equal to `n` for the loop to execute one more time.**
