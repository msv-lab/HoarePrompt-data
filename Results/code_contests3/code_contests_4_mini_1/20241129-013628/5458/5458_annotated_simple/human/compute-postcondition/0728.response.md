According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, and `n` is non-negative. Since `i` must be less than `n ** 2` for the loop to execute again, we need to consider the next value of `i` after the current iteration.

If `i` is currently 0, it will increment to 1 for the next iteration. If `i` is greater than 0, it will increment by 1 as well. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2` after the increment.

Thus, if `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0 (since `0 < n ** 2` when `n` is greater than 0). If `i` is greater than 0, we can represent the next state as `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least `sqrt(i + 1)`.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 1 or greater than 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be such that `i` is less than `n ** 2`.**
