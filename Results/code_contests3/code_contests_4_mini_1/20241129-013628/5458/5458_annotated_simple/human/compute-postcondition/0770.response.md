The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves an assignment to a multidimensional list or array `dp`. The index `i + 1 & 1` calculates the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`, which will yield either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The index `j + 1` is simply incrementing `j` by `1`, while `k` remains unchanged at `3`. 

Given that `i` is greater than `0`, we know that `i + 1` is at least `2`, which means `i + 1 & 1` will yield `0` if `i` is even and `1` if `i` is odd. The value of `j` plus `1` will be at least `j + 1`, where `j` is greater than `k` (which is `3`).

Therefore, the assignment updates the value of `dp` at the specified indices. The values of `n`, `s`, and the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**.
