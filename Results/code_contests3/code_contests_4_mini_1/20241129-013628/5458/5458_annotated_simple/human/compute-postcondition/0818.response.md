According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 3. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `s` must still be at least 3. 

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, `k` is 3; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3**
