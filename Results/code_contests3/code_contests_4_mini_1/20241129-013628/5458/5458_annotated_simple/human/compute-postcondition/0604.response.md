The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration in the loop it resides in and continues with the next iteration, if there is one. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 3`; `k` is equal to 2; `s` is at least 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
