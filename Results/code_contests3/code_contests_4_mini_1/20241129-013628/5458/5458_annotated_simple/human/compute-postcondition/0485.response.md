According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `m` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 4; `j` is 4; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`**
