Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the addition from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, but this access may lead to potential issues since `j` is greater than `k`.***
