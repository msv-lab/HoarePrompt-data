The code assigns the value `1` to the 3D array `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given that `i` is `0`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (which is `1`), and `k` is also `1`, we can calculate the indices for `dp`.

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` is at least `2` (since `j` is at least `1`).
- `k` is `1`.

Thus, the assignment `dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1` will set the element of `dp` at that specific index to `1`, while the other variables' states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.**
