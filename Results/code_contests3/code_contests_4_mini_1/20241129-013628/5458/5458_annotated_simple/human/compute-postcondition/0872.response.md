The `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, and the execution context moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the initial state, but we note that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` has been updated according to the conditions based on the range of `j` and `k`, `j` is greater than `k`, and `m` is at least 2; we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
