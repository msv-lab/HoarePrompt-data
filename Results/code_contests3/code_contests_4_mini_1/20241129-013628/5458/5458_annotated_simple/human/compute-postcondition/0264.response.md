Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
