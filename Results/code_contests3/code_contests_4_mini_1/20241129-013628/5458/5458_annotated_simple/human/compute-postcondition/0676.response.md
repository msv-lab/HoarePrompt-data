The code snippet sets `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. Given the initial state, we know `i` is non-negative, and if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, the code involves an update to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on previous values, but here it directly assigns `1` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Since the expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the next state based on current `i`, the results are dependent on the parity of `i`. The variable `j` indicates the next index based on its current value. The variable `k` is also assumed to have a defined state.

Therefore, the output state reflects these calculations. Since the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not given, we state the general outcomes.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1**
