Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated at either `dp[1][2][2]` or `dp[0][2][2]` based on the value of `i`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][2]` has been updated by adding `dp[i & 1][1][1] % mod`.***
