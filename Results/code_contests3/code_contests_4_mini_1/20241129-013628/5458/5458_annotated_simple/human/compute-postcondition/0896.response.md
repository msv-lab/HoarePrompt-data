According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from 1 up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least as large as `k` and `k` is equal to `s`, which is at least 3. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was at least `k`, it must now be incremented to at least `k + 1`. Hence, `j` will now be equal to `k + 1`. 

For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `j`. Since `j` is now `k + 1`, and `k` is equal to `s`, we have that for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than `s + 1`. 

State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is at least `k + 1`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for the final values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `s + 1**
