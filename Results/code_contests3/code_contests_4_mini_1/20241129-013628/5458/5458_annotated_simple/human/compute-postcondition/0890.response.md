The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
