The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 5, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 5, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 5, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 5, and we skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop.**
