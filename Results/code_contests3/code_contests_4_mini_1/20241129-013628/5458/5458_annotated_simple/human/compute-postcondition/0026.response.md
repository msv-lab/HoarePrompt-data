The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since we have no specific loop context provided in the initial state, we can conclude that the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, we still have `N` as a positive integer (1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7), `n` equal to `N`, `k` as 2, and the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is still set based on the previous states of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` without any specific change in values due to the `continue`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `k` is 2; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
