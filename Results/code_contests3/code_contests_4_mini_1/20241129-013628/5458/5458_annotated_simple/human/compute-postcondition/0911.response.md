The code attempts to assign a value of `1` to the variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. However, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means that `k` cannot be less than or equal to `s`. Therefore, the loop is not executed a second time, and no changes are made to the existing variable states.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is at least `k + 1`, and the assignment to `dp` does not occur as the loop does not execute a second time.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is at least `k + 1`, and the assignment to `dp` does not occur as the loop does not execute a second time.**
