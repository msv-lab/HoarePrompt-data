Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod`.***
