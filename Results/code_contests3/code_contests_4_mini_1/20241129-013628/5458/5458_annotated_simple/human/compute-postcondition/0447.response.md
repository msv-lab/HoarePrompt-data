Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp` is updated based on current indices, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
