Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is equal to the final value of `s`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is equal to `s + 2`. If `s` is greater than 0, then `dp` is updated based on the conditions in the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`. If `s` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `dp` remains unchanged.**
