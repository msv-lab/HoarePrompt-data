Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s` (which is at least 1), and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
