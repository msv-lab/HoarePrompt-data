According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `i` and the upper limit determined by `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is equal to `N`, where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 7. Therefore, the maximum value of `n ** 2` is `49` (when `N` is 7), and the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`.

Since `i` is either 0 or 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1 or 2 respectively. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`.

So, the updated states should reflect that `i` is now 2 if it was 1, or remain at 1 if it was 0. Additionally, `n` remains equal to `N`, and `N` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than `i`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is 2 or 1; `j` is equal to `m`; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions.**
