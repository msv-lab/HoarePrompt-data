The operation `continue` does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the loop will skip the current iteration and move on to the next one. Therefore, the output state reflects that there is no change in the variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; the loop continues to the next iteration.**
