The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j` is less than `m`, `k` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
