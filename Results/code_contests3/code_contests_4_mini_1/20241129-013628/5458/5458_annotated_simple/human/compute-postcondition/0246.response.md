Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is `s + 2`, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m.`***
