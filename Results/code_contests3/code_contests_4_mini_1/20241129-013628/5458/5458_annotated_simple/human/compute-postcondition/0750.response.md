The code snippet updates the `dp` array based on the indices derived from the variables `i`, `j`, and `k`. The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` indicates that the value of `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1]` (which is `1` if `i` is `0` and `0` if `i` is `1`) is being incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variable `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `2`, therefore `k - j` is `0`.

The specific values will be:
- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1` because `i` is `0`.
- `j + 1` is `3`.
- `k - j` is `0`, so we look at `dp[0][2][0]`.

Thus, the operation becomes:
```
dp[1][3][2] += dp[0][2][0] % mod
```

This means we are adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod` to `dp[1][3][2]`. The values of `n`, `s`, `mod` are not directly modified, and we assume `dp` exists with valid indices.

The output state will reflect the updated value in the `dp` array based on this operation, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2; `dp[1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[0][2][0] % mod` to its previous value.**
