According to the code, the loop is structured to run for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `s` is at least 3, meaning `s + 1` is at least 4, which allows for multiple iterations of the loop.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means that the loop has completed its iterations. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be reset to 1 for the next iteration, and the loop will run as long as it is within the range specified. 

Since the loop will not execute again based on the current state (as `k` must be less than or equal to `s + 1`), we need to adjust the state by resetting `k` to its starting value of 1.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `j` is at least `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.**
