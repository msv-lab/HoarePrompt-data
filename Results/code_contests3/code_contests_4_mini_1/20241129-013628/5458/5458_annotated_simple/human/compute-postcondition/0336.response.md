The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
