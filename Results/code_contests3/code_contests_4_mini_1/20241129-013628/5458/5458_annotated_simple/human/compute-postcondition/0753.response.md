The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array. Here, `i` is `0`, `j` is `2`, and `k` is `3`. 

Calculating the indices:
- For `i + 1 & 1`: `0 + 1 & 1` equals `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- For `j + 1`: `2 + 1` equals `3`.
- The value of `k` remains `3`.

So, the element `dp[1][3][3]` is set to `1`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `j`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation, so they remain the same. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.**
