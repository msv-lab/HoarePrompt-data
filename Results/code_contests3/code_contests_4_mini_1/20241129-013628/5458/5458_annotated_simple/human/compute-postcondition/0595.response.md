The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is at least `N + 3`, `k` is equal to 1, `s` is at least 1, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
