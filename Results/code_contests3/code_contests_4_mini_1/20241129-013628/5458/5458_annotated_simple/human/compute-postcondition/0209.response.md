According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n ** 2`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which is equal to `N` (where 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7). 

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time until it reaches `n ** 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n ** 2`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1.

If `n` is equal to `N`, then `n ** 2` can be calculated as `N ** 2`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `N` and `N` must be less than `N ** 2`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N`, so we increment `i` to `N + 1`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is equal to the final value of `s`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is equal to `m + 1`, and the `dp` array has been updated based on all the iterations of the nested loops, with values depending on the conditions inside the loops.**
