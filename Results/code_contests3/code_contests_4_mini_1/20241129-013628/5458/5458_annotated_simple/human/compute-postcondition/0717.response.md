According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the limit `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will increment by 1, so `k` will become 4. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4.**
