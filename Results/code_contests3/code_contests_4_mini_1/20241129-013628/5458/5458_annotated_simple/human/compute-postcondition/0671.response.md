Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, `k` is 1, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
