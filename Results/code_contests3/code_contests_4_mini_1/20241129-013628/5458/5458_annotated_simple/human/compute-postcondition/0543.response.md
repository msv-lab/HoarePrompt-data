According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must increase by 1, which will make `k` equal to 3. Since `s` is at least 2, the loop will not be able to execute again if `k` exceeds `s`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 3. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
