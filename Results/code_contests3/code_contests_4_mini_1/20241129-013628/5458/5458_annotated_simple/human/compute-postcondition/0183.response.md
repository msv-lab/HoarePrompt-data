Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
