The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves assigning the value `1` to a specific location in a multidimensional array `dp`. The indices of this array are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. `i` is 0, so `i + 1` becomes `1`. The expression `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, which implies that the first index of `dp` is `1`.
2. `j` is an integer greater than or equal to `3`, thus `j + 1` will be at least `4`.
3. `k` is `1`, remaining unchanged in this operation.

This means the assignment targets `dp[1][j + 1][1]`, where `j + 1` is at least `4`. The value `1` is now stored at that specific location in the `dp` array.

The other variables `n`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to the `dp` array and the current values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, `k` is 1, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is now 1**.
