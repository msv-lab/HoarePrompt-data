According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop runs for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 3. Since `s` is greater than or equal to 2, it allows the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute a third time.**
