According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j`. The loop starts with `j` at 1 and continues until it is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is some integer value that is currently less than or equal to `m`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. 

Since `j` is currently greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure that the new value of `j` (which will be `j + 1`) is still less than or equal to `m` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than `m`, and the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.**
