Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `i` is equal to `N^2`; `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions; and the output is `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`.**
