Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3] % mod`, and `dp[1][3][3]` is updated based on `dp[0][2][1] % mod`.***
