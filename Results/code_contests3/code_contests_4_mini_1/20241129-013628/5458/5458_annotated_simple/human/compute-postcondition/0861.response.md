Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 while `n` and `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
