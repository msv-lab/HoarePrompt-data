The code `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` modifies the `dp` array at the position calculated by the indices. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the value of `i + 1` and then applies a bitwise AND operation with 1, which will result in either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. The variable `j` is incremented by 1, and since `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `j + 1` will be at least 4. The variable `k` remains unchanged at 4.

Based on these observations, the output state is:
- The value for the first index of `dp` is determined by whether `i + 1` is even or odd, resulting in `0` or `1`.
- The second index is `j + 1`, which is at least `4`.
- The third index is `k`, which is `4`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to `1`.**
