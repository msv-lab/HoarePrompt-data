Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the assignment to `dp` occurs without changing these values, resulting in an update to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` using values from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.**
