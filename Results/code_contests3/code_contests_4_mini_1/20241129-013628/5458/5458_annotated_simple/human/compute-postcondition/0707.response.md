Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][3][-1] % mod`.***
