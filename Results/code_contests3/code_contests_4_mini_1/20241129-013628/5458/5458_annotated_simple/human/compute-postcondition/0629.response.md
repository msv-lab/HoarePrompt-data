According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The current state indicates that `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute, we also need to ensure that `s` is at least 1. The variable `k` will start at 1 when the loop is executed.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1**
