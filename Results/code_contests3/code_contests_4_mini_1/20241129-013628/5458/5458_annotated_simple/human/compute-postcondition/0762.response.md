According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `m + 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` will be incremented to 3. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 3 (since the range is from 1 to `m + 1`, and we need `j` to be less than or equal to `m`).

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `m` must be at least 3.**
