Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least `N`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the execution continues to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Since `k` is equal to `s`, the condition `j > k` cannot be met, and therefore the loop will not execute again.***
