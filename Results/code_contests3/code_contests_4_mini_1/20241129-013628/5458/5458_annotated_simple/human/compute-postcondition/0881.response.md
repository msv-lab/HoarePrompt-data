The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and start the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
