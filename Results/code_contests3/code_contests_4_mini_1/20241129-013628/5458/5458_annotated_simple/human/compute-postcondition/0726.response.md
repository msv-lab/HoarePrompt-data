Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least `s` (where `s` is the final value after the loop completes), and `k` is `s`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1 for each `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous values accordingly.**
