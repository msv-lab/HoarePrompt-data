Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made in the state of the program.***
