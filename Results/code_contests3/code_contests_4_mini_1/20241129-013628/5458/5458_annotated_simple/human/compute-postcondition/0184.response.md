The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the program skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `s + 2`, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
