The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The initial state mentions that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, indicating a previous operation, but now we focus on this new assignment.

The specific value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` is not provided, but it is affected by the indices `i`, `j`, and `k`. The value of `k` is at least `k + 1`, which means `k - j` is valid since `j` is at least `k + 1`. 

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous state of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 1, `j` is at least `k + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
