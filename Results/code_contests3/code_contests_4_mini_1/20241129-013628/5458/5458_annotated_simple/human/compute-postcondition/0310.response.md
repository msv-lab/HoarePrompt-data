Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `dp` is updated based on the nested loop calculations for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, with specific values set according to the conditions inside the loops.**
