According to the code, the loop is a `while True`, which means it will always execute again regardless of the current program state. Therefore, there is no need to make any adjustments to the state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `i` is equal to `N^2`; `dp` is updated based on the loop conditions; and the output is `dp[n`**
