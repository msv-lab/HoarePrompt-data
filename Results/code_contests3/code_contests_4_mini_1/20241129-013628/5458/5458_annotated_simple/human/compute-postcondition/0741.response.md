The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given: `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. Therefore, `k - j` results in `1 - 2`, which equals `-1`. Since `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` would access an out-of-bounds index, we cannot determine its value.

Consequently, the states of the other variables remain unchanged, and we cannot perform the addition operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is either 1 or greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unaffected due to out-of-bounds access.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 1 or greater than 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unaffected due to out-of-bounds access.**
