According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n ** 2` times. Therefore, if `n` is non-negative (i.e., `n >= 0`), the loop will execute. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. 

Since `dp` is a 2D list and does not influence the number of iterations, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

To summarize for the loop to execute:
- `n` should be greater than or equal to 0 to ensure that the loop runs, and `i` starts from 0.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
