Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]` is updated with the value `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
