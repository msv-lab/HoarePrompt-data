Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, no action is taken.***
