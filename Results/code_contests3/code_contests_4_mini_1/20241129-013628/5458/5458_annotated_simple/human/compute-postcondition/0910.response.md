According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s`, which means the loop has executed for `k = s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented, hence `k` will become `s + 1`. 

Since the loop is defined to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `s + 1` which is not possible. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `j` is at least `k + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s` which is not possible as `k` is now `s + 1`.**
