The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the program will skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of that loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 3`; `k` is 3; and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
