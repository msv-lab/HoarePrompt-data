The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop because of the `continue` statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2; `k` is reset to 1; and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
