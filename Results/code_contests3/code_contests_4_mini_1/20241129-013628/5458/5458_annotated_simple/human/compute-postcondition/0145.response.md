Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to `n` and equals 0, `j` is 2, the dp array has been updated based on the iterations, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (where `k` is equal to `s` which is at least 1).***
