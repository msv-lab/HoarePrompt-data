Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is at least 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][3]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at position [1][j + 1][3] based on the previous values from [0][j][k - j].***
