In this case, the `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop in which it is contained. The values of the variables do not change as a result of the `continue` statement, but it indicates that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 4; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop.
