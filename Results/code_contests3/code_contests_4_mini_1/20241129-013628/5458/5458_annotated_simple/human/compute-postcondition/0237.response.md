The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop (if we were in one) would be skipped, moving to the next iteration without executing any further statements within the loop for this iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
