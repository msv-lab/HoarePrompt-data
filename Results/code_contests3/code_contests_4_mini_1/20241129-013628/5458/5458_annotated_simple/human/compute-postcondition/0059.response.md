Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `k` is 2; `dp` is updated; `m` is greater than the last value of `j`; `j` is now `j + 1`; for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue the loop execution.**
