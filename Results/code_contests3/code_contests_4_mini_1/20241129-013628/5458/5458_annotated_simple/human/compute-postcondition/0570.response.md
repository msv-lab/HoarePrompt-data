The statement assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are provided, but `dp` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine specific values. However, since `j` is equal to `s + 2` and `k` is equal to `s + 1`, we can confirm that the indices used to access the `dp` array are valid based on the conditions provided.

The output state reflects that the assignment operation has occurred, but it does not change the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, or `k`. Therefore, the output state remains the same in terms of those variables.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is equal to `s + 2` (where `s` is at least `N`); `k` is equal to `s + 1` (which is at least 2).**
