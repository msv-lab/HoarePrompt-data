Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then for each `j`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for valid `k`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on previous values, specifically using `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The final values in `dp` will depend on the conditions met during all iterations of the loop.**
