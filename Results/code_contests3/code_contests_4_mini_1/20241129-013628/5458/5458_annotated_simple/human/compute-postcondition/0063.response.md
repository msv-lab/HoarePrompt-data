Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `k` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, `j` is now `j + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
