According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute while `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 1 and for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be 2 and `s` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2**
