The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that a specific index in a multidimensional list or array `dp` is being updated based on the value of another index in the same array. 

In this context:
- `i + 1 & 1` is a bitwise operation which will yield either `0` or `1` based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is not equal to `0`, `i + 1` will be at least `1`, and the result of `i + 1 & 1` will depend on whether `i` is odd or even. 
- `j + 1` is incrementing the value of `j` by `1`, so it will always be greater than `k` since `j` is at least `k + 1`.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged.

The values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on the current value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

However, since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we can only describe the changes in terms of the indices and relationships between the variables.

Since no variables are being changed directly (only a reference in the `dp` array is being updated), the output state will reflect the unchanged initial conditions and the operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is at least `k + 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
