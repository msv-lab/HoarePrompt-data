According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2. Additionally, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, so it is sufficient for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
