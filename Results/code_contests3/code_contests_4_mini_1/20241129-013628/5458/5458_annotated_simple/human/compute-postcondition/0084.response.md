Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, `j` is reset to 1 for the loop to execute, `i` is not equal to 0, and if `j` is greater than `k`, we proceed to the next iteration of the loop.***
