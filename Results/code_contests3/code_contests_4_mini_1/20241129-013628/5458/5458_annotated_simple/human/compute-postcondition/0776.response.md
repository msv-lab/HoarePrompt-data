According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop starts with `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 4. 

Since `s` is at least 3, for the loop to execute for the next iteration, `s` must be at least 4 (so that the upper limit of `k` includes the value of 4). 

The relevant states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` is updated to 4.
- For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 4, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 4.**
