Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the array `dp`. If `i` is greater than 0, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by increasing it with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, reflecting the computed value based on previous states of `dp`.***
