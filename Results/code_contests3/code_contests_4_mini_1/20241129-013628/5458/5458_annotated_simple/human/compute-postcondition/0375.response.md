The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves an assignment to a multidimensional array `dp`. The current values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3.

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` involves a bitwise operation. Since `i` is 0, this evaluates to `0 + 1 & 1`, which is `1 & 1` = 1. Therefore, the first index of `dp` becomes 1.
2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is 3. Therefore, the second index of `dp` becomes 3.
3. The third index is simply `k`, which is 3.

This means we are setting the value of `dp[1][3][3]` to 1. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `s`) are not affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1.**
