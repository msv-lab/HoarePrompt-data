Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is at least `N + 3`, `k` is equal to 1, and `s` is at least 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is either 1 or 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
