The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `k` is 2 and `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2. Therefore, `k - j` could be either 1 or 0, leading to `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` being accessed based on these conditions. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
