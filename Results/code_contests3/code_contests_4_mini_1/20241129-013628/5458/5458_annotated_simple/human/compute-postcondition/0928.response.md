Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and `j` is at least `k + 1`. The `dp` array is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` set to 1 if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. For other iterations, `dp` values are calculated based on previous states and modulo operations.**
