According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.

Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, `k` being 3 will mean that the loop cannot execute again unless `s` is at least 3. 

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration should reflect that `k` is now 3 and that `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
