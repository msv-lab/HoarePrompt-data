Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, and `j` is `s + 1`. The dp array will be updated based on the conditions evaluated during the loop. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be set to 1 for all applicable `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will accumulate values based on previous states of the dp array, particularly from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
