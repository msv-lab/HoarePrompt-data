Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0 and less than `n`, `s` is at least 3, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is 1, and `dp` has been updated based on the loop conditions for all values of `j` and `k` for the loop to execute a second time. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
