The statement assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `j` is 3, which means `j + 1` will be 4. The other variables `i`, `k`, and `dp` are not directly affected by this assignment, but the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` will be copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]`. Since `j` is greater than `k`, it confirms that the operation is valid.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][k]`.**
