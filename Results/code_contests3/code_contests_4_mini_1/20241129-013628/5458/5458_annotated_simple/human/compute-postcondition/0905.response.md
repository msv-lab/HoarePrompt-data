The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the remaining code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is at least `k + 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `s + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
