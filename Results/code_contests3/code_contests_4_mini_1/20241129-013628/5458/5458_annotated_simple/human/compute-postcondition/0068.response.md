The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables `N`, `n`, `k`, and `s` do not change as a result of this command. Therefore, the output state reflects that we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `k` is 3, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
