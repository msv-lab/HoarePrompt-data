The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes multiple datasets that consist of three positive integers: `N`, `M`, and `S`, with the constraints that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`, `1 ≤ M ≤ 2000`, and `1 ≤ S ≤ 3000`. The input ends when the dataset '0 0 0' is encountered, and the number of datasets does not exceed 5. After processing the datasets, the function returns results based on the values of `N`, `M`, and `S`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to read multiple datasets of integers and return results based on the values of these integers. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of three integers N, M, and S, and returns results based on the values of these integers until the dataset '0 0 0' is encountered.**
