The code snippet modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous state indicates that `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, and `k` is 2. The operation does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `s`, or `j` directly.

Let's examine the affected variables:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated.
- `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` will provide the value to be added.

Since `k` is 2, we have `k - j`, which would be `2 - j`. Given that `j` is at least 3, `k - j` would be negative or zero. The output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` but without specific numerical values for `dp`, we cannot determine an exact numerical change.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `j` is at least 3 and less than `m`, and `k` is 2.**
