Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, `k` is 2; if `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, where `j` is at least 3 and less than `m`, and `k` is 2.***
