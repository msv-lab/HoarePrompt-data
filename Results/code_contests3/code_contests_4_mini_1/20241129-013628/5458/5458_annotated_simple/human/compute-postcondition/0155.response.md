Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, the `dp` array may or may not be updated based on whether `j > k`.***
