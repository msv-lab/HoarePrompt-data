Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, if `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1, then if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is either 1 or greater than 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unaffected due to out-of-bounds access.***
