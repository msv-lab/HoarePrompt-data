Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 2 or 1, `j` is 1, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is 1, if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration or statement.***
