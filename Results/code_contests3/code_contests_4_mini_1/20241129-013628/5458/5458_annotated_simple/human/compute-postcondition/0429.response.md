Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the values of the variables.***
