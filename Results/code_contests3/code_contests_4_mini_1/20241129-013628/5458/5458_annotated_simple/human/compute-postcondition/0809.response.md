According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, after the current iteration, `k` will be 2. Since `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to 3**
