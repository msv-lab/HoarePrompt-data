The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is in and continue with the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
