The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 3, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
