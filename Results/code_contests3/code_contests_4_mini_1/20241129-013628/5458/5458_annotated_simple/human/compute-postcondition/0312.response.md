Since the loop is a `while 1` loop, it is designed to run indefinitely. Therefore, there are no conditions that need to be adjusted to allow the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; the output is `dp[n`**
