Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there is no change to the state of the program. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
