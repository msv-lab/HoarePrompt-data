The values of the variables do not change, but the execution of the `continue` statement indicates that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped, and the next iteration will begin. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
