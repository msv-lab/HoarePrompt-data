Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute the first time `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2. Additionally, `i` is equal to 0, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k` (j >= k).***
