The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `k` is 3; `dp[1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][3]` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
