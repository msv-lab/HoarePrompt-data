The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
