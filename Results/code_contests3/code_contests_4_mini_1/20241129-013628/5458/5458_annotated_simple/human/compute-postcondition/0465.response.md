Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least `N`, and `k` is equal to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
