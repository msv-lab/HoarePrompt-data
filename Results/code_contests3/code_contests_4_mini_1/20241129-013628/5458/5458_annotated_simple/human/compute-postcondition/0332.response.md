According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will need to be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 2, and it must still be true that `s` is at least 2 (since `s` must allow for `k` to be incremented). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2.**
