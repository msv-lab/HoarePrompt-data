Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least `3`, `j` is `3`, `s` is at least `N`, and `k` is `s + 1`. If `i` is `0` and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `1` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][k]`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
