According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` can be incremented. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s` (which is greater than or equal to 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute a third time, `k` is incremented by 1, making it 3. 

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2, `k` is 3, and `s` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute a third time**.
