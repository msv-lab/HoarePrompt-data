Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 4, `j` is at least 4, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is less than `k`, the behavior regarding `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unspecified. Otherwise, the conditions for `N`, `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` hold, but the update to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is based on an unspecified value.***
