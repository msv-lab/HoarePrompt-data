According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, so it will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to 1. Since `s` is at least 1, `k` can be incremented to 2 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be 2 and `s` must be at least 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 8, `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `j` is at least `N + 3`, `k` is equal to 2, and `s` is at least 2.**
