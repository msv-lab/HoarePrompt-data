According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. This means that for the loop to execute a new iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Thus, after the current iteration, `k` becomes 5.

Since `s` is at least 4, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be at least 5.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 5, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 5**
