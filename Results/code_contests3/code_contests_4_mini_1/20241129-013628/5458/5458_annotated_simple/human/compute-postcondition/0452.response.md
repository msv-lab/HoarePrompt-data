According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit set by `m`. The loop iterates from `1` to `m`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `m` is at least 2, the next value of `j` would be 3. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 3; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is equal to `s`; for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`.**
