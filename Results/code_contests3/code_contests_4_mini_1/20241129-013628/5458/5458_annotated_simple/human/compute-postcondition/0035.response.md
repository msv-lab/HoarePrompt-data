The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `k` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
