The statement modifies the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The initial state indicates that `k` remains 3, which means that `k - j` will be evaluated based on the value of `j`. The previous values of the affected variables are `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `mod`. 

Since the exact values of `dp` and `mod` are not provided, we can only specify that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the values of other components of `dp`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `k` remains 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `s` is at least 3, `k` remains 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.**
