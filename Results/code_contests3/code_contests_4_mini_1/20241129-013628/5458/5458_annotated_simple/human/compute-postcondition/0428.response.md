The code `continue` indicates that the program will skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement, so we maintain the previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
