Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and if `j` (which is 1) is greater than `k` (which is 2), then `dp[1][2][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Since `j` is not greater than `k`, this part of the code does not execute.***
