According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again as long as `k` remains less than or equal to `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1, making it 2. 

Thus, to execute the loop a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must still be greater than or equal to 2 to ensure the loop can continue executing. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
