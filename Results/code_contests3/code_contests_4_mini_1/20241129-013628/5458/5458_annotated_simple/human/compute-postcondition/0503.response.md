The statement `continue` is used to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since the specific context of the loop is not provided, we can only state that the execution will continue to the next iteration without affecting the current values of any variables.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 4; `j` is at least 4; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is 2; and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
