According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2 (since `j` will increase by 1 to 2), and `j` will be updated to 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is equal to `s`, and for all `k` from 1 to `s`, `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
