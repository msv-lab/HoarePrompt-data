The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a 3D array `dp`. The impacts of this line depend on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

1. The value of `i` can be either 0 or 1. Therefore, `i + 1` can be either 1 or 2. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will yield:
   - If `i` is 0: `0 + 1 & 1` = `1 & 1` = 1
   - If `i` is 1: `1 + 1 & 1` = `2 & 1` = 0

2. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.

3. The value of `k` is 4.

Now we can summarize the different states for the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`:

- If `i` is 0:
  - The index for the first dimension will be 1, and the second and third dimensions will be 3 and 4 respectively. Thus, `dp[1][3][4] = 1`.
  
- If `i` is 1:
  - The index for the first dimension will be 0, and the second and third dimensions remain 3 and 4 respectively. Thus, `dp[0][3][4] = 1`.

Since the values of `N`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` are not changing due to this operation, we will retain their initial values in the output state.

Therefore, we have two possible outcomes based on the value of `i`. However, since we need to provide an output state that reflects both possibilities, we can express it as:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is either 0 or 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 4; `k` is 4; and either `dp[1][3][4] = 1` or `dp[0][3][4] = 1`.**
