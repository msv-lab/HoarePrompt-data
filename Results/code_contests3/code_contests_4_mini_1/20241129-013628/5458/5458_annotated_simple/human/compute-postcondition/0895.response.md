To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can summarize the information given along with the behavior of the loop.

1. The variable `n` remains non-negative throughout the execution, and its value is not changed by the loop.
2. The variable `s` increases as the loop iterates; specifically, after all iterations, `s` will be equal to its initial value (since the loop is based on `k` iterating from 1 to `s`).
3. The variable `k` will take on values from 1 to `s` during the loop iterations. After the loop completes, `k` will be equal to `s` because it increments with each iteration.
4. The variable `dp` is updated based on the conditions involving `i` and `j`. The updates depend on the relations between `j` and `k`, as well as the values stored in `dp` for the previous iterations. By the end of the loop, `dp` will contain values based on the last executed conditions, taking into account the final values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.
5. The variable `j` is only mentioned as being at least as large as `k` or compared against `k` within the loop, so we can conclude that `j` maintains its relationship with `k` throughout the iterations.

After considering the details of the loop's operation and the variables' relationships, we can arrive at the following output state:

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is at least as large as `k`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for the final values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.**
