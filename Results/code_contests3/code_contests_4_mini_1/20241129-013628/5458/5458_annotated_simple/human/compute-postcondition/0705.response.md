The statement assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is calculated using the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The variable `j` is 3, and since `j + 1` becomes 4, and `k` is 2, the indices being used for `dp` are `i + 1 & 1`, 4, and 2. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is not specified, but it is being taken modulo `mod` to compute the new value.

Assuming `mod` is a defined constant, the output state will reflect this assignment without changing the values of `n`, `j`, `m`, `s`, `k`, or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2] % mod`.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `j` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2] % mod.**
