According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is at least 2 or equal to `s + 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to 1. Given that the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it executes, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 3. Since `m` is at least 1, as long as `m` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 1.**
