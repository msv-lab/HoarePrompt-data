Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
