Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is greater than or equal to 2; `k` is 2; `m` is greater than the last value of `j`; `j` is reset to 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
