Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 5, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 5. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop is skipped. If `j` is less than or equal to `k`, the program continues without any changes to the state of `n`, `i`, `s`, `j`, or `k`.***
