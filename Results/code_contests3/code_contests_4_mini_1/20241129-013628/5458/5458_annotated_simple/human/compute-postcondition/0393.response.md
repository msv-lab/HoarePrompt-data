The code `continue` instructs the program to skip the remainder of the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. Since no variable assignments or calculations occur in this line, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of the variables as they were before this statement was executed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is greater than 0; `j` is 3; `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1; `k` is 1; and `j` is greater than `k`; and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
