According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the limit set by `m`. The loop is set to execute while `j` is in the range from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

If `j` is currently at its maximum value of `m`, it cannot execute again. However, if `j` is less than `m + 1`, the loop will execute again. 

Therefore, if `j` is currently at least 2 (and not greater than `m`), it would increase to `j + 1`. Given that `m` is at least 1, there will always be a valid next `j` if `j` is currently less than or equal to `m`.

Thus, the next state would reflect `j` incremented by 1, and `dp` would still be updated based on prior conditions.

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `dp` is updated; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be greater than or equal to 2 or equal to `s + 1`, and `j` will be incremented to `j + 1`.**
