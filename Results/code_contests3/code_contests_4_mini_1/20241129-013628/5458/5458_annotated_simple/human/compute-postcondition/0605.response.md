Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least 8; `i` is either 0, 1, or 2; `j` is at least `N + 3`; `k` is equal to 2; `s` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
