The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the current block of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is `s + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is `s + 2`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.**
