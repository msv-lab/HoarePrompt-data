Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `m`, and `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to the program state. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`**
