Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative. If `i` is 0, then `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1, `j` is at least `k`, and `m` is at least 2. If `j` is less than `k`, no updates occur. Otherwise, if `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.`***
