The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact new value; however, it will now include the contribution from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The states of the other variables are not affected directly by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
