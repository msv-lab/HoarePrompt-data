Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `s` is at least `N` and at least 1, `k` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `j` is incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 5, and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
