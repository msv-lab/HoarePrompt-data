The line of code `n, m, s = map(int, raw_input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s`. The previous states of the variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `mod` are not directly affected, but the values of `n`, `m`, and `s` will now represent the integers that were input. 

Since `N`, `M`, and `S` are within specified ranges, `n`, `m`, and `s` will also be positive integers according to the provided input constraints.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `M` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `M` ≤ 2000; `S` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `S` ≤ 3000; `mod` is 100000; `n`, `m`, `s` are input integers.**
