The operation assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables involved in this operation are `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial states:
- `i` is greater than 0,
- `j` is 1,
- `k` is 1.

The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to a value that depends on the binary representation of `i`. The value of `j + 1` is 2, and `k` is 1. Thus, we are assigning `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`.

Since the exact values of the array `dp` are not provided, we cannot determine specific values for the assignment, but we know that the state of `dp` is updated in this manner.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, and we assign `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1; assign `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][1]`.**
