The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `m` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `s` is at least `N`, `k` is equal to `s`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
