Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least `3`; `j` is `3`; `s` is at least `N`; and `k` is equal to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
