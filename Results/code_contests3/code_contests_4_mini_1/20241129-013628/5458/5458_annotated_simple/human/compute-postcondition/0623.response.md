The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned values based on the input taken from `raw_input()`. The values of `N`, `m`, and `s` will directly depend on the user input. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are replaced by the new input values, but we have no information about the specific input at this time. The output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `s` have been updated to the respective input values.

Output State: **`n` is assigned a value from input, `m` is assigned a value from input, `s` is assigned a value from input**
