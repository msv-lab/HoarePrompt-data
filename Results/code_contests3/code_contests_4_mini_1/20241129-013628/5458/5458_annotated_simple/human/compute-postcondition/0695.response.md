According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be within the range of 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since it is stated that `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute at least once. To ensure the loop executes a second time, `s` must be at least 2, which means the current value of `k` after the first iteration should be 1, and it will increment to 2 for the second iteration. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute a second time, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is non-negative, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the conditions, `j` is 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2 (for the second iteration)**
