Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `i` is 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2; and a value has been assigned to `dp[0][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[0][j][k] % mod`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
