The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3; `dp[1][2][k] = dp[1][1][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or if statement.
