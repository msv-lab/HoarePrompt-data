The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop of which we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 7`; `n` is equal to `N`; `m` is at least `3`; `j` is `3`; `s` is at least `N`; `k` is `s + 1`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
