According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `s`, which determines the range of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `k` is iterating from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute a third time, `s` must be at least 3, since the loop will have the following iterations: `k = 1`, `k = 2`, and `k = 3`. 

Given the current state:
- `n` is non-negative (irrelevant for loop execution),
- `i` is 0 or greater (also irrelevant for loop execution),
- `s` is at least 3 (this satisfies the requirement for 3 iterations),
- `j` is 3 (irrelevant for loop execution),
- `k` is 3 (this will be updated during the loop execution).

Thus, for the loop to execute a third time, we need to confirm that `s` is indeed at least 3. 

State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `s` is at least 3**
