Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`; `k` is reset to 1; if `j` is greater than `k`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
