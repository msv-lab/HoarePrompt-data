Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0, then since `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, an invalid index access on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` occurs, preventing the operation from being completed.***
