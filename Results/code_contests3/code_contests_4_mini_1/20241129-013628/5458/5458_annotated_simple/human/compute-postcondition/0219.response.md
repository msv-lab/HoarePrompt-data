The statement `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next loop iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing in the loop without modifying any variable values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 1; we continue in the loop.**
