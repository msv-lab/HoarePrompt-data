Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `k` is 2, and `s` is greater than or equal to 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not perform any operations.***
