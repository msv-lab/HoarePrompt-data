The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of the loop that it is within. Therefore, while the state of the variables remains unchanged, the execution flow moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
