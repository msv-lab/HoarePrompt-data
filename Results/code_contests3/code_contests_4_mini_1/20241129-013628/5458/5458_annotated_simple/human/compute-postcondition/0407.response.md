According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 3, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3**
