The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `j` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
