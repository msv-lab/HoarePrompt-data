Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is at least `k + 1`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop. The operation on `dp` does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `k`, or `j`, but modifies the `dp` array based on its previous values and the modulo operation.**
