The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates an assignment in a multidimensional array or list where the indices are determined by the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7
- `n` is equal to `N`
- `s` is a positive integer
- `k` is equal to `s`
- `m` is greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is `N + 1`
- `j` is 1
- for the loop to execute the first time, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`.

We need to interpret the indices:
- `i + 1` will be `N + 2` (since `i` is `N + 1`)
- `j + 1` will be `2` (since `j` is 1)
- `k` is `1` (as given)

The operation effectively assigns the value from one position in the `dp` array to another. However, the specifics of the `dp` array are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values.

After understanding this assignment:
- The value at `dp[N + 2 & 1][2][1]` is assigned the value at `dp[N + 2 & 1][1][1]`.

Since the variables `N`, `n`, `s`, `k`, `m`, `i`, `j`, and the relationships between them are defined, but without knowing the content of the `dp` array, we can only state the operation that took place.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to `s`, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 1; `dp[N + 2 & 1][2][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[N + 2 & 1][1][1]`.**
