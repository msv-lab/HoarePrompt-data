The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the surrounding structure. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][2][2]`, and we continue to the next iteration or statement.
