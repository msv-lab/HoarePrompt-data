Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is 3. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, there is no change to the variables. If `i` is greater than 0, `k` remains 3 and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
