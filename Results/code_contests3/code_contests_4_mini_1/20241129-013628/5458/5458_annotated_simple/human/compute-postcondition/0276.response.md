According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. The loop iterates over the range from `1` to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than or equal to `m` (since the loop iterates up to and including `m`). 

Given that `j` is currently at its last value for the loop to execute one more time, it must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`. 

Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. Thus, after incrementing, `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`. 

Therefore, the states need to be updated as follows:

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`; `k` is equal to `s + 1`, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to `m + 1`.**
