The code updates the value of `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value from the index `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are not directly changed by this line of code. However, the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are used to determine the indices in the `dp` array.

Since `j` is 2 and `k` is 1, the expression calculates:
- `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `i`.
- `j + 1` results in 3.
- `k` remains 1.

Thus, the statement modifies `dp` at the position determined by the current state of `i`, while the values of `n`, `m`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod.**
