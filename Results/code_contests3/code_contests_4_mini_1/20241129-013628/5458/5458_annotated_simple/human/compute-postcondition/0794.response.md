Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0 or greater, `s` is at least 3, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and `k` is `s`. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp[1][j + 1][s]` is assigned the value 1 for the final iteration; otherwise, `dp` will be updated based on the conditions provided in the loop for the given indices and modulus operation.**
