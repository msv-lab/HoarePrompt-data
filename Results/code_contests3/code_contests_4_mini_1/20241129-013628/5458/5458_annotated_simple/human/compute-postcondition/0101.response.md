The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, there is no indication of how many iterations have occurred or what the current state of the loop is. The values of the variables do not change, but we effectively skip any remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7; `n` is equal to `N`; `s` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is 3; `m` is greater than the last value of `j`; `j` is reset to 1; and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
