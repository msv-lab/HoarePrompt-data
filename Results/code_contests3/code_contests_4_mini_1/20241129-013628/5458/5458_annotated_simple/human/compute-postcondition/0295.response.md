Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ `m - 2`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `j` is greater than `k`, the loop continues to the next iteration without changing any variable values.***
