Postcondition: ***`n` is non-negative, `i` is 0, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` has been updated at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` to 1, `j` is at least `k`, and `m` is at least 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the conditions remain as stated; otherwise, no updates occur since there is no else part.***
