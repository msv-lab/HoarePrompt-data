According to the code, the execution of the for loop depends on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at the maximum value of `s`, so for the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than `k`. 

Given that the loop is structured to run while `k` is less than or equal to `s`, if `k` is currently equal to `s`, the next value of `k` would be `s + 1`, which exceeds the looping condition. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must have a value greater than the current `k`.

State: **`n` is non-negative, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than `k`, and `k` is currently at `s + 1`**
