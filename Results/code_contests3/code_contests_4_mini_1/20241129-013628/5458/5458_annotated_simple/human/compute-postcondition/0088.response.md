According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute again, `k` will be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2, and `s` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 2, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, and `j` is reset to 1**
