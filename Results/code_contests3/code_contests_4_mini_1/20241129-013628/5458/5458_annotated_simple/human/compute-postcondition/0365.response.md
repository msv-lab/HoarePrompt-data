According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`, which is currently 1, and the upper limit is determined by `s`. The loop executes for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and since `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
