The code `continue` causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated, `m` is greater than the last value of `j`, `j` is now `j + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
