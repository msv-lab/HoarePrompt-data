Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is a positive integer, `k` is equal to 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `N + 1`, `j` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][0] % mod`.***
