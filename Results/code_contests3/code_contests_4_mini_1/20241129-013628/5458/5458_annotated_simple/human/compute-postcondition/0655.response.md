The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables but causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the enclosing loop. The values of `n`, `i`, `m`, `j`, `k`, `s`, and `dp` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables and indicates the continuation of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is non-negative, `i` is either 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is either greater than or equal to 1 or equal to 2, `k` is 3, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
