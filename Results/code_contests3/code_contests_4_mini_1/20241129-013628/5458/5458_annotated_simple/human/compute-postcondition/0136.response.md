The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or condition that we are currently inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 7, `n` is equal to `N`, `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or condition.
