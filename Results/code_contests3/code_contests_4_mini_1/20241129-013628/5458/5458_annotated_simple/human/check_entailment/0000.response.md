Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate and count the valid Bingo cards according to the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization and Logic**: 
    - The dynamic programming (DP) table is initialized incorrectly. The DP table should represent the number of ways to fill the Bingo cards based on the conditions laid out, but the way it's being filled does not account for the ascending order requirement in the columns and the strictly increasing requirement across rows.

2. **Variable Indexing and Conditions**:
    - The usage of the bitwise AND (`&`) operator in `i + 1 & 1` and similar expressions is incorrect. These should be using the modulo operator to toggle between two DP tables. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will not correctly toggle between the two states as intended.

3. **Iterative Logic**:
    - The provided loops appear to be incorrectly structured. The logic for filling in the DP table based on previous states doesn't accurately reflect the constraints given in the problem. For a valid bingo card, the values must not only sum to `S`, but also conform to the rules regarding ordering and the unique placement of integers.

4. **Output Calculation**:
    - The final output calculation is done through a single access to the DP table, which may not yield the correct count of valid Bingo cards. The output should be based on how many configurations were counted, but due to the flaws in the DP logic, this count may not be accurate or even generated correctly.

In summary, due to the issues with the DP table setup, the conditions for valid Bingo card generation, and the logic for filling the DP table, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description. Hence, it cannot reliably produce the correct number of Bingo cards that satisfy all the specified conditions.
