Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input()`. Furthermore, the program does not account for the fact that the length of the input string `w` is stated to be between 1 and 100, inclusive, but it does not enforce or check this constraint within the function. 

Additionally, the program's logic for counting occurrences of characters and checking their parity is correct, but the program's input handling is flawed due to the incorrect function used for obtaining input in Python 3. 

In summary, the issues are:
1. `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()` to work in Python 3.
2. There is no explicit check for the constraints on the length of `w`, although it is implied that it will conform to them based on the problem description.

Because the program does not meet the requirements for input handling and does not validate the constraints, it cannot be considered correct.
