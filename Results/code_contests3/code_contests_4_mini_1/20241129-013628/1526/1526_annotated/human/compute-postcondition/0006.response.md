The code `memo[c] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. If `c` is not already in `memo`, it is initialized to `0`, and then incremented to `1`. If `c` is already present in `memo`, its value is increased by `1`. The values of `w` and `s` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value either `1` if `c` was not in `memo` before, or `memo[c]` increased by `1` if `c` was already present, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value either `1` or increased by `1`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s**.
