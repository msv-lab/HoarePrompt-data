The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. The key `c` is already present in `memo` with its previous value increased by `1`, but now it is reset to `0`. The other variables `w` and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s**.
