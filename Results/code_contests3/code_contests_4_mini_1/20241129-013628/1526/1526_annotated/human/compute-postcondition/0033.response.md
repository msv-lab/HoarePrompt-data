Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100. It counts the occurrences of each character in `s` and checks if all characters have even counts. If all characters have even counts, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not explicitly return any value. **
