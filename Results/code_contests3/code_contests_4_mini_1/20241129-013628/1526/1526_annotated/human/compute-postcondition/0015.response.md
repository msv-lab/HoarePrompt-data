The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For each character, it checks if `c` is already a key in the dictionary `memo`. If `c` is not in `memo`, it initializes `memo[c]` to `0` and then increments it by `1`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `memo` will contain the count of each unique character found in the string `s`.

If `s` consists of characters from `w` and has a length of at least 1, `memo` will eventually include each unique character from `s` as keys, with their corresponding values representing the number of occurrences in `s`. If `s` is empty (which it isn't according to the initial state), `memo` would remain empty.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains the count of each unique character in `s`.**
