According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the first character of `s`, and since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, we need to consider the index of the next character.

Assuming `s` is not empty and has multiple characters, after the current iteration where `c` is the first character, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` would need to be updated to the second character of `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value increased by `1`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the second character of `s`**
