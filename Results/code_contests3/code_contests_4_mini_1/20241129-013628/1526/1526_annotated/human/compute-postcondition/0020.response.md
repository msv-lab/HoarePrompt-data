The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` contains the count of each unique character in `s`, `result` is False, `x` is the first value in memo.values(), and `x` is an odd number; and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
