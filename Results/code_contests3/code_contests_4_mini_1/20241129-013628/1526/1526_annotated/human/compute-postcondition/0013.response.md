Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value `0` if `c` was not previously in `memo`. If `c` is the third character of the non-empty string `s`, then `memo` will reflect this update. There is no change to the state if `c` was already present in `memo`.***
