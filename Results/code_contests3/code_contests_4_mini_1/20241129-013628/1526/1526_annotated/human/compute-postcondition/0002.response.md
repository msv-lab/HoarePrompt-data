According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `s`. The state of `w` does not affect the execution of the loop, but `memo` being an empty dictionary indicates that it has not stored any values yet. 

For the loop to be executed at least once, `s` must be a non-empty string. As the loop starts, the first character `c` should be the first character of the string `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a non-empty string and `c` is the first character of `s**.
