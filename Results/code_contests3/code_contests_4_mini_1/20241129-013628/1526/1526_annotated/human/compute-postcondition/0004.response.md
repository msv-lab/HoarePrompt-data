`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `c` is the first character of `s`, and it is not present in the empty dictionary `memo`, so it is successfully added with a value of `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` now contains the key `c` with value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` now contains the key `c` with value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s**
