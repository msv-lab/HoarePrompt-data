The code assigns the value `0` to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Since `memo` initially contains the key `c` with value `1`, after the execution, the value for key `c` is updated to `0`. The values of `w` and `s` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the third character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value `0`, `s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the third character of `s**.
