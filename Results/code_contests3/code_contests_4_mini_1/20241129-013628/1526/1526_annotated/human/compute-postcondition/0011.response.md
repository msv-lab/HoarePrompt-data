According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, the character `c` is the second character of `s`, and it is given that `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of `1`. Since `s` is non-empty, the loop can execute again for the third character of `s`.

To execute one more time, `c` will need to be updated to the next character in `s`, which is the third character. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `c` is now the third character of `s`, and the loop will continue as long as `s` has at least three characters.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` contains the key `c` with value `1`, `s` is a non-empty string where `c` is the third character of `s`**
