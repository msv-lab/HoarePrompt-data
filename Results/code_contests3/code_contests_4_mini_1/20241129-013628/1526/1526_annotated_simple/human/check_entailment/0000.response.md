Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` from standard input, which is expected to consist only of lowercase letters, complying with the constraints given.

2. **Character Counting**: It uses a dictionary `memo` to count the occurrences of each character in the string. This is done using a loop that iterates over each character in `s` and updates its count in `memo`. This part ensures that all characters in `w` are accounted for.

3. **Even Count Check**: The program then checks whether the counts of all characters are even. It does this by iterating over the values in the `memo` dictionary and checking if any count is odd. If at least one count is odd, it sets `result` to `False`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints 'Yes' if `result` is `True` (indicating that all characters occur an even number of times) or 'No' if `result` is `False`.

This implementation accurately evaluates the "beautiful" condition as specified in the problem description, ensuring that all lowercase letters occur an even number of times in the input string `w`. Thus, for all valid inputs, the program will yield the correct output, confirming its correctness.
