You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Let w be a string consisting of lowercase letters. We will call w beautiful if the following condition is satisfied:

* Each lowercase letter of the English alphabet occurs even number of times in w.



You are given the string w. Determine if w is beautiful.

Constraints

* 1 \leq |w| \leq 100
* w consists of lowercase letters (`a`-`z`).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


w


Output

Print `Yes` if w is beautiful. Print `No` otherwise.

Examples

Input

abaccaba


Output

Yes


Input

hthth


Output

No
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: w is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive.
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        
        memo[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary containing each unique character from `s` as keys and their corresponding counts as values.
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `w` and `s` are strings consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary containing unique characters from `s` and their counts, `result` is either True (if all counts are even) or False (if at least one count is odd).
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
