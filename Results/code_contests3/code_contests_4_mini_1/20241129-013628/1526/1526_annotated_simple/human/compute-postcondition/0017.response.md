According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. For the loop to execute at least once, `memo` must contain at least one key-value pair. 

Before the loop starts, `w` and `s` do not directly influence the execution of the loop, but `memo` must be populated. The current state of `result` being True does not affect the execution of the loop either.

Thus, for the loop to be executed the first time, `memo` must have at least one unique character from `s`, and `x` will represent the first value in `memo.values()`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary containing at least one unique character from `s` with its count, `result` is True, and `x` will be the first value in `memo.values()`**
