According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `c` is the current character in the string. Since `s` has at least 2 characters, it means that there is at least one more character left for the loop to iterate over. 

If `c` is currently the first character in the string, after this iteration, `c` will move to the second character in the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `c` will then be the next character in the string.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `memo` contains the key `c`, for the loop to execute a second time `c` will be the next character in the string `s` after the current character.**
