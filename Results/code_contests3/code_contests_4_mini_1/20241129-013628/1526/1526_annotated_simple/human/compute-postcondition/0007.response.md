According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of `memo[c]` incremented by 1, indicating that `c` was the last character processed. Since `s` has at least 1 character, the loop has processed one character so far. 

To execute the loop one more time, `s` must have at least one more character after the current character `c` has been processed. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the next character in `s` must be processed, and the value of `c` should be updated to the next character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of `memo[c]` incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `c` is the next character in the string `s`.**
