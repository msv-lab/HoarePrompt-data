The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not previously in `memo`, it would have been added with a value of 0, so after the increment, the value would be 1. If `c` was already in `memo`, its previous value would be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `memo[c]` incremented by 1.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `memo[c]` incremented by 1**
