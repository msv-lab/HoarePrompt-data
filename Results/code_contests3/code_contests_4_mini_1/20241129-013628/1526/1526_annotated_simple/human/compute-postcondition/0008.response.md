The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. The previous state of `memo` indicates that `c` was a key with a value incremented by `1`. Now, after executing the code, `memo[c]` is reset to `0`. The states of other variables, `w` and `s`, are not affected.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `memo` contains the key `c` with a value of 0.**
