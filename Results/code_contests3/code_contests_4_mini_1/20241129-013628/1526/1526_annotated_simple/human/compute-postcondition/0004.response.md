`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. The variable `c` is the first character of `s`, and it is confirmed that `c` is not already a key in `memo`, so it is safe to assign `0` to it. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is still the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` now contains the key `c` with a value of `0`, and `c` is still the first character of `s.**
