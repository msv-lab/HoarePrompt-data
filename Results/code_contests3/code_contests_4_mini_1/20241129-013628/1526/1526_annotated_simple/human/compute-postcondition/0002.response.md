According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must contain at least one character, which is guaranteed by the problem statement. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`, assigning the current character to `c`. 

Before the loop starts, `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. The states that need to be established are:

1. `c` will initially be assigned the first character of `s` on the first iteration.
2. The loop will execute as long as `s` has at least 1 character.

Thus, to summarize the state:

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
