The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` and `s` are strings consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary containing at least two unique characters from `s`, `result` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
