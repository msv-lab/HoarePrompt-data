The value of `result` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is a dictionary containing at least one unique character from `s` with its count, `result` is False, `x` is the first value in `memo.values()`, and `x` is an odd integer.
