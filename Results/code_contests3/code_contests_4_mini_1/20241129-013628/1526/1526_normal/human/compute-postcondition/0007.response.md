According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will execute again for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary that has been updated based on the last character `c`. 

Since the loop iterates over each character `c` in `s`, after the last iteration, `c` would be the last character processed from `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be the next character in `s`, meaning the index of `c` must be less than the length of `s`.

If we denote the length of `s` as `len(s)`, the loop can execute again if there are more characters left. Thus, if `c` was the character at index `i`, then in the next iteration `c` should be the character at index `i + 1`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary, `c` is the character at index i + 1 in `s`, for the loop to execute again `s` must have at least i + 2 characters.**
