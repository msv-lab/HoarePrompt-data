Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` is a dictionary. If `c` (the character at index i + 1 in `s`) is not in `memo`, then `memo` is updated with `c` as a key assigned the value 0. If `c` is in `memo`, no changes are made to `memo`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least i + 2 characters.***
