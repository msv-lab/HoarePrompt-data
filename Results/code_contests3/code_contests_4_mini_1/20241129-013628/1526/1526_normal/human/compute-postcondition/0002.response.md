According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `s`. Since `w` is a string of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly, but we need to ensure that `s` is also a valid string.

For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `c` will hold the last character of `s`. 

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character in `s` for the loop to execute the first time**.
