According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values in the `memo` dictionary. The loop iterates over each value in `memo.values()`. If there are more values in the dictionary, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `memo` is non-empty, meaning it contains at least one key-value pair.

Since `result` is False if `x` is odd, the loop may break out if the current value of `x` is odd. To execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more value in `memo.values()` to iterate over. 

If `memo` has multiple entries, and the current `x` corresponds to the value of the last entry, then for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be set to the next value from `memo.values()`. 

Assuming `x` was the last value in the previous iteration and that `memo` contains more than one value, we can set `x` to the next value in the iteration.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a non-empty dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, and `result` is False if `x` is odd; for the loop to execute one more time, `memo` must have at least one more value to iterate over.**
