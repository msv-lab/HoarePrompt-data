According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo[c]` has been updated based on the last character processed. 

Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, if the loop has processed up to the last character, then `c` would be the last character processed in the previous iteration. To execute the loop one more time, the loop will need to process the next character in `s`.

If `s` has `n` characters and the loop has processed `k` characters so far, then for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`. Given that `c` is the last character processed, it indicates that `k` is now equal to the length of `s` minus 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute once more, we need to increment the index to `k + 1` and `c` will be the next character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary; for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be the next character in `s`, and the index must be equal to the length of `s`.**
