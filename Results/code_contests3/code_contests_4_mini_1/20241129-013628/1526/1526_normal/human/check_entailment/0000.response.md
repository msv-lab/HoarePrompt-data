To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if a string `w` is "beautiful", meaning that each lowercase letter in the string occurs an even number of times.

### Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The function reads a string input `s`.
2. It uses a dictionary `memo` to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
3. It checks if each character's count is even:
   - If any character has an odd count, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
4. Finally, it prints "Yes" if `result` is `True` (meaning all characters have even counts), otherwise it prints "No".

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function checks if every character appears an even number of times and prints "Yes" if all characters have even frequencies, and "No" otherwise.

### Initial Assessment:
The code appears to follow the problem description correctly since it counts each character's occurrences and checks their parity. However, there are a few points to consider:
- The function is using `raw_input()`, which is valid in Python 2. If this were Python 3, it should be `input()`.
- The logic for counting and checking even occurrences seems correct, and the program should handle strings of any length from 1 to 100 as specified.

### Edge Cases:
- If the string contains only one character (e.g., `"a"`), the program should return "No" since the count is odd.
- If the string has all even counts (e.g., `"aabb"`), the output should be "Yes".
- If the string has a mix of characters, some with even and some with odd counts (e.g., `"abc"`), the output should be "No".

However, since the hints and the code agree on checking even frequencies, let's now verify if there are any discrepancies.

### Verification with Output Hints:
The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the program:
- The function correctly identifies if all characters in the string have even frequencies.
- The hints do not mention any edge cases that are not handled by the code.

### Conclusion:
Since the code performs as expected according to the problem description and the output hints support this, and there are no identified edge cases that the code fails to address, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
