Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the input properly due to the use of `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3 (it should be replaced with `input()`). This would cause a `NameError` if the program were executed in a Python 3 environment.

Additionally, the program does not account for the scenario where the input string is empty. Although the constraints state that the length of `w` is at least 1, in a different context or future modification of constraints, the logic of handling an empty string would need to be explicitly defined.

Moreover, if we consider the program's correctness based on the condition outlined in the problem description, it does check if each character occurs an even number of times. However, since the use of `raw_input()` is incorrect for Python 3, the program won't run as intended in that environment.

Thus, the program is not correct as it cannot run successfully in a standard Python 3 environment.
