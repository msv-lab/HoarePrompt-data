To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
We need to check if a string consists of lowercase letters and is "beautiful," which means every letter in the string occurs an even number of times.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = raw_input()  # Taking input from the user
    memo = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in memo:
            memo[c] = 0
        memo[c] += 1  # Counting occurrences of each character
    result = True
    for x in memo.values():
        if x % 2 > 0:  # Check if any count is odd
            result = False
            break
    print('Yes' if result else 'No')
func_1()
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input using `raw_input()`. This will work correctly if the function is called in a Python 2.x environment. However, if it's run in Python 3.x, this will result in an error since `raw_input()` is not defined in Python 3.x. It should be replaced with `input()` to be compatible with Python 3.x.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a dictionary (`memo`) to count occurrences of each character, which is appropriate.

3. **Checking Even Occurrences**:
   - The logic checks if the count of each character is even. If any character has an odd count, it sets `result` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly formatted to print "Yes" if the string is beautiful and "No" otherwise.

### Edge Cases:
- Consider the string "a": This string has one occurrence of 'a', which is odd. The correct output should be "No". The program would correctly identify this.
- Consider the string "": An empty string. According to the problem, it should be considered beautiful since all characters (of which there are none) occur an even number of times. The program would output "Yes", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has a critical issue with compatibility due to the use of `raw_input()`, making it incorrect for Python 3.x. However, if we consider the logic applied to the counting and checking for even occurrences, it does work correctly for determining if the string is beautiful.

Given that the program could fail when run in an incompatible environment (Python 3.x), I can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not work correctly in all potential cases due to the dependency on Python 2.x's `raw_input()`.
