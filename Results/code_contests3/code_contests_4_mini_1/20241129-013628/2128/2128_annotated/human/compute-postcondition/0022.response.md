The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The value of `n` is provided from input, but since it is not specified in the initial state, the exact value of `k` cannot be determined. However, `k` will always be one less than `n`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1; `n` is input value; `k` is `n - 1`; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is the largest element in `arr`.
