`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted list `arr` in descending order. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the first element of `arr`.
