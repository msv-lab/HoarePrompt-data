According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute again as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2 so that `l` can take the value 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2, `l` is 2**
