The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input read from the standard input. The `map` function applies `int` conversion to the two values split from the input line. The variable `t` does not change, and `i` remains at 0. The specific values of `n` and `k` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
