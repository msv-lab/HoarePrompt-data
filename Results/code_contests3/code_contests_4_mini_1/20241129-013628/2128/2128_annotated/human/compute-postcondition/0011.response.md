According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, and since `k` is `n - 1` and `n` is at least 2, `k` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented to 2, and for the loop to continue, `k` must be at least 2 (since `l` must be less than or equal to `k`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[1]`, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2**
