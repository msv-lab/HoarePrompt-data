According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k + 1`. The variable `l` is currently 2, and for the loop to execute a third time, `l` must be incremented. Since `l` starts at 1 and goes up to `k`, it will take the next value of 3. 

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3 (because it needs to be greater than or equal to `l` for the loop to continue). 

Thus, we have:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000 (this remains unchanged),
- `i` is 1 (this remains unchanged),
- `l` is now 3 (as it is incremented),
- `ans` is already incremented by `arr[2]` (this remains unchanged).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3**
