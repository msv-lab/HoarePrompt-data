According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

If `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration, after the next iteration `i` will be 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `t` is at least 1, and `i` will be 1 after the next iteration, `t` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute once more.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be at least 2**
