The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 3, `arr[l]` refers to the fourth element of the array `arr` (considering zero-based indexing). The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly provided beyond the conditions mentioned, but `ans` is updated with the value of `arr[3]`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 < `t` â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 2, `ans` is now increased by `arr[3]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be at least 3.**
