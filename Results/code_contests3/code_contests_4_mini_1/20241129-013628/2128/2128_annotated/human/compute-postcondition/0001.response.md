According to the code, the loop is set to iterate `t` times, starting from `i = 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1, since the range function will produce an iterable from 0 up to, but not including, `t`. Given the constraint that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, we know `t` is valid.

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Since `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, they do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
