According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `k`. The loop will execute for values of `l` starting from 1 up to and including `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be increased by 1, making it 3, and for this to be valid, `k` must be at least 3 (since `l` must be less than or equal to `k`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 < `t` â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 2, `ans` is now increased by `arr[l]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be at least 3.**
