The code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, assigning this list to the variable `arr`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered directly by this line of code. The values of `n` and `k` will determine the length of `arr`, but those values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the new addition of the variable `arr` based on input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 < `t` â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the first `min(k, n - 1)` elements of `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers from input.**
