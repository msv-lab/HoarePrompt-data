The code `ans += arr[l]` adds the value of `arr[l]` to `ans`. The previous state mentions that `ans` is the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`, and `l` is 2, indicating that we are accessing the third element of the sorted array `arr` (as indexing starts from 0). 

Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[2]` will be the third largest element. The specific value of `arr[2]` isn't provided, but it will affect `ans`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `ans` has increased by the value of `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 < `t` â‰¤ 1000, `i` is 2, `ans` is now increased by `arr[l]`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `l` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2.**
