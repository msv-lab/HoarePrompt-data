According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1. As the loop increments `i` by 1 for the next iteration, `i` becomes 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 < `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the first `min(k, n - 1)` elements of `arr`, and `arr` remains sorted in descending order.**
