The value of `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`, where `l` is 3. However, the specific value of `arr[3]` is unknown, and thus we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`. Other variables (`t`, `i`, and `l`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `l` is 3, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `l` is 3, and `ans` is incremented by `arr[l]**
