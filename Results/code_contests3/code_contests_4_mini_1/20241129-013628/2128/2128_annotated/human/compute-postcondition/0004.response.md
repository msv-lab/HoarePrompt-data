`arr` is assigned the value of `sorted(arr, reverse=True)`, which sorts the list of integers in descending order. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the sorting of `arr`, while the other variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000; `i` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer; `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
