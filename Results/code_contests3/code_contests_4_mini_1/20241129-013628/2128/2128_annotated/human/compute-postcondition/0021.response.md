`ans` is assigned the value `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted array `arr`. Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` will be the largest element in the array. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order; `ans` is assigned the value of the largest element in `arr`.**
