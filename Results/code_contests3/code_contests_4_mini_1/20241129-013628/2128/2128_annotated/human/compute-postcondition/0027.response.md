The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `ans` increases by `arr[2]`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `k` are not directly affected, and the details of `arr` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` after the operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `l` is 2, and `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[2]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1, `l` is 2, and `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[2]**
