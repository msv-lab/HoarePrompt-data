The list `arr` is assigned the sorted values of itself in descending order. The previous values of `arr` are unknown, as they are based on input. The values of other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorting of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `i` is 1; `n` and `k` are assigned values from input; `arr` is sorted in descending order**.
