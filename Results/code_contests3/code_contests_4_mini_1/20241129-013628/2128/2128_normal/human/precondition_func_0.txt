t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is an integer (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of barrels, and k is an integer representing the number of pourings you can make; a is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial amount of water in each barrel. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
