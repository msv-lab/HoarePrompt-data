According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and since `k` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 3, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 3**
