According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value from input, which could potentially be 0 or negative. Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `t` must be a positive integer. Additionally, `i` starts at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `t` must be greater than 0**
