The value of `ans` is updated by adding `arr[l]` to it. The variable `l` has a value of 2, so `arr[l]` refers to the third element in the sorted list `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans` is now `ans + arr[2]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`, `l` is 2**
