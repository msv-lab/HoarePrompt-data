According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l` in relation to `k`. The loop starts at `l = 1` and continues until `l` is equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `ans` has been updated to include `arr[l]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `l` will become 2. The condition to continue the loop is that `l` must be less than or equal to `k`.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
