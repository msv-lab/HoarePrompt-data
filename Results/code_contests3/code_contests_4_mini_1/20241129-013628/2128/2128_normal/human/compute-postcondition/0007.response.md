The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `k` was previously an integer assigned from input and is greater than or equal to `n`, the new value of `k` will be `n - 1`. Therefore, `k` will now be one less than its previous value, and `k` will still be non-negative because `n` is a positive integer.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is now `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`**.
