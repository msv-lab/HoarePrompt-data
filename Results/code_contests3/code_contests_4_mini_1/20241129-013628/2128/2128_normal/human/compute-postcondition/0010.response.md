The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Given that `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, the value of `arr[l]` will be the second largest integer in the list if `l` is 1. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` after the addition.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[1]`, `l` is 1**
