According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1. The next value of `l` for the loop to execute one more time will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 2, since the range is defined as `range(1, k + 1)`. 

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[1]`, `l` is 2**
