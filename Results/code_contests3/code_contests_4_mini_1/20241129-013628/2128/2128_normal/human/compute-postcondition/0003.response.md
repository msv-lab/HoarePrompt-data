The code creates a list called `arr` by reading a line from standard input, splitting it into components, and converting each component into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation. The state of `arr` will depend on the input provided but is not specified here. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from input, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from input, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input line.**
