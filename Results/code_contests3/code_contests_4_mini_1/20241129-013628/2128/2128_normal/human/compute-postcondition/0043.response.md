According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute again if `k` is greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. Since the loop variable `l` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after the last iteration, `l` would be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be 3 and `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` includes `arr[2]`, for the loop to execute a third time `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and `l` is 3**
