Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is updated to `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the largest integer in `arr` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
