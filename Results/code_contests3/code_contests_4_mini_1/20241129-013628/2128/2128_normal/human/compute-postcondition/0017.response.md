According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is still within the range defined by `t`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.

Assuming the last value of `i` was `t - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `i` will be `t`.

State: **`ans` is the current value based on whether `k` >= 1 or `k` < 1, for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, and `i` is `t`**
