`ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. Since `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the list `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is not provided, but it will be incremented by the value of `arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[2]**
