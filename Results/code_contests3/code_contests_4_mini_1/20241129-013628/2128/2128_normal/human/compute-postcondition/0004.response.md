The list `arr` is sorted in reverse order, which means its elements are rearranged in descending order. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains dependent on the input values of `arr` before sorting. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from input, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**.
