The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The initial state mentions that `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and the first `k` elements of `arr`, and that `arr` is sorted in descending order. However, the previous value of `k` is unknown, but it is now modified to `n - 1`, which could affect the sum calculation of `ans` if `k` was originally greater than or equal to `n`. 

Since `arr` is sorted in descending order, `arr[0]` still holds the value of the maximum element. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is now `n - 1`, and `ans` remains as the sum of the first element of `arr` and the first `k` elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`k` is now `n - 1`; `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and the first `k` elements of `arr`**.
