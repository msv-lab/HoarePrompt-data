`ans` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the sorted list `arr`. The variable `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, so `arr[0]` is the largest integer in the list. The states of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from input, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers assigned from input, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the largest integer in `arr`.**
