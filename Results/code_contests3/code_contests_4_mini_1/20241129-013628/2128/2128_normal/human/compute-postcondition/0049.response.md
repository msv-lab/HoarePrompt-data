Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (the number of barrels) and `k` (the number of pourings) along with a list of integers representing the initial water amounts in each barrel. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the largest amount of water in the barrels and the next `k` largest amounts. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` to be `n - 1`. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case. **
