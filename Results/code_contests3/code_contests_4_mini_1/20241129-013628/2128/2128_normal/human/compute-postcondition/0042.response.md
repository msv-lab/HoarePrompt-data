The code `ans += arr[l]` adds the value of `arr[l]` to `ans`. Since `l` is 2, we need to consider the value of `arr[2]`. The variable `ans` is updated to include this value. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` includes `arr[2]`, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` includes `arr[2]`, and for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
