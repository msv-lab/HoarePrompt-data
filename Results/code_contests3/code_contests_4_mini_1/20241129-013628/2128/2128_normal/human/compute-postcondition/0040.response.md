The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is initialized to 1, `arr[l]` refers to the second element of the sorted array `arr`. The previous value of `ans` is the sum of the first element of `arr` and the first `k` elements of `arr`. The other variables, `arr`, `k`, and `l`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1. 

Output State: **`arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is updated to include `arr[l]`, where `l` is 1.**
