According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `l`, which starts at 1 and goes up to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is at its current value (which would be 1 less than the final value of `k + 1`), and we need to check the conditions for the loop to execute again.

Since `l` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be increased to 2. The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the current value of `l` must be less than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` is likely equal to `k`, meaning for the next iteration to execute, `k` must be at least 2 (so `l` can be incremented to 2), and we need to state the updated values.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order; `ans` is updated to `ans + arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be at least 2 and `l` is 2.**
