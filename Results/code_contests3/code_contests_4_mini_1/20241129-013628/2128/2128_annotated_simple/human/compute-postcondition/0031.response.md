The code snippet `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr`. The variable `ans` is affected as it is printed, but no other variable's state changes as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr`, `l` is `n - 1`, and the value of `ans` has been printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `arr`, `l` is `n - 1`, and the value of `ans` has been printed.**
