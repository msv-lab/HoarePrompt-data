The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. The variable `n` is an input integer, so the value of `k` will be one less than the value of `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is sorted in descending order, `ans` is the largest element of `arr**
