According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute while `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 2, and we know that `k` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time. For the loop to execute one more time, `l` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by `arr[3]**
