The code defines `arr` as a list of integers by mapping the `int` function over the values obtained from a second input line read via `sys.stdin.readline().split()`. This means that `arr` will hold the integer values provided on that input line, but the specific values are not known as they depend on user input. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is a list of integers from the second input line**.
