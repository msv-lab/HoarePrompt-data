The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 2. Since `l` is set to 2, the program accesses the element at index 2 of the `arr` array and adds it to `ans`. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `ans` will be modified based on the current value of `arr[2]`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**
