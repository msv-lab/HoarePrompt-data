The `print(ans)` statement outputs the value of `ans`, which has already been calculated as the sum of the largest element of `arr` and all elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`. The previous values of the affected variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is equal to `k`, and `ans` is the sum of the largest element of `arr` and all elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, which is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is equal to `k`, and `ans` is the sum of the largest element of `arr` and all elements from `arr[1]` to `arr[k]`, which is printed.**
