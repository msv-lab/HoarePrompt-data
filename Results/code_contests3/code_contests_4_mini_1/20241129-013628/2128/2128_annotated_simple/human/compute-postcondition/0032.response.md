According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1, and `i` will be incremented to 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
