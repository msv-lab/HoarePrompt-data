The code sorts the list `arr` in descending order (reverse order). The previous values of `arr` are not specified, but since `arr` is a list of integers, the sorted version will simply be the integers arranged from the largest to the smallest. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are assigned values from input, `arr` is sorted in descending order**
