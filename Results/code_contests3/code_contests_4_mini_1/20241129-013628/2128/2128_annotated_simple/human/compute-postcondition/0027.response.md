The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 2, `arr[l]` refers to the third element of the `arr` list. The previous value of `ans` is the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first, second, and third elements of `arr`, `l` is 2.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first, second, and third elements of `arr`, `l` is 2.**
