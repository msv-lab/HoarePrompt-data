The code assigns the sorted version of the list `arr` to `arr`, with the elements sorted in descending order (reverse=True). The initial state indicates that `arr` is a list of integers based on the input, but the exact contents of `arr` are not specified. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `arr` is now sorted in reverse order, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers; `arr` is sorted in descending order.**
