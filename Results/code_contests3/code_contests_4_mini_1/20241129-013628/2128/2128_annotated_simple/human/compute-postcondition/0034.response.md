The variable `arr` is assigned a list of integers derived from the input read using `sys.stdin.readline()`, which splits the input string and converts each part to an integer. The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from this input, but we do not have their specific values. The variable `t` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2, but these values do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers; `arr` is a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers; `arr` is a list of integers based on the input.**
