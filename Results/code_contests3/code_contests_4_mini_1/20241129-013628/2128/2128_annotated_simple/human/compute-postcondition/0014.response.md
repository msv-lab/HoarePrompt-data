`ans` is increased by the value of `arr[l]`, where `l` is 3. Since the initial state does not provide the specific value of `arr[3]`, we can only state that `ans` is increased by whatever that value is. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by `arr[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is at least 3 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by `arr[3]**
