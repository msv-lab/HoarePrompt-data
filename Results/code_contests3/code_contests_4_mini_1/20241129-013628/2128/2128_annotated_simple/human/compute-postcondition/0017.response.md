According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 1. Additionally, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `t` must be greater than 1**
