The code `ans += arr[l]` adds the value of `arr[l]` to `ans`. 

- The variable `ans` is initially set to the first element of `arr`.
- The variable `l` is 1, which means we are accessing the second element of `arr` (since indexing starts at 0).
- The value of `arr[l]` is the second element of the sorted list `arr`.

Since `k` is `n - 1`, and by the initial state, `k` is less than `n`, we proceed with the addition.

After executing the code, `ans` will now be the sum of its previous value (the first element of `arr`) and the second element of `arr`.

Thus, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`, `l` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first and second elements of `arr`, `l` is 1.**
