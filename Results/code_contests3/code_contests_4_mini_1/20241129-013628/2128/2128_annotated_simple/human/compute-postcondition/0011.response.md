According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is at least 1, so for the loop to execute again, `l` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, if the loop executes again, `l` will become 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be at least 2. 

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]**
