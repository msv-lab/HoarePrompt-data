Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of the largest integer in the list and the next `k` largest integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it adjusts `k` to be `n - 1`. The function outputs the calculated sum for each test case. However, it does not handle cases where `k` is negative or greater than `n`, nor does it validate the input format for the list of integers.**
