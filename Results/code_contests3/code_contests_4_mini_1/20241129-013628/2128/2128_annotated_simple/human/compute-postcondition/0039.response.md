According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop is structured to iterate from `1` to `k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least `1`. Given the state before the loop, `k` is defined as `n - 1`. 

If `n` is greater than `1`, then `k` will be at least `1`, allowing the loop to execute. However, if `n` is `1`, then `k` will be `0`, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, we need `n` to be greater than `1`, which ensures `k` is at least `1`. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, `l` will be initialized to `1` for the first iteration. 

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `l` is 1.**
