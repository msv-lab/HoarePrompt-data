The value of `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`. The previous value of `l` is 2, and since `arr` is an array, `arr[2]` will be accessed. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is 2, `ans` is increased by `arr[2]`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.**
