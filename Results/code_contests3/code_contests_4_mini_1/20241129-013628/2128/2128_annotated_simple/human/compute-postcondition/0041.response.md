According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `l` in relation to `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1 and `k` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `l` being 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than or equal to `k`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (since `k` is `n - 1`, making `k` at least 2).

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is 2, and `ans` is increased by `arr[l]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
