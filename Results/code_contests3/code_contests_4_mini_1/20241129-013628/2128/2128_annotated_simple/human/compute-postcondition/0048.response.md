The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it does not have any input parameters defined in its signature. Instead, it operates based on predefined constraints that involve several variables: `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, constrained to be between 1 and 1000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer that represents the size of the list `a`, and it is constrained such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`.
- `k` is an integer constrained such that `1 ≤ k < n`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is non-negative and constrained by `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`.

The function processes these inputs and produces output based on the logic defined within its body. However, the exact nature of the output is not specified in the provided information.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases defined by constraints on integers `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers, but does not take any input parameters directly. The output is determined by the internal logic of the function based on these defined constraints.**
