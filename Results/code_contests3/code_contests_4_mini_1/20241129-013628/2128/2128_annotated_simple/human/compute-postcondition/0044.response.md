The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `arr[l]` to it. The value of `l` is 3, and since `n` is at least 4, `arr[3]` is accessible. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it is increased by `arr[3]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the increase in `ans` and does not affect other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is equal to `n - 1`, `l` is 3, `ans` is increased by `arr[3]`.**
