The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `arr[l]`. Since `l` is 3, the code adds the fourth element of the list `arr` (considering 0-based indexing) to `ans`. The previous value of `ans` is the sum of the first, second, and third elements of `arr`. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans` will be increased by the value of `arr[3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the first, second, third elements of `arr` plus `arr[3]`, `l` is 3.**
