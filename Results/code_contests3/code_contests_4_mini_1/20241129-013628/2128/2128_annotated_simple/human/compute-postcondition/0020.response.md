The `arr` list is sorted in reverse order, which means the highest values will be at the start of the list. The original values of `arr` are affected by this sorting operation, but the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the change in `arr` while noting that the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are two integers from input, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order.**
