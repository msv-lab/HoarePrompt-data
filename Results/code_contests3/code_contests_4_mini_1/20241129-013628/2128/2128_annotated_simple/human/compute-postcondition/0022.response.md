The variable `k` is assigned the value of `n - 1`. Since `n` is an integer from input, the specific value of `k` will depend on the value of `n`. Other variables remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `n - 1`, `arr` is the sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans` is the first element of `arr**
