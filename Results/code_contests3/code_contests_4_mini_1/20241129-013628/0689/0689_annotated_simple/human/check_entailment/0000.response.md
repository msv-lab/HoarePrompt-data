Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. Specifically, the function uses `raw_input()`, which is not defined in Python 3; the correct function should be `input()`. Additionally, the way the program checks for rotation is flawed in its output mechanism.

1. **Input Handling**: The program is written as if it is intended for Python 2, where `raw_input()` is valid. In Python 3, it should simply use `input()`. This would cause a runtime error in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Output Format**: The program uses `print['No', 'Yes'][...]`, which is incorrect syntax. It should be using parentheses, like `print(['No', 'Yes'][...])`. This would also lead to a runtime error.

3. **Logic Check**: The logic for checking if `S` equals `T` after rotation is correct, as it constructs all possible rotations of `T` and checks them against `S`. However, the printing of the result does not match the output requirements stated in the problem description. The problem statement asks for "Yes" or "No", whereas the program outputs "Yes" or "No" based on the indexed list, which is correct but combined with the syntax issues makes it fail.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description correctly in all cases.
