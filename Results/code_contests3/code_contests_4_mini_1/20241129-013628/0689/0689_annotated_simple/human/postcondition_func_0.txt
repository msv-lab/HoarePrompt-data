The function accepts two strings `s` and `t`, both of equal length (between 2 and 100 characters) consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if string `s` can be obtained by rotating string `t` (i.e., shifting characters in `t` around). If `s` can be formed by rotating `t`, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. Note that the function does not handle cases where the inputs do not meet the expected conditions, such as non-string inputs or strings of different lengths, but it is expected to receive valid input as per the preconditions.
