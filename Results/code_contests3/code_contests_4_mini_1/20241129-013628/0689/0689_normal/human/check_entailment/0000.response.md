To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the elements:

### Problem Description
The goal is to determine if string `S` equals string `T` after performing a rotation operation on `T`. The rotation operation involves moving the last character of `T` to the front, and this can be repeated several times. 

### Program Analysis
The program reads two strings `s` and `t`, then uses a generator expression to check all possible rotations of `t` to see if any of them equals `s`. If any rotation matches, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. 

```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Length:** For the minimum allowed length of strings (2), the program should handle cases like `s = "ab"` and `t = "ba"`. It should return 'Yes' since rotating `t` gives `s`.

2. **All Characters the Same:** For strings like `s = "aaa"` and `t = "aaa"`, it should return 'Yes' since all rotations are the same.

3. **Different Characters:** For strings like `s = "abc"` and `t = "def"`, it should return 'No'.

4. **Exact Matches:** For identical strings, such as `s = "hello"` and `t = "hello"`, it should return 'Yes'.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function checks if `s` can be formed by any rotation of `t`. This aligns with the generated output of the program, as it checks all possible rotations of `t`.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program handles all cases outlined in the problem description correctly. The generator expression effectively checks every possible rotation of `t`, and the use of `any` ensures that if any rotation matches `s`, it will return 'Yes'.

Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
