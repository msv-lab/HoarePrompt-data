The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100 characters inclusive, and the lengths of `S` and `T` are equal. The function performs an operation based on these strings, but the specific output has not been provided in the given constraints. Therefore, we cannot describe the exact return value without additional information about the output of the function.
