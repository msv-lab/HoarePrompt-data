To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the code snippet provided while considering the initial state of the variables.

1. The code checks if the string `s` is a rotation of the string `t` using the expression `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))`. This means it checks if `s` can be obtained by taking any rotation of `t`.
2. The `print` statement will output either 'No' or 'Yes' based on whether the condition evaluates to `True` or `False`.
3. The initial values of `S`, `T`, `s`, and `t` are not explicitly defined, but they are specified as strings of lowercase English letters. Therefore, the outcome will depend on the specific values of `s` and `t` as inputs.

The output state will reflect that a value has been printed based on the comparison of `s` and rotations of `t`.

Output State: **`S` is a string of lowercase English letters, `T` is a string of lowercase English letters, `s` is an input string of lowercase English letters, `t` is an input string of lowercase English letters, and the result printed is either 'No' or 'Yes' based on the rotation check.**
