To determine if the provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, let's analyze both the problem description and the code provided.

### Problem Description Overview:
1. **Input**: Two strings, S and T, consisting of lowercase English letters with equal lengths.
2. **Goal**: Determine if S equals T after any number of specified rotations.
3. **Output**: Print "Yes" if S can be obtained from T by rotations, otherwise print "No".

### Understanding the Rotation:
The rotation operation defined means moving the last character of the string to the front. For instance, rotating "abc" gives "cab", then "bca", and finally back to "abc". 

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func():
    s = raw_input()
    t = raw_input()
    print['No', 'Yes'][any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))]
```

#### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Reading**: It reads two strings `s` and `t` from input.
2. **Checking Rotations**: The expression `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` checks if `s` can be obtained by any rotation of `t`.
   - `t[i:] + t[:i]` constructs the rotated version of `t` by slicing at index `i`.
   - The `any()` function returns `True` if at least one rotation matches `s`.
3. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" if a match is found, otherwise "No".

### Verification Against the Problem Description:
- **Input Constraints**: The program reads two strings and assumes they are of equal length and consist of lowercase letters, adhering to the problem constraints.
- **Logic for Rotation Matching**: The method used (checking all possible rotations) is correct. The concatenation of `t` with itself (`t+t`) can also be used to check for the substring `s` since any rotation of `t` will appear as a substring in `t+t`.
- **Output**: The program correctly responds with "Yes" or "No" based on whether `s` can be produced from `t` via rotation.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accurately checks if one string can be obtained from another through rotations and adheres to all constraints.

Correctness: **True**
