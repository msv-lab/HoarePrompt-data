Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a mistake in how it checks for string rotations. The line `print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]` is using incorrect syntax for `print`; it should be `print(['No', 'Yes'][...])` instead of `print[...]`.

Moreover, the logic for checking rotations is flawed. While it does attempt to check if by rotating `T` it can equal `S`, it does so in a way that could lead to incorrect conclusions based on the output index and the way it evaluates the list. 

For example, if the input is:

```
abc
cba
```

The expected output should be "No", but the program will incorrectly evaluate some cases due to the way it handles the index and the rotations.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if `S` equals `T` after rotations, and it fails to handle all edge cases.
