According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. Given that the current state indicates `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, these values do not directly affect the execution of the loop. The critical variable is `arr1[0]`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. Additionally, since `j` starts from 1, it will be 1 during the first execution of the loop.

State: **`arr1` is updated to contain the integers from the input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1**
