The line of code `maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)` assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current `maxval`. The previous value of `maxval` is `arr[0]`. 

The impact of this code depends on the value of `arr[i]`. Since we know `i` is 1, this means we are considering `arr[1]`. If `arr[1]` is greater than `maxval` (which is `arr[0]`), `maxval` will be updated to `arr[1]`. If not, it will remain as `arr[0]`.

The state of other variables is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` contains the integers from the input, `maxval` is either `arr[0]` or `arr[1]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` plus `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains the previous values plus `temp`, and the value of `maxval` has been updated based on the comparison.

Output State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `maxval` is either `arr[0]` or `arr[1]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` plus `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains the previous values plus `temp`, and `maxval` has been updated.**
