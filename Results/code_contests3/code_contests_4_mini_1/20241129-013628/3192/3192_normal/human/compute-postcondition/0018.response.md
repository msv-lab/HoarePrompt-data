The code assigns `arr1` the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input()`, which takes a space-separated string of integers as input. The previous state of `arr1` is not defined before this assignment, but after execution, `arr1` will contain the integers provided by the input. The other variables `n`, `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
