`arr` is appended with the value of `temp`. The previous values show that `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` now contains the value of `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` now contains the value of `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1.**
