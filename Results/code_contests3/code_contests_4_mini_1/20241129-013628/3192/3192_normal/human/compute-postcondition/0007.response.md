According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the range function in Python will generate numbers from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `arr` and `arr2` are empty lists, `maxval` is 0, `i` is 0, and `temp` is 0, the critical variable that influences whether the loop will run is `arr1[0]`.

For the loop to execute at least once, we require that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Additionally, before the loop begins, the variable `j` is initialized to 1, which is the starting point of the loop.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `arr1` must contain at least one element and that element must be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
