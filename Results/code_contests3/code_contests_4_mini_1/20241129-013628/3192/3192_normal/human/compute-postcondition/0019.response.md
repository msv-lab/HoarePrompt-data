`temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` contains the integers from the input, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, and `temp` is 0.
