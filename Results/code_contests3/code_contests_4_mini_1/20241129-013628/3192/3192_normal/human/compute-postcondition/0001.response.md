The code initializes an empty list `arr`. There are no prior values of `arr`, and the value of `n` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `arr` while indicating that `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list.**
