The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`. Given that the code snippet references `arr1[j]`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be equal to 2. Therefore, the value of `arr1[j]` is `arr1[2]`, which is unknown but assumed to be an integer since `arr1` is a list of integers.

Since the exact value of `arr1[2]` is not provided, we can say that `temp` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[2]`. If `arr1[2]` is greater than 0, then `temp` will take that value; otherwise, it will remain 0.

Thus, the output state reflects the potential update of `temp` based on the value of `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[2]`**
