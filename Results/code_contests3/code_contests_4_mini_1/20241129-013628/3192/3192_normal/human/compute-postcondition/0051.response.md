The loop iterates through all `n` lists and updates `ans` by calculating the differences between `maxval` and each value in `arr`, multiplied by the corresponding sizes in `arr2`. After all iterations, `i` will equal `n - 1`, and `ans` will contain the total sum of these differences for all lists.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` lists; `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` lists; `i` is `n - 1`; `arr1` is the last list of integers processed; `temp` is the maximum value from the last `arr1` excluding the first element; `ans` is updated to the total sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
