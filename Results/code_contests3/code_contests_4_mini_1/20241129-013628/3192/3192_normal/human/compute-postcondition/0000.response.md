The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input that represents a positive integer and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` will be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200000. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000**
