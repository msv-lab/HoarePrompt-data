Output State: **`arr1` is updated to contain the integers from the input with `arr1[0]` greater than 2; `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`; `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` is appended with `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]` appended to it; `maxval` is updated to the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous value of `maxval`.**
