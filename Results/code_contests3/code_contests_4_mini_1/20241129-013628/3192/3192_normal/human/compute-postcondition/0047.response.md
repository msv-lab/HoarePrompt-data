According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the index variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute a total of `n` times, where `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, it is guaranteed that `n` is at least 1, allowing for another iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will need to be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` lists; `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` lists; `i` is 1; `arr1` is the last list of integers processed; `temp` is the maximum value from the last `arr1` excluding the first element; `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`**
