According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, and for the loop to execute once more, `i` must be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` lists, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` lists, `i` is 2, `arr1` is the last list of integers processed, `temp` is the maximum value from the last `arr1` excluding the first element, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
