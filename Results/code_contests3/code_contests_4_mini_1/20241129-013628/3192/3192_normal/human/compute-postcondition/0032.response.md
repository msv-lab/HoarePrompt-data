The variable `temp` is initialized to 0, but no other variables are affected by this statement. The previous values of `arr1`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is updated to contain the integers from the input; `maxval` has been updated; `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` plus `arr1[0]`; `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 2; `temp` is 0.
