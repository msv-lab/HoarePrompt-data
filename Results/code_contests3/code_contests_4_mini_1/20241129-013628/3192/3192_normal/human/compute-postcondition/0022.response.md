According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr1` array. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `arr1[0] - 1`, since the `xrange` function goes up to but does not include the upper limit. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2. Therefore, we must ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
