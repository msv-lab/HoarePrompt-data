According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which represents the range for the loop. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0]` contains integers from the input with `arr1[0]` being greater than 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`arr1` is updated to contain the integers from the input with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
