Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` lists; `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` lists; `i` is `n - 1`; `arr1` is the last list of integers processed; `temp` is the maximum value from the last `arr1` excluding the first element; `ans` is updated to the total sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`; the value of `ans` has been printed.**
