`maxval` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `n` and `arr` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
