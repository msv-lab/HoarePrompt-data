The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and since `j` is 1, we evaluate `arr1[1]`. The value of `arr1[1]` is not provided, but since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr1[1]` could be any integer value. Thus, `temp` will be updated to either its current value of 0 or the value of `arr1[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
