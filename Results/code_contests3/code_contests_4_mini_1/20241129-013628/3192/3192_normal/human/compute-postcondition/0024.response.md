According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, the new value of `j` will be 3, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, `temp` is updated to either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, `maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 3**
