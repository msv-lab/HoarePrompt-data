Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum of `temp` (0) and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 1; therefore, `temp` is updated to the value of `arr1[1]`.**
