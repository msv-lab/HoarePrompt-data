The loop iterates `n` times, where in each iteration it reads a new list of integers from the input, calculates the maximum value from that list (excluding the first element), and updates the `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` variables accordingly. 

After all iterations of the loop have completed, the following states can be inferred:

- `arr` will contain `n` values, each representing the maximum value from the corresponding `arr1` lists processed during each iteration.
- `arr2` will contain `n` elements, each being the first element of the corresponding `arr1` lists, which indicates the size of the lists.
- `maxval` will be the maximum value among all the calculated maximums stored in `arr`, which could be any of the values in `arr` depending on the inputs.
- `i` will be `n - 1`, representing the last index of the loop.
- `arr1` will hold the last list of integers read during the final iteration.
- `temp` will hold the maximum value calculated from the last `arr1` list.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` lists; `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` lists; `i` is `n - 1`; `arr1` is the last list of integers processed; `temp` is the maximum value from the last `arr1` excluding the first element.**
