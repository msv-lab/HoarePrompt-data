To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the information given and understand how the loop operates. The loop is governed by the variable `i`, which is incremented with each iteration, and it will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

1. From the given state, `i` is currently 1.
2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
3. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a third time.
4. The variable `maxval` has been updated, and `arr` now contains values based on the previous state and `temp`.

Therefore, we can summarize the required state for the next iteration.

State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `maxval` has been updated, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]` plus `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
