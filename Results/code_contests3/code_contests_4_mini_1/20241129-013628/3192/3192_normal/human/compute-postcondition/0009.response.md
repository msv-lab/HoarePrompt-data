According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the first element of the list `arr1`, which indicates how many iterations the loop should run based on its value. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 

Since `j` starts at 1 and increments with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 2. For this condition to hold, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 2`; `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` (0) and `arr1[1]`; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 2.**
