The code initializes `arr2` as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `arr`, and `maxval` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables, and `arr2` is simply an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.**
