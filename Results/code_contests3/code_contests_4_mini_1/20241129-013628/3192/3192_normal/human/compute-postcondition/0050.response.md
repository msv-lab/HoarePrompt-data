The variable `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to evaluate `arr[2]` and `arr2[2]`. The other variables `n`, `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` remain unchanged. 

The output state will now include the updated value of `ans` based on this calculation. Since we don't have the specific values of `arr[i]`, `arr2[i]`, or `ans`, the output must reflect that the calculation was performed without specific numerical results.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`**
