`arr2` is updated by appending the value of `arr1[0]` to it. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `arr2` will now contain one element which is the value of `arr1[0]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` now contains the value of `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` now contains the value of `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1.**
