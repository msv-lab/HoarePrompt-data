`temp` is assigned the value `0`, and since it is a new variable, it does not affect any other existing variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers based on input, `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers based on input, `temp` is 0**
