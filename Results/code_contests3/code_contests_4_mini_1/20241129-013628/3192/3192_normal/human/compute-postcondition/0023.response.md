The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `arr1[j]` is equivalent to `arr1[2]`, the new value of `temp` will be the greater of these two values. The values of `maxval`, `arr2`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `temp` is updated to either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is updated to either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, `maxval` is `arr1[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
