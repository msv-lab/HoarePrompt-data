According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `arr1` contains the integers from the input.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000.
- `arr` now contains the value of `temp`.
- `maxval` is `arr[0]`.
- `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`.
- `i` is 1.
- `temp` is 0.

For the loop to execute for the first time, we need `arr1[0]` to be greater than 1. The variable `j` starts at 1, so if `arr1[0]` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and at the beginning of the loop, `j` will be 1.

State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
