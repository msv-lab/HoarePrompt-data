The code assigns the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval` to `maxval`. Given the initial state, `maxval` is 0. The value of `arr[i]` is not explicitly defined but is based on the index `i`, which is 0. Therefore, `maxval` will take the maximum of `arr[0]` (which is equal to `temp`) and 0. Since `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1`, `temp` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to the previous `maxval` (0). 

Thus, `maxval` will be updated to the value of `arr[i]`, which is `arr[0]`. 

The output state will reflect this change. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `arr` now contains the value of `temp`; `maxval` is `arr[0]`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0]-1.**
