To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we note the following:

- The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = arr1[0] - 1`.
- `temp` is updated during each iteration to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`.
- Since `n` is greater than 2, we can infer that `arr1[0]` is at least 3, enabling at least two iterations (j = 1 and j = 2).
- The loop continues until `j` reaches `arr1[0] - 1`, which means it will check all values `arr1[1]` through `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

At the end of the loop:
- `temp` will hold the maximum value found in the elements of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`.
- `j` will be equal to `arr1[0]` after the final iteration, as it increments to that value when the loop exits.
  
Therefore, the output state can be defined as follows:

Output State: **`arr1` is updated to contain the integers from the input with `arr1[0]` greater than 2; `temp` is the maximum value of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`; `j` is `arr1[0]`.**
