The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, and during each iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. After all iterations, `temp` will hold the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. 

If `arr1[0]` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0, as initialized. 

In summary, after all iterations of the loop have completed:

- If `arr1[0]` is 1, `temp` will be 0.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` will be the maximum value from the elements `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

Output State: **`arr1` contains the integers from the input, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
