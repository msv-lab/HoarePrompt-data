The code assigns the value of `arr1` to a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input from `raw_input()`. Since `arr1` is initialized with the input values, the previous states of `arr`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `arr1` will be a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers based on input.**
