According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n` times, starting from `i = 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`. 

Since the loop's condition is based on `i` being less than `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` will be 1 after increment). 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` now contains the value of `temp`, `maxval` is `arr[0]`, `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
