According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer between 1 and 200000, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. Additionally, since `arr` and `arr2` are empty, their states do not affect the loop's execution. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be set to 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
