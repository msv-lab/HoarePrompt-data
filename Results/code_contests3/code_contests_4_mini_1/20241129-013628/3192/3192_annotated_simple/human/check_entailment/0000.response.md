The provided program is designed to solve the problem of merging companies while adhering to certain salary increase rules. Let's break down the program and see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of companies, followed by `n` lines that describe each company's employee salaries. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Finding Maximum Salaries**: The program correctly identifies the maximum salary in each company and stores these values in a list called `arr`. It also keeps track of the overall maximum salary across all companies in `maxval`. This is also consistent with the requirements as the merging is only possible when maximum salaries are equal.

3. **Calculating Total Increase**: For each company, the program calculates the total increase needed to make all maximum salaries equal to `maxval`. This is done by computing the difference between `maxval` and the maximum salary of each company, multiplied by the number of employees in that company (stored in `arr2`). This approach effectively computes the total salary increase required for all companies to reach the necessary maximum salary for merging.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program outputs the total increase, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

### Verification:

- The program correctly calculates the necessary increases based on the maximum salaries.
- It ensures that all employees within each company receive an equal raise, which is one of the conditions stated in the problem description.
- It aggregates the raise needed for all companies to match the maximum salary, thus minimizing the total increase, which is the goal.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input as specified, processes the salary data to find maximum values, and calculates the required salary increases to allow all companies to merge legally according to the anti-monopoly service's rules.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be affirmed.

Correctness: **True**
