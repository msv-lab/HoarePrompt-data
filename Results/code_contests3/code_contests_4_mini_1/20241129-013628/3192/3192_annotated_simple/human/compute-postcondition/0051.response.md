The loop iterates `n` times, where `i` takes values from `0` to `n-1`. During each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of the difference between `maxval` and the `i`-th element of `arr`, multiplied by the `i`-th element of `arr2`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain the cumulative result of these calculations.

If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute `n` times, and `ans` will contain the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `ans` will remain as it was initialized, which is `0`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` is the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
