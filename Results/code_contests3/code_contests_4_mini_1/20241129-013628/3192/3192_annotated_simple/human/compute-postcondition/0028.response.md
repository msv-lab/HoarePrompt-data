`arr2` is updated by appending the value of `arr1[0]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `arr2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least `arr1[0]` elements, `temp` is the maximum of the elements in `arr1` from index `1` to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`, `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]`.**
