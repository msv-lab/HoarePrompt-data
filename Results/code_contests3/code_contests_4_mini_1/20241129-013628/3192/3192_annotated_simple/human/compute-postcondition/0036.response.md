`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` can either be 0 or `arr1[1]`, and `arr1[j]` is `arr1[2]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]` can be any integers but we don't have their specific values. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible changes to `temp` based on the comparison. 

The output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, and `temp` is now either `arr1[2]` or remains as it was.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either `arr1[2]` or remains as it was, `j` is 2.**
