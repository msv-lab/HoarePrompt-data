To determine the output state after running the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. `temp` is assigned the value of the maximum between `temp` and `arr1[j]`.
2. `temp` can either be `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, as stated in the initial state.
3. The value of `arr1[j]` is referenced, where `j` is 3. Hence, `arr1[3]` is used in the comparison.
4. Since `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a third time, `arr1` must have at least 4 elements, allowing `arr1[3]` to be valid.

Now, calculating the result:
- If `temp` is `arr1[1]`, `temp` will become the maximum of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[3]`.
- If `temp` is `arr1[2]`, `temp` will become the maximum of `arr1[2]` and `arr1[3]`.

The output state will reflect that `temp` is now the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3**.
