According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once because `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized, and in Python, it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `i` should be set to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
