According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 since `arr1[0]` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2**
