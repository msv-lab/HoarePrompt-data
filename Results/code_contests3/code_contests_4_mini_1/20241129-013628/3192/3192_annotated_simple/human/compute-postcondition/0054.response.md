The function `func` accepts input representing multiple companies, where each company has a certain number of employee salaries. It reads the count of companies and processes each company's salary data, calculating the maximum salary within each company. It then computes a total value based on the difference between the highest salary across all companies and the maximum salary of each company, multiplied by the number of employees in that company. The result is printed as the output. However, the function does not handle cases where there are no companies or where the input is malformed, which could lead to runtime errors. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input representing the number of companies, followed by salary data for each company, and calculates the total difference in salaries compared to the maximum salary across all companies, then prints the result. It does not handle cases of invalid input or zero companies. **
