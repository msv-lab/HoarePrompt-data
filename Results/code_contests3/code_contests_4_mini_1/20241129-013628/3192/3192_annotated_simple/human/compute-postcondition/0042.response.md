The code snippet assigns the maximum value from the list `arr` at index `i` to `maxval`, comparing it with the current value of `maxval`. The value of `arr[i]` is not provided, but it is known that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 2. The previous value of `maxval` is not known, so we must represent it as is. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1, `temp` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.**
