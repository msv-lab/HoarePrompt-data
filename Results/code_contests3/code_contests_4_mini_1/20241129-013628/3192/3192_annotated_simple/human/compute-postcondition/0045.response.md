According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, it means that `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, which is valid as long as `n` is at least 1. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following conditions need to be satisfied:
1. `n` must be greater than 0 (which it is, as given).
2. The loop will start with `i = 0`, since `range(n)` generates values from `0` to `n-1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to confirm that `i` will be initialized to `0` at the start of the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
