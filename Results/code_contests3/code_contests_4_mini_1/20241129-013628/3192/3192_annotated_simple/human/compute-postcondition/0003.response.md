`arr2` is assigned an empty list, and this operation does not affect the existing variables `n`, `arr`, or `maxval`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, and `arr2` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list**
