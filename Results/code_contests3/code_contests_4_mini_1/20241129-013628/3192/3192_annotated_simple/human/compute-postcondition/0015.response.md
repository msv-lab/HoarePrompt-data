The code appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. The value of `arr1[0]` is known as it represents the first element of the list `arr1`, which is an integer. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr2` now contains this integer value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is a list containing `arr1[0]`, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1.**
