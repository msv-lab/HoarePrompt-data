The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we are looking at the value `arr1[1]`. The exact value of `arr1[1]` is unknown, but we know that `arr1[0] > 1`, indicating that `arr1` contains integers greater than 1. Therefore, `arr1[j]` (or `arr1[1]`) must also be a positive integer.

After the assignment, `temp` will either remain 0 (if `arr1[1]` is less than or equal to 0, which cannot happen since `arr1` contains positive integers) or take on the value of `arr1[1]` (which is greater than 0).

Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is now `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is now `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
