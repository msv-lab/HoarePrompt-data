The code assigns `arr1` the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input().split()`. This means `arr1` will hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The variables `n`, `i`, `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Since `arr1` will depend on the input, which is not known at this moment, we cannot specify its values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers based on input.**
