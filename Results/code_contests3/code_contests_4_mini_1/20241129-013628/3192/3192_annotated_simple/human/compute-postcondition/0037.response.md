According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the list `arr1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 (as stated), the loop can execute again.

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is either `arr1[2]` or remains as it was, `j` is 3**
