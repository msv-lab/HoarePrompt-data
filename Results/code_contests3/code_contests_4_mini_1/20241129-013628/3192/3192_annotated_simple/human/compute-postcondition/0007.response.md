According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. Since `n` is a positive integer but `arr1` is a list of integers based on input, the first element `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Additionally, the variable `j` will start at 1. 

Currently, `arr` and `arr2` being empty and `maxval` being 0 do not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `arr1` has at least one element and that the first element `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
