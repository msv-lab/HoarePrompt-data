The code `arr2.append(arr1[0])` appends the value of `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`. Since `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `arr2` will now have one more element equal to `arr1[0]`. The values of the other variables `n`, `i`, `temp`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` at least 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1, `temp` is appended to `arr`, `arr2` now includes `arr1[0]`**
