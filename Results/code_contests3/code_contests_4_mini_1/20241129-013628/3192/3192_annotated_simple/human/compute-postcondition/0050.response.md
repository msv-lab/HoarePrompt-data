The statement `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]` to it. The state of other variables is not affected directly, but we need to consider the current values of `i`, `arr`, and `arr2`. 

Given that `i` is 2, `arr[i]` refers to `arr[2]` and `arr2[i]` refers to `arr2[2]`. The specific values of `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` are not provided; therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` after this operation.

However, we know that `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, which indicates that `arr` and `arr2` should have valid values at index 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is 2; `ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]**.
