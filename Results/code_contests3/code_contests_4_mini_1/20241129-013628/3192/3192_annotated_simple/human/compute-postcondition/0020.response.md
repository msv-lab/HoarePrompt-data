According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, as the range function in `xrange(1, arr1[0])` creates a sequence starting from 1 up to, but not including, `arr1[0]`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it does not directly influence the loop execution. The variable `i` is set to 1, which is not relevant for the loop since `j` will start from 1.

For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1` must be a list where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Assuming `arr1` contains at least one element, we need to ensure that `temp` is still 0 at the start. 

Therefore, the necessary conditions for the loop to execute are that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is 0**
