The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and the value at `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we are comparing `temp` with `arr1[1]`. The value of `arr1[1]` is unknown but must be an integer since it is part of a list of integers. Therefore, the value of `temp` will be updated to either remain 0 or take the value of `arr1[1]`, depending on whether `arr1[1]` is greater than 0. 

The states of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `temp` is either 0 or `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
