The expression `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` updates the value of `ans` based on the current index `i`, which is 1. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided, but the calculation will depend on them. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1, the loop is currently in its first iteration with `i` equal to 1. The values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]` will affect the calculation, but we do not have those specific values. Therefore, we can only state that `ans` is updated based on the current values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1; `ans` is updated based on the calculation (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]**
