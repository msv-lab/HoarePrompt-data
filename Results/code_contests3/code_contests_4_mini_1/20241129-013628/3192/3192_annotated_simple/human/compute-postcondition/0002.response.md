The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `n` and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0**
