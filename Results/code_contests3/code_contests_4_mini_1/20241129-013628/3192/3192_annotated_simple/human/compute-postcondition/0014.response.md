The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The variable `temp` is the maximum value among the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1. The initial values of `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` remain unchanged, but `arr` is modified to include `temp`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `arr` with the new value appended.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1.**
