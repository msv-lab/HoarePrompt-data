According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
