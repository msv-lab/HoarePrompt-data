The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is currently `arr1[1]` and `j` is 2, the value of `arr1[2]` needs to be considered for the calculation. Since the exact value of `arr1[2]` is unknown, but `arr1[0] > 1` and `arr1` is a list of integers, we can conclude:

- If `arr1[2]` is greater than `arr1[1]`, then `temp` will be updated to `arr1[2]`.
- If `arr1[2]` is less than or equal to `arr1[1]`, then `temp` remains `arr1[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]` depending on the comparison, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
