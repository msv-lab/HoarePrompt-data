The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes input data that consists of multiple companies, where each company has a description that includes a positive integer indicating the number of salaries followed by the actual salary values. The function operates under the constraints that the number of companies and salaries are limited to positive integers with specified maximum values. The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the prompt, but it can be inferred that it likely involves processing or summarizing the salary information in some way.

Given the constraints and the nature of the input, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes input data for multiple companies, each described by a number of salaries followed by the salary values, and it operates under constraints that ensure the number of companies and salaries are within specified limits.**
