According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (as stated), for the loop to execute a third time, `j` should be increased by 1, making it 3.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be 3.
- For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is either `arr1[1]` or `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
