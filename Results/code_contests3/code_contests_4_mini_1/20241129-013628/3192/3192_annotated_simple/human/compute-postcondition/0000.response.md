The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the state of `n` after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000)**
