In the given code snippet, `arr1` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input received from `raw_input()`. The function `raw_input()` accepts a string input, which is then split into separate components and converted into integers. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer; however, we do not have the specific values of the input provided, so we cannot determine the specific contents of `arr1`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1, and `n` is still a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from user input**
