The expression calculates the value to be added to `ans`, which is the result of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The variables `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine their specific values. However, we know that `n` is a positive integer and `i` is 0, indicating that this is the first iteration of a loop. 

Thus, the impact of the code is that it attempts to update `ans` based on the values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` at index `i`, which is currently 0. The exact computation for `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the values of `maxval`, `arr[0]`, and `arr2[0]`.

Since the output state does not change the values of `n` or `i`, and we acknowledge that `ans` will be updated based on the calculation, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and `ans` is updated by adding `(maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`**.
