`arr` is assigned an empty list. The value of `n` does not affect this operation, and no other variables are altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `arr` is an empty list**
