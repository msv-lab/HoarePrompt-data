`temp` is assigned the value of the maximum between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `arr1[j]` (which is `arr1[2]`) will also be an integer from the list `arr1`. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to either remain 0 or take the value of `arr1[2]`, depending on whether `arr1[2]` is greater than 0. The values of other variables remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and `arr1[2]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and `arr1[2]**
