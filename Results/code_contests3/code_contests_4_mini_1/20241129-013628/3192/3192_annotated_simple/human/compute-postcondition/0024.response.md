According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. 

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented to 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and `arr1[2]`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2.**
