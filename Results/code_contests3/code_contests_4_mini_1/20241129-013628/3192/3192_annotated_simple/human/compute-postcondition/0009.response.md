According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr1`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1` has at least 2 elements (since `arr1[0] > 1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is now `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
