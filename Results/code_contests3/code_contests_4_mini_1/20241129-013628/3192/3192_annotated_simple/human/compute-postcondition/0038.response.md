The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 3, we are comparing `temp` with `arr1[3]`. The previous value of `temp` is either `arr1[2]` or remains unchanged; however, `arr1` is a list of integers and `arr1[0]` is greater than 3, indicating `arr1` has sufficient elements. The outcome will depend on the specific values of `temp` and `arr1[3]`, but we can conclude that `temp` will take the higher of the two values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, `j` is 3.**
