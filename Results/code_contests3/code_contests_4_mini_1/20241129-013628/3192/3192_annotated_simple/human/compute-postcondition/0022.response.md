According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`, where `arr1[j]` is an element of `arr1`, and `j` is 2**
