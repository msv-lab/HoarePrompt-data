`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (0) and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. Therefore, `temp` will take the value of `arr1[2]` if it is greater than 0. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `arr1` remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State reflects that `temp` has been updated based on the values of `arr1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2**
