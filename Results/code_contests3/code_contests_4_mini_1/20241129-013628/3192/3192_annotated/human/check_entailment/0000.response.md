To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function and its logic against the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. We have `n` companies, each with a certain number of employees and their corresponding salaries.
2. The goal is to merge all companies into one while ensuring that the maximum salaries of the companies being merged are equal.
3. Salaries can only be increased, and all employees in a company must receive the same increase.
4. The task is to compute the minimal total increase of all salaries required to achieve this.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads `n`, the number of companies, and then for each company, it reads the number of employees followed by their salaries.
   
2. **Calculate Maximum Salaries:**
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum salary for each company and stores these in the list `arr`.
   
3. **Calculating the Maximum Salary Across Companies:**
   - The variable `maxval` is used to store the maximum salary found across all companies, which is crucial for determining the required increases.
   
4. **Calculating Total Increase:**
   - The program computes the total increase needed to make all companiesâ€™ maximum salaries equal to `maxval` by iterating through each company and summing the necessary increases multiplied by the number of employees.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The algorithm efficiently calculates the required increases and adheres to the merging rules as specified in the problem. 
- It ensures that the maximum salary of each company is raised to the highest maximum salary among all companies, which is the only way for them to be merged according to the problem's constraints.
- The calculations performed by the program involve finding the difference between `maxval` and each company's maximum salary, multiplied by the number of employees in that company, which aligns with minimizing the total increase.

### Conclusion:
Since the program adheres to all the specified requirements of the problem description, correctly handles the input, processes the data as required, and produces the correct output, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
