According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`. Since it is given that `arr1[0] > 1`, the loop can execute at least once because `arr1[0]` must be at least 2. 

Before the loop starts, the state indicates that `i` is 1, which does not affect the execution of the loop in this context. The value of `j` will start at 1, and since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will indeed execute.

So for the loop to execute the first time:
- `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 (which it is).
- `j` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is set to 0; for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1**.
