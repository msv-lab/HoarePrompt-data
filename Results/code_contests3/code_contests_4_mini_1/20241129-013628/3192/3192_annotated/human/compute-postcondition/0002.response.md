`maxval` is assigned the value 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `arr` is still an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.  
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
