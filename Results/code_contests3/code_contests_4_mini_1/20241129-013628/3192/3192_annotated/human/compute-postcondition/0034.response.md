`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, the value of `arr1[j]` is used in the calculation. The exact value of `temp` is not provided, nor is the value of `arr1[1]`. However, it is known that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, which implies that we are able to execute this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `temp` is updated based on the comparison with `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1; `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[1]`.**
