The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is currently 2, `arr1[j]` refers to the third element of the list `arr1`. Since `temp` is greater than 1, it will compare its current value with `arr1[2]`, which is an integer from the list. The previous values of `temp` and `arr1[j]` are not explicitly defined, but they are both greater than 1. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `temp` is updated based on the maximum value calculated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, which is greater than 1; `j` is 2.**
