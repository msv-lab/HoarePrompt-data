The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the relevant variables and the assignment made.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`; `arr2` contains the first elements from each `arr1`; `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`; `i` is `n - 1; `ans` is 0**
