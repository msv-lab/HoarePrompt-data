In the provided code snippet, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. 

Assuming `arr` is defined and has values, the variable `maxval` will take the higher value between the current value of `arr[i]` and whatever value `maxval` holds prior to this operation. 

The specific previous values of `arr[i]` and `maxval` are not provided, but `maxval` will be updated to the greater of the two values. Other variables are not affected directly by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 2; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`; `temp` is appended to `arr`; `arr2` now contains an additional element which is `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.

Output State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 2; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`; `temp` is appended to `arr`; `arr2` now contains an additional element which is `arr1[0]`; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and its previous value.**
