`temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The previous value of `temp` is 0, and `arr1[j]` is an integer greater than 1 (since `arr1[0] > 1`). Therefore, `temp` will be updated to a value greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
