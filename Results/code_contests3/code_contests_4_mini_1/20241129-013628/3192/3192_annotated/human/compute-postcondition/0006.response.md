The variable `temp` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects only the new value of `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `temp` is 0**
