To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's structure and its interactions with the variables. 

The loop iterates `n` times, where in each iteration:
- It reads a list of integers `arr1`.
- It calculates the maximum value `temp` from the elements `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.
- It appends `temp` to the list `arr`.
- It appends `arr1[0]` to the list `arr2`.
- It updates `maxval` to be the maximum of `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `arr` will contain `n` maximum values calculated from each `arr1` list.
- `arr2` will contain `n` values where each value corresponds to `arr1[0]` from each iteration.
- `maxval` will represent the maximum value found in the `arr` list after all iterations.
- The current index `i` will be equal to `n - 1` after the final iteration.
- Each `arr1` processed will have `arr1[0]` values greater than or equal to 2, ensuring `temp` is always computed from at least one valid element.

Thus, the output state summarizes as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum values from each `arr1`, `arr2` contains the first elements from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, `i` is `n - 1`.**
