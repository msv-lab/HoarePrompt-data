According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` becoming 2. The loop can continue as long as \( n \) is greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and its previous value, `arr2` contains the previous values plus `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
