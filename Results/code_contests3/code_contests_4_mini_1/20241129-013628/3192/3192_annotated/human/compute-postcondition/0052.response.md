Output State: **`ans` is the sum of (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i] for all i in range(n), `i` is n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` contains maximum values, `arr2` contains first elements from each `arr1`, `maxval` is the maximum value in `arr`, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
