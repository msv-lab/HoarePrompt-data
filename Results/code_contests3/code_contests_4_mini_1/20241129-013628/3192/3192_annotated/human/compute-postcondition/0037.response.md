According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 3, and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 3; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 3**
