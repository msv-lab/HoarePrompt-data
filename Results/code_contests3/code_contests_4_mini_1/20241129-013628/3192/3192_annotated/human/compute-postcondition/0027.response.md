Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] and `temp` is appended to `arr`.**
