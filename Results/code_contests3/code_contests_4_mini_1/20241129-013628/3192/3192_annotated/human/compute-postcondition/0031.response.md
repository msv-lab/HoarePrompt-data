The code initializes `arr1` by taking input from the user and converting it into a list of integers. The initial state indicates that `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`, `maxval` is updated based on the values in `arr`, and `arr2` contains previous values modified by `arr1[0]`. The variable `i` is 2, which means the loop is prepared to execute a second time, with the condition that `n` must be greater than 2.

Since `arr1` is being assigned values from user input, its contents will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `arr1` has been updated with the list of integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers based on user input; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`, `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and its previous value, `arr2` contains the previous values plus `arr1[0]`, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
