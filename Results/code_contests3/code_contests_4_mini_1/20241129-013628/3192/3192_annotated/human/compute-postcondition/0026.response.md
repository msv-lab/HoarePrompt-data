The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, updating `temp` to the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. After all iterations of the loop have finished executing, `temp` will contain the maximum value among all the elements in `arr1` excluding the first element (i.e., `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.**
