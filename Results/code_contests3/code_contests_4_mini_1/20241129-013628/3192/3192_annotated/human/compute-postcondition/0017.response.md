According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

After the next iteration, `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `n`, which it will be since `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`, `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`**
