The variable `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[2]`. The exact impact depends on the value of `arr1[2]` and the current value of `temp`, but since `arr1[0] > 2`, we know that `arr1` has at least three elements. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[2]`**
