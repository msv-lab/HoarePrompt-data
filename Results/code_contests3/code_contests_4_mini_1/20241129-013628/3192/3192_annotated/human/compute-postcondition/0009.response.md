According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `arr1`. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `arr1[0] - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0] > 1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`, `temp` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
