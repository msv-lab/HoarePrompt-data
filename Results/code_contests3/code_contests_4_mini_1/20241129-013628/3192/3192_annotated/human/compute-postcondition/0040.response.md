The code appends the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. Given that `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, this operation does not affect any other variables. Thus, the output state will reflect the addition of `temp` to `arr`.

Output State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 2; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`; `temp` is appended to `arr`.**
