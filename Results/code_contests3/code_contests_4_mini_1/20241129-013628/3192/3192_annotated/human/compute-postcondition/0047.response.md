According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0] to its previous value; `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
