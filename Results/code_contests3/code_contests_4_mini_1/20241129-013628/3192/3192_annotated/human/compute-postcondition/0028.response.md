The value of `arr2` is affected by appending the value `arr1[0]` to it. Since `arr1[0]` is specified to be greater than 1, `arr2` will now contain an additional value equal to `arr1[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`; `arr2` contains the previous values plus `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`; `arr2` contains the previous values plus `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]**
