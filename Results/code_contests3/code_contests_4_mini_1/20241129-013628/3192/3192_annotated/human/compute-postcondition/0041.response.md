The value of `arr1[0]` is appended to `arr2`, which means that `arr2` will now include the length of `arr1`. The previous values of the variables `arr1` and `arr2` are not specified, but we know that `arr1` contains integers, and `arr1[0]` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr2` will now have an additional element corresponding to the value of `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 2; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`; `temp` is appended to `arr`; `arr2` now contains an additional element which is `arr1[0]`.**
