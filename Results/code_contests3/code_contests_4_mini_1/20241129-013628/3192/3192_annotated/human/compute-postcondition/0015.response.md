`arr2` is modified by appending the value of `arr1[0]` to it. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (as specified in the initial state), `arr2` will now contain at least one element, which is the value of `arr1[0]`. Other variables (`n`, `maxval`, `i`, `arr`, `temp`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]**
