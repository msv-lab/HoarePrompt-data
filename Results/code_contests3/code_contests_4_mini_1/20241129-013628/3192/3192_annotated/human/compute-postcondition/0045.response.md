According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is set to `n - 1` before the loop starts, but it will be overwritten by the loop's control variable as the loop begins execution. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that:
- `n` is at least 1 (which it is, based on the provided state).
- The initial value of `i` will be set to 0 when the loop starts.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be set to 0 when the loop starts executing. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
