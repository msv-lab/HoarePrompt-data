According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2. For the loop to execute a third time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1] to its previous value; `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.**
