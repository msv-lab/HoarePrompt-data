The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`. During each iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. After all iterations have completed, `temp` will hold the maximum value from the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`.

Given that `arr1` contains integers and that `arr1[0] > 1`, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times. 

After the loop finishes executing:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `arr` is still an empty list.
- `maxval` remains 0.
- `arr2` is still an empty list.
- `i` is still 0.
- `arr1` is unchanged and contains integers with `arr1[0] > 1`.
- `temp` will be the maximum value found in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.
  
Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.**
