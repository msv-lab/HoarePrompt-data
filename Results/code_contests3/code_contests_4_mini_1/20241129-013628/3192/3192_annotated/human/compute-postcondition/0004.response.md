According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer with the constraint 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `arr` is an empty list, which does not affect the loop execution. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0, and since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, we can conclude that it meets the requirement for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
