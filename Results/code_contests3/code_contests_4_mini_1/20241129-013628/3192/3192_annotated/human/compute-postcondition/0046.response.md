The variable `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The specific values of `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]` are not provided, but we know that `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Thus, we can infer that `arr[0]` and `arr2[0]` will be used in the calculation. The previous value of `ans` is not given, but it will be updated by the calculated value.

Since the exact values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are unknown, we can only state that `ans` will be updated based on these variables. 

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0] to its previous value; `i` is 0.**
