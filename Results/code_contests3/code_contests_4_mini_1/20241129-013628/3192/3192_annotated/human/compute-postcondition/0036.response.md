The variable `temp` is updated with the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. The exact value of `arr1[2]` is not specified, but `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. Since `temp` is updated based on the comparison, the output state will include the new value of `temp` relative to its previous value and `arr1[2]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 2.**
