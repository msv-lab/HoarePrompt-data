The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[j]`. The value of `j` is 3, so `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[3]`. As `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute a fourth time, we can assume that `arr1` has at least 4 elements and `arr1[3]` is valid. However, the exact value of `arr1[3]` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `temp` is updated, but we cannot determine the specific new value without knowing `arr1[3]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 3.**
