In this case, `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`. The variable `arr` contains a maximum value `temp`, indicating that `arr[i]` must be less than or equal to `temp`. The previous value of `maxval` is not specified, but it is being compared with `arr[i]`. Therefore, the output will reflect that `maxval` is updated based on this comparison.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is updated to be the maximum value between `arr[i]` and its previous value; `arr2` contains the previous values plus `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]**
