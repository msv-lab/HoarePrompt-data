According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `arr1[0]`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. Given that `i` is 2 in the state before the loop and `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute a second time, we can conclude that `arr1[0]` also needs to be adjusted based on this information.

For the loop to execute the first time:
1. `arr1[0]` needs to be greater than 1.
2. `j` will start at 1.

Since `temp` is currently 0, it will not affect the execution of the loop as it is not used in the loop header. 

State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 1, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1**
