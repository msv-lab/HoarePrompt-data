According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[2]`, which is greater than 1; `j` is 3; for the loop to execute a fourth time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
