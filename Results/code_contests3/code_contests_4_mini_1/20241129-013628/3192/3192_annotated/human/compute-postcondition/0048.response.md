The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` to its previous value. The current value of `i` is 1, so the expression involves `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]`. Since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, we can assume `arr` and `arr2` both have at least 2 elements. The values of `maxval`, `arr[1]`, and `arr2[1]` are not specified, so we cannot calculate a specific numeric output for `ans`. However, we can express the change in terms of the variables involved.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1] to its previous value; `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
