According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and since `j` starts at 1, we need to increment `j` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be increased by 1 and must be less than `arr1[0]`. Thus, if `j` was 1 in the last iteration, it will now be 2, and `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[1]`, and `j` is 2.**
