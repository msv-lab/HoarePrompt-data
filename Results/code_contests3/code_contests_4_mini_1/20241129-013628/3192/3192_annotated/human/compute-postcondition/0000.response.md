The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `n` are not specified but are constrained to be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
