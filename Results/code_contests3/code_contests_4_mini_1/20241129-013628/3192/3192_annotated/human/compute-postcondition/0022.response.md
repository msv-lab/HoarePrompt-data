According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1`. The loop iterates starting from `j = 1` and continues while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, meaning `arr1[0]` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue executing. 

To execute the loop for a second time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval`; `arr2` contains the value of `arr1[0]`; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is set to max(0, arr1[1]) when `j` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 and `j` is 2**.
