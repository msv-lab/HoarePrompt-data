`arr` is an empty list and `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. After executing the code, `temp` will be appended to `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum value `temp`; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with `arr1[0] > 1`; `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]**
