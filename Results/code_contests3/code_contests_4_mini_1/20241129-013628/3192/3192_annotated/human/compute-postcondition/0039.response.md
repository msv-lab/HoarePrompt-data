The loop iterates over the elements of `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. It updates `temp` to be the maximum value found among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, the loop will execute at least once; if `arr1[0]` is 2, it will execute twice, and so on.

After all iterations of the loop have completed, `temp` will contain the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. The value of `j` will be equal to `arr1[0]`, which indicates the upper limit of the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop are complete is as follows:

Output State: **`arr1` contains integers with `arr1[0]` greater than or equal to 2; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`; `j` is equal to `arr1[0]`.**
