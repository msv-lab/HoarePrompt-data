The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. Instead, it processes a set of constraints where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of companies, and each company has a positive integer `m_i` representing the number of employees. The salaries of these employees are also provided, with each salary being a positive integer that does not exceed 10^9. The total number of employees across all companies does not exceed 200,000.

Based on the output specification, the function will likely analyze the salary data from the provided companies and return some form of result based on that data, but the exact nature of the output is not specified here.

Functionality: **The function processes data related to multiple companies and their employees' salaries but does not accept parameters directly. The specific return value or analysis based on the salary data is not detailed.**
