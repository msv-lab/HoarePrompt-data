The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` (input as a string), checks if `n` is not divisible by 10, and initializes `s` to 1 if true (or 0 otherwise). It then prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`. The function, however, does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values) and assumes `n` will always be a valid non-negative integer as per the given constraints.
