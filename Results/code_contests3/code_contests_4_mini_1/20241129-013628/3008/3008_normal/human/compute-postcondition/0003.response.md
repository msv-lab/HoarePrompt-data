The value of `s` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `s` was 0, and now it has changed to 1. The variable `n` remains unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `s` is 1**
