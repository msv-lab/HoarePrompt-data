The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts an input from the user. The value of `n` can be any non-negative integer within the range of 0 to \(10^{18}\). Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^{18}\).

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18**
