`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts user input as a string. The initial state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer in the range from 0 to \(10^{18}\), but after the execution of the code, `n` will now be a string representation of the input value. Thus, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the user input value**
