The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on a non-negative integer `n` that is constrained such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. However, since there are no explicit parameters to the function, the specific output or behavior based on the value of `n` is not provided in the given information. Therefore, without further details about how `n` is utilized or what output is generated based on `n`, the functionality cannot be precisely defined.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified in the provided information.**
