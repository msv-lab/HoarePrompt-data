The value of `s` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `s` was 0, and now it is updated to 1. The variable `n` is unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of the user input value, `s` is 1, and the last digit of the integer value of `n` is not 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the user input value, `s` is 1, and the last digit of the integer value of `n` is not 0**
