The function accepts no parameters, reads a non-negative integer `n` from user input, and prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`, where `s` is set to 1 if the last digit of `n` is not 0, or 0 if it is. However, since `n` is treated as a string and is used in a division operation, this may lead to a TypeError unless `n` is first converted to an integer. If the input is invalid (e.g., not a numeric string), it will raise an error. Additionally, the function does not handle inputs outside the specified range of 0 to 10^18.
