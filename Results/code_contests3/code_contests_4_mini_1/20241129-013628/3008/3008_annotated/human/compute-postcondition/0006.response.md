The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. However, since there are no input parameters specified in the function definition, we cannot determine the output based on any input values. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of input-output relationships. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified.**
