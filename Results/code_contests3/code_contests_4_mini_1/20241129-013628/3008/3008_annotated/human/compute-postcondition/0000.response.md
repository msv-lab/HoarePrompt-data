The value of `n` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts a user input. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and can take any value within the specified range, the output state reflects that `n` now holds the input value, whatever that may be. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18**
