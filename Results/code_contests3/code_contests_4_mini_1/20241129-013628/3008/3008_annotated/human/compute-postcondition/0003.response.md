The value of `s` is assigned the value 1. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and since `s` is being updated, the output state will reflect this change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `n` is not divisible by 10; `s` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and `n` is not divisible by 10; `s` is 1**
