The function accepts no parameters and reads a non-negative integer `n` from input. It calculates and prints the result of the expression `2 * (n / 10) + s`, where `s` is set to 1 if `n` is not divisible by 10, otherwise `s` is 0. If `n` is 0, the output will be 0. However, the function does not handle invalid input (e.g., non-integer inputs) and relies on `input()` which returns a string, potentially leading to a TypeError when performing arithmetic operations.
