The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input without any validation. While the problem states that `n` is a non-negative integer, the program does not handle cases where the input might not be an integer, leading to potential errors.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program calculates `s`, which is set to 1 if `n` is not divisible by 10. However, this logic does not account for the correct number of operations needed to reduce `n` to zero according to the problem's requirements.
   - The expression `2 * (n / 10) + s` does not represent the minimum number of subtractions required. The way the program calculates the number of operations is incorrect. For example, if `n` is 24, the correct operations should be detailed and counted through a systematic process (subtracting digits) rather than this arbitrary formula.

3. **Output**: The output is not guaranteed to be the minimum number of operations to reach zero, as required by the problem description. For instance, for `n = 24`, the correct output should be `5`, while the program would output `5` if calculated in a specific way, but it does not generalize correctly.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum number of operations as described in the problem statement. Instead, it uses a flawed mathematical expression that does not accurately reflect the task.
- Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
