#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the result of the calculation math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)) for the odd integer n in the range of 3 to 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199 and returns the result of the calculation `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. However, it does not handle potential division by zero errors that could occur if `n` results in `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` being zero. Therefore, the function's behavior is undefined if `n` leads to a zero denominator, which is a critical edge case that is not addressed in the annotations.
