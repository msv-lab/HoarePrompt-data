The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum size of a square that can embed a 2n-gon (which has 2n vertices) for odd integers n in the range of 3 to 199.
   - The output must be a real number that meets the precision requirement of having an absolute or relative error not exceeding \(10^{-6}\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. 
   - This computation is not aligned with the requirements to find the minimum size of the square that can enclose the 2n-gon.
   - The formulas used in the function do not correspond to the geometric properties necessary to compute the size of the embedding square.

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - The comment notes that the function does not handle cases where `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` could be zero. However, for odd integers n between 3 and 199, this situation should not occur, but the function's logic is still fundamentally flawed as it does not produce the required output related to the square size.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function fails to provide the correct computation as outlined in the problem description. Instead of calculating the minimum size of the square, it returns a calculation that does not relate to the problem requirements.

Therefore, based on the above analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
