Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to calculate the minimum side length of a square that can embed a 2n-gon based on the formula given in the function `func_1`. However, the formula used in the program does not correctly correspond to the requirements of the problem statement. 

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Polygon Type**: The problem states that the input is an odd integer `n` which corresponds to a 2n-gon (a polygon with 2n vertices). The program correctly reads `n` as input, but the formula used does not seem to consider the properties of a 2n-gon correctly.
   
2. **Mathematical Formula**: The formula `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` is not a known or derived formula for finding the side length of the square required to embed a 2n-gon. The correct computation for such an embedding generally involves considering both the radius of the circumcircle and the properties of the polygon involved. The program lacks the correct geometric derivations, especially considering that n is odd and thus 2n-gon must be treated differently compared to an n-gon.

3. **Potential Input Case**: If we take the case where `n = 3`, the expected output according to the problem statement is approximately `1.931851653`. The program's output might not yield this value correctly. Given that the formula is incorrect, it will fail to produce valid outputs for other odd integers as well, such as `n = 5` or `n = 199`.

As a result of the issues highlighted, particularly the incorrect mathematical formulation, the program cannot be considered correct in all cases specified by the problem statement. Hence, it is deemed incorrect.
