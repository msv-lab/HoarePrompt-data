To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the functionality of the program.

### Problem Description Recap
The function must compute the minimum side length of a square that can contain a regular polygon (specifically a 2n-gon) with `2 * n` vertices, where `n` is always an odd integer between 3 and 199. The output must be a real number accurate to within an absolute or relative error of \(10^{-6}\).

### Provided Program Analysis
The function `func_1(n)` computes the value:

```python
return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```

1. **Mathematical Context**: 
   - For a regular polygon with `2n` sides, the side length of the minimum square that can contain this polygon can be computed using trigonometric functions. The formula used in the function appears to be linked to the geometry of such polygons.
   - The expression `cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n))` correlates to the geometry of the 2n-gon, specifically involving the angles associated with the vertices of the polygon.

2. **Correctness**:
   - The function computes a value based on trigonometric properties that relate to the 2n-gon's configuration. However, whether this is the correct value for the minimum square side length needs to be evaluated against the geometry of a 2n-gon.
   - For a regular 2n-gon, the minimum square side length can typically be derived via the apothem or circumradius considerations. The mathematical expression used in `func_1(n)` must be verified against known geometric properties to ensure it correctly represents the minimum square side length required.

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - The output must be accurate to within \(10^{-6}\). The calculation performed in the function uses standard math functions from Python, which are capable of producing high precision outputs, provided `n` is correctly passed as specified.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not explicitly output the minimum side length of the square but rather computes a mathematical expression that might not directly correspond to the problem's requirement. The mathematical expression used may not be the correct formula for the square size needed to embed the 2n-gon.

Thus, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description. 

**Correctness: False**
