The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199. After executing the function body, it returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an odd integer `n` within the specified range and return the result of the mathematical expression involving cosine and sine functions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is an odd integer in the range of 3 to 199, and returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)).**
