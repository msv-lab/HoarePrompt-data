The function accepts a positive odd integer `n` in the range 3 to 199 and returns the result of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or if `n` is not an odd integer, but these cases are guaranteed not to occur based on the provided precondition.
