To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the square of the minimum size such that a 2n-gon can be embedded in the square. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an odd integer n between 3 and 199. The output should be the minimum side length of the square for each test case.

### Program Analysis:
```python
import math
for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
for ca in xrange(int(raw_input())):
    n = int(raw_input())
    print('%.9f' % func_1(n))
```

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(n)` computes the ratio of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` to `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. This is intended to calculate the minimum side length of the square that can contain the 2n-gon.
   
2. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer T (number of test cases) and then reads n for each test case. The expected input for n is confirmed to be an odd integer in the range [3, 199], which the code does not explicitly check but is guaranteed by the problem statement.

3. **Output Format**: The output is formatted to 9 decimal places, which is appropriate according to the problem requirements regarding precision.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a positive odd integer `n` within the specified range and gives the result of the formula. It also mentions that the function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or if `n` is not an odd integer, but these cases are guaranteed by the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not include any checks for invalid input, but since the problem guarantees that n will always be an odd integer within the specified range, this is acceptable.
- The formula used appears mathematically sound for the values given, and it aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly implements the calculation as specified in the problem description, handles the expected input range properly, and formats the output as required, I find no edge cases that would cause the program to fail under prescribed conditions.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code calculates the side length of the square that can contain a 2n-gon using the given mathematical formula, which is appropriate for all specified test cases within the defined input range.
