Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute the coins. 

Here's the analysis of why the program is incorrect:

1. The program contains a hardcoded condition that checks if `n == 11`, and prints `5` in that specific case. This is arbitrary and not part of the general logic required to solve the problem. It does not account for any other cases where `n` could be any number between 1 and 100.

2. The logic to count occurrences of each coin value works correctly, as it uses an array `c` of size 101 to count how many times each value appears. However, the final output is the maximum value in this count array (`max(c)`), which represents the highest count of any single coin value. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of pockets needed.

For example, the input:
```
6
1 2 2 3 3 4
```
In this case, the counts would be:
- `1`: 1 time
- `2`: 2 times
- `3`: 2 times
- `4`: 1 time

The maximum count is `2`, which suggests that at least `2` pockets are needed, but the actual distribution could be:
- Pocket 1: [1, 2, 3]
- Pocket 2: [2, 3, 4]

The program mistakenly assumes that the maximum count of any individual coin value directly translates to the number of pockets needed, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program fails to handle various cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
