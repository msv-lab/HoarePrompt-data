Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to determine the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute coins such that no two coins with the same value are placed in the same pocket. However, it contains a significant issue:

1. The conditional check `if n == 11: print(5)` is an arbitrary case that does not follow the general logic of the problem. It hardcodes a response for a specific input (n=11), which is not applicable to the general problem.

2. The program counts the occurrences of each coin value in the list `c`, where `c[d]` is incremented for each coin value `d` in the input list. The code then prints the maximum value in `c`, which represents the highest count of any coin value. This value does not accurately represent the minimum number of pockets needed. For instance, if the input is `1 1 1`, the output will be `3`, suggesting that 3 pockets are needed for three coins of the same value, which is correct. However, if the input includes multiple different values, the logic fails to account for the distribution of coins.

Example input that demonstrates the failure:
- Input: `4` and `1 1 2 2`
- The expected output is `2` because we can use two pockets: one for `1` and `2` and another one for the second `1` and `2`. However, the program would incorrectly output `2`, which is the maximum count of `1`s or `2`s, but doesn't reflect the necessary pockets.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem for all possible inputs.
