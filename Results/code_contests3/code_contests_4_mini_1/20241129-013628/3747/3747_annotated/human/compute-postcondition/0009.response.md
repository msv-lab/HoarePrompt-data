The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the second element of the list `a`. Since `c` was initialized to 0 and `c[d]` was already set to 1, after executing `c[d] += 1`, the value of `c[d]` becomes 2. The other variables' states are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 2 integers; `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` now being 2; `d` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 2 integers; `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` now being 2; `d` is the second element of `a.**
