The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `n` is assigned an input integer.**
