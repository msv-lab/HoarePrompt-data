The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. Since the function does not return any specified output in the provided details, we cannot determine its return value based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters in its definition, but operates under constraints where n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). The return value is not specified.**
