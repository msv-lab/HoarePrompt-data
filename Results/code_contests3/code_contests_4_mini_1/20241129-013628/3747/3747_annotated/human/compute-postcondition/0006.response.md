According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` contains at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, it ensures that `a` will have at least one element. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the states `d` will take the value of the first element in `a`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0, `d` is the first element of `a`.**
