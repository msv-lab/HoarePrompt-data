The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The variable `d` is the first element of the list `a`, and since `c` is initialized to a list of 101 integers all set to 0, after this operation, `c[d]` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0, with `c[d]` now being 1; `d` is the first element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0, with `c[d]` now being 1; `d` is the first element of `a**.
