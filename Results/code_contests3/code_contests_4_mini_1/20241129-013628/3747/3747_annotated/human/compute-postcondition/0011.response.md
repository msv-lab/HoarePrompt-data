`c[d]` is incremented by 1. The variable `d` is the third element of the list `a`, which is an integer and is guaranteed to be within the range of 0 to 100 due to the constraints of `c`. Since `c[d]` was initially 2, after execution, `c[d]` will be 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 integers; `c[d]` is now 3; `d` is the third element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 integers; `c[d]` is now 3; `d` is the third element of `a.**
