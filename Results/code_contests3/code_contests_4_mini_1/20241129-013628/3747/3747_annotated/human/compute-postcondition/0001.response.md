The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input().split()`. This means that the input will be split into separate strings, each representing an integer, and then converted into integers to form the list `a`. The specific values of the integers in the list will depend on the input provided, but they will all fall within the range of 1 to 100.

Since `n` is an integer that determines the number of elements in the list `a`, and it is guaranteed that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`, the output state will reflect the fact that `a` now consists of `n` integers, all of which are within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100**
