The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The previous state of `n` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Thus, the variables `n` and `a` retain their previous values, and the new variable `c` is created. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0.**
