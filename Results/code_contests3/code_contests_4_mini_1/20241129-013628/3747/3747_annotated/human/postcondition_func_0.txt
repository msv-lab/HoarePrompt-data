The function accepts an integer input `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It prints 5 if `n` equals 11, and then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`, printing the maximum count of any integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a`. The function does not return any value.
