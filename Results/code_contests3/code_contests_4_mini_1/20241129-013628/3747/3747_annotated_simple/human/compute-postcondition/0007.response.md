The variable `d` is the first element of the list `a`, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `d` is an integer that corresponds to an index in `c`, `c[d]` will be increased by 1. The values of the other variables `n`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged, but now `c[d]` has been updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is the first element of `a`, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is the first element of `a`, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1.**
