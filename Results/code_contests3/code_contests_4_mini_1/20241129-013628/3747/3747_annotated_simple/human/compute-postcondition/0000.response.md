The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is specified to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, the output state will reflect that `n` is now an input integer within that range. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a[i] satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.**
