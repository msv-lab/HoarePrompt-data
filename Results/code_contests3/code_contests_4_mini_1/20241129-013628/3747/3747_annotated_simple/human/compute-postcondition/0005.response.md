The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the previous state of `n` or `a`. Since `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100 and is not directly impacted by this line of code, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `a`, while also indicating the initialization of the list `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers based on the input from raw_input(); `c` is a list of 101 zeros.**
