The function `func` does not have any explicitly defined parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the constraints mentioned, it is implied that the function will work with an integer `n` and a list `a` that contains `n` integers. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer in the list `a` satisfies 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100.

Since the output of the function is not specified, we cannot determine what the function returns. Therefore, we can only describe the input parameters based on the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer a[i] (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100) is within the specified range. The return value is not specified.**
