According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `a`. The loop will execute if the list `a` contains at least 1 element. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, it implies that `a` must have at least one integer based on the input. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-empty list of integers with `n` being at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, `d` will take on the value of the first element in `a`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, `a` must contain integers, and thus the first value of `d` will be `a[0]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is the first element of `a`**
