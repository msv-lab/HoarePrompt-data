The code assigns a new value to the variable `a`, which is a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input provided by `raw_input()`. The input consists of `n` integers. The previous state of `a` is undefined, but it will now contain the integers provided as input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list of n integers based on the input from raw_input()**
