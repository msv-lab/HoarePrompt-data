The variable `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the third element of the list `a`, which is an integer. The output state reflects that the value of `c[d]` has been modified, while `n`, `a`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `a`, and `c[d]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 3 elements, `d` is the third element of `a`, `c[d]` is incremented by 1.**
