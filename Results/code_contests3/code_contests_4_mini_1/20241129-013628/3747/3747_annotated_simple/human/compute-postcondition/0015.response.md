Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). It prints `5` if `n` equals `11`. Then, it counts the occurrences of each integer from `1` to `100` in the list `a`, storing the results in a count list `c`. Finally, it prints the maximum frequency of any integer in the list `a`. The function does not return any value. **
