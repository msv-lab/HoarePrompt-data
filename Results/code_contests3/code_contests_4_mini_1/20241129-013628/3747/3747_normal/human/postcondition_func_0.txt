The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and prints the maximum count of any integer in the list. If there are no integers in `a`, the maximum count will be 0. The function does not handle cases where the input may not meet the specified constraints, such as when `a` is empty or contains values outside the specified range.
