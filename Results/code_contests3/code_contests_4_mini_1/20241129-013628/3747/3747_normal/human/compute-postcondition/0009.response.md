The value of `d` is the second element of `a`, and `c[d]` is the element in `c` at index `d`. The code `c[d] += 1` increments the value at index `d` in `c` by 1. The previous state of `c` is affected since one of its elements is increased by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `c` has the element at index `d` increased by 1, `d` is the second element of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is an iterable with at least 2 elements, `c` has the element at index `d` increased by 1, `d` is the second element of `a**
