The variable `n` is assigned a new integer value from input, which means that it will no longer hold its previous value but will be updated. The list `a` is then assigned the result of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which takes the input from the user, splits it into a sequence of strings, converts each string to an integer, and creates a list of these integers. The previous values of `a` are therefore not retained. 

The output state will reflect the new value of `n` (which is now an input integer) and the new list `a` containing the integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer; `a` is a list of integers from input.**
