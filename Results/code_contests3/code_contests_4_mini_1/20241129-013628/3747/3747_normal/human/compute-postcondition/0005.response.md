The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this operation, and there are no changes or actions taken regarding `n` or `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer; `a` remains unchanged; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `a` remains unchanged; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.**
