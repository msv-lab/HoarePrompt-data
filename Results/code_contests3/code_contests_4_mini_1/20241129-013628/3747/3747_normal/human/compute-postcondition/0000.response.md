`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is unspecified but is within the range of 1 to 100. The list `a` remains unaffected by this line. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, and `n` is now assigned a new integer value from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100, and `n` is now assigned a new integer value from input.**
