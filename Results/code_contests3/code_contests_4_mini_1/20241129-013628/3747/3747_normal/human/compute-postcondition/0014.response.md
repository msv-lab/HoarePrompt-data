The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters, but it operates based on the constraints provided. The function is expected to work with a variable `n`, which is an integer satisfying the condition \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and a variable `a`, which is a list of `n` integers, where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 100\).

Given the output conditions, the function will likely return a result based on the values of `n` and the list `a`, but without specific output conditions provided, we cannot detail them. However, it is clear that the function will utilize these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
