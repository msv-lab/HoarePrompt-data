To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze each part step-by-step.

### Problem Description
The task is to determine the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute coins such that no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket. The input consists of the number of coins, and their respective values.

### Program Analysis
The program reads an integer `n` (the number of coins) and a list of integers `a` (the values of the coins). It counts the occurrences of each coin value using an array `c` of size 101 (to account for values from 1 to 100). Finally, it prints the maximum count from this array.

### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **Input of Size 1**: The case where `n = 1` should return 1 as there is only one coin.
2. **All Coins Unique**: If all coins have different values, the output should also be 1.
3. **All Coins Same Value**: If all coins are of the same value, then the output should be equal to the total number of coins, `n`.
4. **Case of `n = 11`**: The program has a specific case for when `n = 11`, printing 5 directly, which seems arbitrary and not aligned with the problem description.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints indicate that the program counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and prints the maximum count. However, it also mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input might not meet the constraints, such as when `a` is empty or contains values outside the specified range. 

### Conclusion
The program's logic for counting occurrences is sound, but the explicit handling for `n == 11` suggests that the program is hardcoded for a specific case that doesn't follow the general rule laid out in the problem description. Consequently, this can lead to incorrect outputs for the input set when `n` is 11, or potentially other inputs that it doesn't cover.

Thus, since the program does not necessarily produce the correct result for all potential cases, including the edge case mentioned, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically the case of `n = 11`.
