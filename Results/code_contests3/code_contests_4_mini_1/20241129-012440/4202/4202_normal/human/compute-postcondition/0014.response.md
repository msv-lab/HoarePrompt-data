The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` can be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the count of '1's in the input string. The value of `pa` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `pb`, which can be either 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on the condition.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether `i` is '1' or not.**
