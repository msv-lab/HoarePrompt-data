The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '1'. The previous value of `pb` is 0, and the value of `i` is the first character of the input string. If the first character `i` is '1', then `pb` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character, `i` is the first character of the input string.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character, `i` is the first character of the input string.**
