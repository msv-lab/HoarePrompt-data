The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to the string '1'. The current value of `pa` can either be 0 or 1, depending on its previous state. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pa` will be increased by 1 (resulting in a value of either 1 or 2). If `i` is not '1', `pa` remains unchanged. As such, the output state reflects the possible values of `pa` and the condition of `i`.

Output State: **`pa` is either 0 or 1; if `i` is '1', then `pa` is either 1 or 2; if `i` is not '1', then `pa` remains the same.**
