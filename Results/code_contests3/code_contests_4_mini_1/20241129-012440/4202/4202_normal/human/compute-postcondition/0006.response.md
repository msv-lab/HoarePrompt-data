The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to the string '1'. The previous value of `pa` can be either 0, 1, or 2. Depending on the value of `i`, `pa` may become 0, 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either 0, 1, or 2; `i` is an input string which determines if `pa` increases by 1.

Output State: **`pa` is either 0, 1, or 2; `i` is an input string which determines if `pa` increases by 1**
