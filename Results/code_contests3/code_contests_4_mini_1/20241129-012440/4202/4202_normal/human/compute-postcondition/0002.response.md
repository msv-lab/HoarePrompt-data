Since the input `i` will be the first character of the input from `raw_input()`, it will determine whether `pa` is incremented. If `i` is equal to '1', then `pa` will be incremented by 1. 

The initial value of `pa` is 0. If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1. If `i` is not '1', then `pa` remains 0.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `i`. The output state is: `pa` is either 0 or 1 based on whether `i` is '1' or not.

Output State: **`pa` is either 0 or 1**
