`pa` and `pb` are both counts of '1's in the input string. The code prints 'YES' if `pa` is greater than or equal to `pb`, and 'NO' otherwise. The output will depend on the values of `pa` and `pb`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is also the count of '1's in the input string; the output printed is 'YES' if `pa >= pb`, otherwise 'NO'.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is also the count of '1's in the input string; the output printed is 'YES' if `pa >= pb`, otherwise 'NO'.**
