The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is equal to '1'. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` will be 1 (if it was 0) or remain 2 (if it was 1). If `i` is not '1', `pb` will remain unchanged. The value of `pa` is not affected. Hence, the output state considers both possibilities for `pb`.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`; `i` is the next character of the input string.**
