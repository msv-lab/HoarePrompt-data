The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are 01-strings, meaning they are strings containing only the characters "0" and "1". The lengths of these strings can range from 1 to 1000 characters. The function processes these strings and outputs a result based on their content. However, the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two 01-strings, `a` and `b`, with lengths ranging from 1 to 1000. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are 01-strings (strings containing only "0" and "1") with lengths ranging from 1 to 1000.**
