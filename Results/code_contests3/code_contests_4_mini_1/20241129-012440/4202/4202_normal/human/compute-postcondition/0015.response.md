The loop counts the number of '1's in the input string and keeps track of the count in `pb`. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `pb` will be equal to the total count of '1's in the input string, while `pa` will remain the initial count of '1's in the input string. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `pa` and `pb` will retain their initial values.

Output State: **`pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is also the count of '1's in the input string.**
