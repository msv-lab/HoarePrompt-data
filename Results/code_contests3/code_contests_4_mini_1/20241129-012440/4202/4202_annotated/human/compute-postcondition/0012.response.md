The variable `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1', otherwise it remains the same if `i` is '0'. Since `pb` is initially either 0 or 1 depending on the input character `i`, if `i` is '1', then `pb` increases by 1. If `i` is '0', `pb` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `i` is the new character read from input, `pb` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1' or remains as 0 or 1 if `i` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `i` is the new character read from input, `pb` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1' or remains as 0 or 1 if `i` is '0'**
