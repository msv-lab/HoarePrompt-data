Functionality: ** The function accepts two binary strings (01-strings) as input from the user. It counts the number of '1's in each string and compares these counts. The function prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to that in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Note that the function does not explicitly check for input validity or handle cases where the input strings are empty, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
