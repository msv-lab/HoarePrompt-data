The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are 01-strings, meaning they can only contain the characters "0" and "1". The lengths of both strings are between 1 and 1000 characters. The function processes these strings and returns a result based on their content. However, without specific output cases given in the prompt, we cannot detail the exact nature of the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two 01-strings, `a` and `b`, with lengths between 1 and 1000. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are 01-strings with lengths between 1 and 1000.**
