The expression `pb += i == '1'` checks whether `i` is equal to '1'. If it is, the result of the comparison (`True`, which is equivalent to 1) is added to the current value of `pb`. If `i` is '0', the result of the comparison is `False` (equivalent to 0), and `pb` remains unchanged. 

Given that `pb` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', or remains as 0 or 1 if `i` is '0', the output state can be summarized based on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is '1', `pb` will increase by 1 (resulting in either 2 or 3). If `i` is '0', `pb` remains unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is:
- If `i` is '1': `a` is a non-empty 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `i` is '1', `pb` is either 2 or 3.
- If `i` is '0': `a` is a non-empty 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `i` is '0', `pb` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `i` is either '0' or '1', `pb` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged based on the value of `i`.**
