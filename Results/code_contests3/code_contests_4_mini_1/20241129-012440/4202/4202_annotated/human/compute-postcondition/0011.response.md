According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input being read from `raw_input()`. Since `a` is a non-empty 01-string at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop has processed the last character of `a`. 

Given that `i` is the last character of `a`, for the loop to execute one more time, a new character must be provided as input. The for loop will read each character from the input. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, we need a new character, which will also affect the value of `pb` based on whether the new character is '1' or '0'. 

Thus, if we assume that `a` remains unchanged and a new character is read, `pb` will depend on the new character. 

State: **`a` is a non-empty 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `i` is the new character read from input, `pb` is 1 if `i` is '1' or `pb` is 0 if `i` is '0'**
