The loop counts the number of '1's in the input string provided through `raw_input()`. The variable `pa` increments by 1 for each '1' encountered in the input string. 

If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and `pa` remains 0. If the input string contains characters, `pa` will equal the total count of '1's in that string.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be that `pa` is the total number of '1's in the input string, and `i` will have taken each character from the input string during the iterations.

Output State: **`a` is a 01-string, `b` is a 01-string, `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the last character of the input string or undefined if the input is empty.**
