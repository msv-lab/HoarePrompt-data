To determine the output state, we evaluate the provided code snippet. The variable `pa` is initially `0`. The expression `i == '1'` checks if the character `i` (the first character of the input string) is equal to the string `'1'`. If it is true, `pa` is incremented by `1`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

1. If `i` is `'1'`, then `pa` becomes `1` (since `0 + 1 = 1`).
2. If `i` is any character other than `'1'`, then `pa` remains `0`.

Since we are not provided with the actual input string, we can only describe the impact based on the possible values of `i`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `i` is `'1'`: `pa` is 1
- If `i` is not `'1'`: `pa` is 0

Hence, the Output State is:
Output State: **`pa` is either 1 or 0, depending on whether `i` is '1' or not.**
