`pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to the string '1'. The value of `pa` can be either 1 or 0. If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 2 or 1, depending on its previous value; if `i` is not '1', then `pa` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either 1 or 0, and it may be incremented by 1 depending on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`pa` is either 1 or 0; `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.**
