`pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` is either 0 or 1, and the value of `i` can either be '1' or not. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` becomes 1 or 2; if `i` is not '1', `pb` remains the same. The states of `pa` and the ability to iterate through the loop are not directly affected. 

Output State: **`pa` is the count of occurrences of '1' in the input string; `pb` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`.**
