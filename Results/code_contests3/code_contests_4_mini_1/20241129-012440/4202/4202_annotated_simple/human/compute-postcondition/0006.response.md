The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to the string '1'. Since `pa` can either be 1 or 0, the new value of `pa` will be either 2 (if `i` is '1') or 1 (if `i` is not '1'). The state of other variables is not affected, and the output reflects the possible values of `pa`. Therefore, the Output State is: `pa` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`, which can be '1' or not.

Output State: **`pa` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `i`, which can be '1' or not.**
