The function reads two binary strings (strings consisting of characters '0' and '1') from standard input, counts the number of '1's in each string, and then prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to that in the second string, and 'NO' otherwise. It does not accept parameters directly but relies on user input for the two binary strings.
