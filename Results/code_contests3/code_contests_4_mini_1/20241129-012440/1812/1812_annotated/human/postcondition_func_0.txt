The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing a row number and a character `s` (from 'a' to 'f') representing a seat in that row. It computes and prints a specific value based on these inputs, calculated using the formula `(N - 1) // 2 * 7 + (N - 1) // 4 * 2 + (6 - C)`, where `N` is derived from `n` and `C` is the integer value of the seat character. The exact meaning of this output is not detailed in the provided annotations. The function does not handle invalid inputs or errors, such as non-integer or out-of-range values.
