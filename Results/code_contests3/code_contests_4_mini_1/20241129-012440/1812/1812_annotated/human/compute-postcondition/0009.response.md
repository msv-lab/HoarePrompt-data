Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `S` is an input string, `N` is the integer value of `S` excluding the last character, `C` is the integer value of the last character of `S`, and `M` is either 1 or 2. If `M` is 1, then `N` is updated to `N + 1`. If `M` is 2, then `N` is updated to `N + 2`.***
