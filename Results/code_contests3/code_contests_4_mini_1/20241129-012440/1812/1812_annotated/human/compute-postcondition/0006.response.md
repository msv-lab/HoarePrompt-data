Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character from 'a' to 'f', `S` is an input string, `N` is the integer value of `S` excluding the last character, `C` is the integer value of the last character of `S`, `M` is either 1 or 2, and `N` is decreased by `M`, resulting in the new value of `N` being either `N - 1` or `N - 2`.**
