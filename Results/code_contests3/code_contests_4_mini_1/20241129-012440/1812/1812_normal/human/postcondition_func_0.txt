The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\)) and a character `s` (which can be one of 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'). It adjusts the value of `n` based on the computed value of `M`, which is determined by the last character of the input string. It then calculates and prints a specific output based on the final values of `n` and `s`. The function does not handle invalid input cases such as characters outside the specified range or input formats that do not match the expected pattern.
