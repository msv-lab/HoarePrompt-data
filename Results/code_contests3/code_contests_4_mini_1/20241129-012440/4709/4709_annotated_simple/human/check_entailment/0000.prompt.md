You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a 3×3 square grid, where each square contains a lowercase English letters. The letter in the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is c_{ij}.

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters in the squares on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Constraints

* Input consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}
c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}
c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}


Output

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Examples

Input

ant
obe
rec


Output

abc


Input

edu
cat
ion


Output

ean
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines, each containing exactly three lowercase English letters, representing a 3×3 grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is the first input line; `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`; `A` is the first letter of `l`; `B` is the second letter of `l`; if `A` and `B` are equal when converted to integers, then `ans` is set to 1.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the first input line, `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`, `A` is the first letter of `l`, `B` is the second letter of `l`, `i` ranges from `int(A)` to `int(B) - 1`, `C` is a list of the string representation of `i`, and `ans` is the count of integers in that range for which the first element of `C` equals the fifth element of `C` and the second element of `C` equals the fourth element of `C`.
    print(ans)

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
