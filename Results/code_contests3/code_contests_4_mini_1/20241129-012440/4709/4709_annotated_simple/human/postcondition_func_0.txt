The function accepts three lines of lowercase English letters as input, extracts two values from the first two lines, and counts how many integers in the range from the integer value of the first extracted letter to just below the integer value of the second extracted letter satisfy specific character equality conditions in their string representations. It then prints the count, but does not return any value. If the first letter is greater than the second, it will print 0.
