The variable `B` is assigned the value of the second element in the list `l`, which is `l[1]`. Since `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`, the first letter of `l` is `A`, and the second letter is implied to be some other letter. The value of `B` will therefore be the second letter of `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is the first input line; `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`; `A` is the first letter of `l`; `B` is the second letter of `l`.**
