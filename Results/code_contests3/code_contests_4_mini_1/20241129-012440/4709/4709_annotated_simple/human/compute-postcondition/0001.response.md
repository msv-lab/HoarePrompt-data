In the provided code, `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of its components based on whitespace. Since `a` contains three lowercase English letters from the first input line, `l` will be a list of those letters. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the first input line; `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`.**
