The value of `ans` is assigned the value 1, so after execution, `ans` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first input line; `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`; `A` is the first letter of `l`; `B` is the second letter of `l`; `ans` is 1; `A` and `B` are equal when converted to integers.
