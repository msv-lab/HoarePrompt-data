Postcondition: ***`a` is the first input line, `l` is a list of the three letters from `a`, `A` is the first letter of `l`, `B` is the second letter of `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by 1.***
