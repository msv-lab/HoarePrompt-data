#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of three lines, each containing exactly three lowercase English letters, representing a 3x3 grid.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string of three letters, `l` is a list containing that string, `A` is the first character of `a`, `B` is the second character of `a`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string of three letters, `l` is a list containing that string, `A` is the first character of `a`, `B` is the second character of `a`, `ans` is the count of instances where the conditions `C[0] == C[4]` and `C[1] == C[3]` hold true for all integers between the integer values of `A` and `B`, and `C` is a list created from the string representation of the last integer `i` in the range.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads a string of three lowercase letters as input, converts the first two letters to integers `A` and `B`, and counts how many integers in the range from `A` to `B` satisfy a specific condition based on their string representation. However, it lacks error handling for invalid ranges and assumptions about the input format.
