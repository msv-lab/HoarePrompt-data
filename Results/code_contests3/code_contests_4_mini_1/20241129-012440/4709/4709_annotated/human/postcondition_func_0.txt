The function accepts no parameters, reads a string of three lowercase letters as input, converts the first two letters to integers `A` and `B`, and counts how many integers in the range from `A` to `B` satisfy a specific condition based on their string representation. However, it lacks error handling for invalid ranges and assumptions about the input format.
