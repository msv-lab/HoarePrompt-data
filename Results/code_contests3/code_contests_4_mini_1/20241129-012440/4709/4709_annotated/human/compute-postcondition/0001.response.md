The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first line of input, which is a string of three lowercase English letters. The `split()` method is called on `a`, which divides the string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since `a` is a single string of three letters without spaces, the result will be a list containing the entire string as one element. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first line of input (a string of three letters); `l` is a list containing that string.

Output State: **`a` is the first line of input (a string of three letters); `l` is a list containing that string.**
