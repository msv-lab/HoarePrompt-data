Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of three letters, `l` is a list containing that string, `A` is the first character of `a`, `B` is the second character of `a`, `ans` is 1, and `C` is a list created from the string representation of `i`. If the first element of `C` is equal to the fifth element of `C`, and the second element of `C` is equal to the fourth element of `C`, then `ans` is set to 1. There is no else part, so the values of `a`, `l`, `A`, `B`, `C`, and `ans` remain unchanged if the condition is not met.***
