Postcondition: ***`a` is a string of three letters, `l` is a list containing that string, `A` is the first character of `a`, `B` is the second character of `a`, `C` is a list created from the string representation of `i`, and `ans` is 3 if `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2 if the conditions for `ans` being 3 are not met.***
