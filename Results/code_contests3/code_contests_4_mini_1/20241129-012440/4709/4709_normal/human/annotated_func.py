#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as three strings of three characters each.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string input representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid; `A` is assigned the value of `l[0]`; `B` is assigned the value of `l[1]`; if the integer value of `A` is equal to the integer value of `B`, then `ans` is set to 1.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string input representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid; `A` is `l[0]`; `B` is `l[1]`; `i` is equal to `int(B)` after the last iteration; `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i`; `ans` is equal to the count of integers between `A` and `B` (exclusive) for which the first and fifth characters are equal and the second and fourth characters are equal.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string input representing two integers separated by a space, counts the integers between these two values (exclusive) that have a specific pattern in their decimal representation (the first digit equals the fifth digit and the second digit equals the fourth digit), and prints this count. If the two integers are equal, it initializes the count to 1, but overall it does not return a value.
