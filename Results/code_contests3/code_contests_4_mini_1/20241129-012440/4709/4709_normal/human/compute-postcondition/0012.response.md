Postcondition: ***`a` is a string input representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid; `A` is `l[0]`; `B` is `l[1]`; `i` is an integer representing the value of `A`; `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `int(A)`; if the first character of `C` is equal to the fifth character of `C`, and the second character of `C` is equal to the fourth character of `C`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
