Postcondition: ***`a` is a string input representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid; `A` is `l[0]`; `B` is `l[1]`; `i` is `int(A) + 1`; `C` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` equals `C[4]` and `C[1]` equals `C[3]`, then `ans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
