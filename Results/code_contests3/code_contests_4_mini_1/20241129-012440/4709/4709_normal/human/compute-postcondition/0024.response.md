Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input representing two integers separated by a space, counts the integers between these two values (exclusive) that have a specific pattern in their decimal representation (the first digit equals the fifth digit and the second digit equals the fourth digit), and prints this count. If the two integers are equal, it initializes the count to 1, but overall it does not return a value. **
