The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The value of `a` is a string input representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters. Therefore, `l` will be a list containing the rows of the grid as separate elements. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a string input representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list of strings representing the rows of the grid.**
