Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and reads a ticket number with exactly `n` digits, which must consist only of the digits 4 and 7. It then checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input does not meet the specified requirements (e.g., if the digits contain numbers other than 4 and 7 or if `n` is not even). **
