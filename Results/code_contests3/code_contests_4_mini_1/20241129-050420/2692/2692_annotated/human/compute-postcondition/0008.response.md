Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `digits` is a list of integers mapped from a ticket number that contains exactly `n` digits of 4 and 7. If the sum of the first half of the elements in `digits` equals the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
