The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. It also requires a ticket number, which is a positive integer consisting of exactly `n` digits that only contains the digits 4 and 7. The function's output is based on the validity of the ticket number. 

Since the function's output is not specified in detail, we can summarize the expected functionality. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` that defines the length of a ticket number and validate whether the ticket number consists solely of the digits 4 and 7 with the specified length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number, which must be a positive integer with exactly n digits containing only the digits 4 and 7.**
