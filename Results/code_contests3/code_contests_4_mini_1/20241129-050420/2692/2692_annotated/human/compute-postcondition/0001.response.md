The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` takes user input as a string and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, as stated in the initial state. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and it is assigned from user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and it is assigned from user input.**
