Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if the ticket number consists solely of the lucky digits (4 and 7). The problem description explicitly states that the ticket number must be a lucky number, meaning it should only contain the digits 4 and 7. The program simply maps the input digits to integers without validating that all digits are either 4 or 7.

2. **Sum Calculation Logic**: The slicing of the `digits` list for calculating the sums of the two halves is incorrect. The program uses `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` to get the second half of the digits, which is not appropriate for evenly-sized lists. It should be `digits[n / 2:]` instead. The current logic could lead to incorrect comparisons of the sums.

3. **Input Handling**: There is no validation for input constraints beyond checking that `n` is even and within the specified range. The program must ensure that the ticket number is exactly `n` digits long and that it contains only lucky digits.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill all the requirements of the problem description.
