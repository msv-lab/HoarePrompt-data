The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). Additionally, it accepts a ticket number that is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits, containing only the digits 4 and 7. The function determines if the ticket number is considered lucky based on the distribution of the digits. 

Since there are no specific return conditions provided in the output description, we can summarize the following functionality based on the input constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number that is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits composed solely of the digits 4 and 7. It returns whether the ticket number is a lucky ticket based on the digit distribution.**
