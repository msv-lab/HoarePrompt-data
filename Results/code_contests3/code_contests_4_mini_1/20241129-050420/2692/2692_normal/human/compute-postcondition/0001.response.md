The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. Given that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, the output state will reflect that `n` is now a specific integer value provided by the user input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a specific even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
