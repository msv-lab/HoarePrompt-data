The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and expects user input for a ticket number that is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits composed solely of the digits 4 and 7. It calculates the sum of the first half of the digits and compares it to the sum of the second half, printing 'YES' if the two sums are equal and 'NO' otherwise. However, the function does not validate that the input digits are exclusively 4s and 7s, which could lead to incorrect results if other digits are present.
