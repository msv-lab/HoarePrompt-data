Correctness: **False**.

The program has a couple of issues that cause it not to meet the requirements in the problem description:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if all digits in the ticket number are either 4 or 7. The problem description states that a ticket number must be a lucky number, which means it should contain only the digits 4 and 7. The provided program skips this critical check.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The slice for the second half of the digits is incorrect. The code uses `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` to get the second half of the digits. This will not correctly retrieve the second half of the ticket number as it effectively skips one digit when `n` is even. Instead, it should be `digits[n / 2:]`.

To illustrate the first issue, consider the input:
```
4
1234
```
The expected output should be "NO" because 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not lucky digits. However, the program would incorrectly output "NO" based on the sum check, but it would not correctly identify that 1234 is not a lucky number.

Thus, the program is incomplete and fails to meet the problem requirements.
