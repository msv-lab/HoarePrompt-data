The provided program does not fully adhere to the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check whether the ticket number consists solely of the lucky digits (4 and 7). According to the problem description, a number must be a lucky number (composed only of the digits 4 and 7) before checking the sums of its halves. The program should include a validation step to ensure all digits in the ticket number are either 4 or 7.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The slicing used in the sum calculation for the second half of the digits is incorrect. The expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` will not correctly represent the second half of the digits. The correct expression should be `digits[n // 2:]` for the second half.

3. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3. The program should use `input()` to read the input.

4. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO', which is correct, but it does not handle the output format in accordance with the problem description, which specifies that the output must be in all caps ("YES" and "NO" are correct, but the program should also ensure that these outputs are the only ones produced).

Given these points, the program is not correct as it does not implement all the required checks and calculations specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
