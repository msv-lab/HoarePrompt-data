The function `func` accepts no parameters. The constraints specify that `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the ticket number is a positive integer with exactly `n` digits, which may include leading zeros and contains only the digits 4 and 7. The function evaluates the ticket number based on these constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to validate a ticket number that consists of `n` digits (where `n` is an even integer between 2 and 50) and is composed solely of the digits 4 and 7. 

Functionality: **The function checks if the ticket number is a positive integer with exactly n digits, where n is an even integer between 2 and 50, and contains only the digits 4 and 7.**
