`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is an even integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an even integer that has been assigned a positive integer value from input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer that has been assigned a positive integer value from input.**
