The code `digits = map(int, raw_input().strip())` will take an input string, remove any leading or trailing whitespace with `strip()`, and then apply the `int` function to each character (or number) in the input to convert them into integers through the `map` function. The variable `n`, which is an even integer, is not affected by this operation, as `digits` is a new variable created to hold the mapped integers from the input. 

Since the input is not specified, the value of `digits` will depend on the actual input provided during execution. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` remains unchanged and that `digits` will be a mapped object capable of producing integers from the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer that has been assigned a positive integer value from input; `digits` is a map object that will produce integers from the input.**
