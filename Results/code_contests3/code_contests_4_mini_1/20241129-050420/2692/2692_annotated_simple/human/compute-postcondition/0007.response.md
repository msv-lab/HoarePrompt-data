Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer that has been assigned a positive integer value from input, and `digits` is a map object that produces integers from the input. If the sum of the first half of the integers produced by `digits` equals the sum of the second half, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if the sums are not equal, 'NO' is printed.***
