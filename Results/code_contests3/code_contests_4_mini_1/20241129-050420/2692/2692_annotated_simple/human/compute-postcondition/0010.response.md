Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) that represents the number of digits in a ticket number, which must consist solely of the digits 4 and 7. It reads the digits of the ticket number as input and checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. It outputs 'YES' if the sums are equal and 'NO' otherwise. However, the function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-digit characters) or check if the digits are strictly 4s and 7s, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
