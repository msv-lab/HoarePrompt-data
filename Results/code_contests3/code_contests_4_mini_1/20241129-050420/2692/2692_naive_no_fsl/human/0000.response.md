Correctness: **False**

The program has a couple of issues that lead to incorrect results. Here are the problems:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The program does not check if the ticket number consists only of the lucky digits (4 or 7). According to the problem description, a ticket must be a lucky number before checking the sums of its halves. That means a number like `4738`, which contains an '8', should immediately result in "NO".

2. **Sum Calculation**: The slicing for the second half of the digits is incorrect. The line `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]` should actually be `digits[n / 2:]`. The current implementation will skip the first digit of the second half when calculating the sum.

Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates the issues:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  7384
  ```
- Expected Output: "NO" (since '3' and '8' are not lucky digits).
- Actual Output: "YES" (it incorrectly checks the sums of halves as 7 and 4).

This shows that the program does not adhere to the requirements of the problem description, leading to incorrect results.
