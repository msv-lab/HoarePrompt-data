Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input. It checks if the input contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and terminates the check. If none of these characters are present, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but produces output based on the presence of these specific characters in the input string. **
