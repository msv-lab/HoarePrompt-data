The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `i` must be the next element in the list `a`, and `a` must have at least one more element after the current one; 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop.
