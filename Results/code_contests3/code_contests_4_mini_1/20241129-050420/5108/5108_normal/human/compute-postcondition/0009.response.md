In this case, the value of `a` is assigned the string 'tstr123'. The variable `p` remains unchanged as the assignment does not affect it. The output state reflects the values of the variables after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'**
