According to the code, the loop iterates over the input string `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least 1 character. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `a` during the iterations. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty string, and at the start of the loop, `i` should be the first character of `a`. 

State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, for the loop to execute the first time `a` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `a`**
