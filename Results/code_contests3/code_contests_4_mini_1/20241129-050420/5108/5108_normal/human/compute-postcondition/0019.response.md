The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `p` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', and the string 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is not equal to 'tstr123', and 'NO' is printed.**
