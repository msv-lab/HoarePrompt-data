The variable `a` is assigned the value 'tstr123'. The initial state of `p` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment, and the variable `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` along with the unchanged states of `p` and `i`. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is either 'H', 'Q', or '9'; 'YES' is printed.**
