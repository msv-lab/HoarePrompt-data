The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The initial state indicates that `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, and since `raw_input()` will allow the user to enter a valid string, `a` will hold that input string. The variable `p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is an input string.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is an input string**
