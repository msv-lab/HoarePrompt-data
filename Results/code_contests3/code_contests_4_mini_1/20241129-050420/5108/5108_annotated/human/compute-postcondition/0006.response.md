Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and if `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', then 'YES' is printed and the most internal loop or statement is exited. If `i` is not one of these characters, the program does not print anything and continues execution.***
