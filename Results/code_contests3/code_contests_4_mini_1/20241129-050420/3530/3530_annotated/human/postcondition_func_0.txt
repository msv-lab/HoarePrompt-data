The function accepts an integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of dimensions N x N, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating compatibility between N men and N women. It calculates the total number of valid pairings of men and women based on this compatibility matrix and outputs the result modulo 1000000007. The function does not handle cases where the input `N` or the compatibility matrix might be invalid; it assumes valid input.
