You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and a is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, representing the compatibility between N men and N women, with dimensions N x N.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains a list with `n` entries from the input integers; `MOD` is 1000000007.
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, and `dp[0][i]` is set to 1 for all `i` in the range `0` to `2^n - 1`.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, and `dp[n][mask]` contains the cumulative contributions from valid states based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`, with each entry taken modulo `MOD`, for all `mask` in the range from `1` to `2^n - 1`.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of dimensions N x N, where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating compatibility between N men and N women. It calculates the total number of valid pairings of men and women based on this compatibility matrix and outputs the result modulo 1000000007. The function does not handle cases where the input `N` or the compatibility matrix might be invalid; it assumes valid input.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
