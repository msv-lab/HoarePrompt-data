According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute a third time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `j` was 1, the loop can proceed as long as `n` is greater than 2. 

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
