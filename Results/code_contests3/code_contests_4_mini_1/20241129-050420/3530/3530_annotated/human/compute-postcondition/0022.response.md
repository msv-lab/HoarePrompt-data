The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `mask` is 1, we need to evaluate `mask ^ 1 << j`. Since `mask` has the j-th bit set and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, it indicates that the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` contributes positively to the current state. The specific values of `dp` prior to this operation are not provided, but the operation takes place based on the aforementioned conditions.

Therefore, we can conclude that `dp[1][1]` is updated based on the value from `dp[0][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`dp[1][1]` is updated based on `dp[0][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `mask` is 1, `i` is 1, and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.**
