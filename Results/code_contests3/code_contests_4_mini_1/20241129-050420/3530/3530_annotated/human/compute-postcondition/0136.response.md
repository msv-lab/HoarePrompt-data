The line of code updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and reducing it modulo `MOD`. The previous state `dp[i][mask]` was already updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `j` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the operation modifies the current state of `dp[i][mask]` to ensure it fits within the bounds defined by `MOD`. 

The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
