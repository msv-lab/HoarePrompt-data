Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` contains the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`, based on `dp[0][mask ^ 1 << j]`. If these conditions are not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
