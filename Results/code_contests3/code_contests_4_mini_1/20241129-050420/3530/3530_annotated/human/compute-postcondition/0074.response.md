The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables directly. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` with respect to the modulus operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and then `dp[i][mask]` is reduced modulo `MOD`.**
