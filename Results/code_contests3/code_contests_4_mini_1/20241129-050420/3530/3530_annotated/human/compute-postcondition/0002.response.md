The code initializes `a` as an empty list. This assignment does not affect the values of `N`, `MOD`, or `n`. The previous state of `a` was not defined, but now it is an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.**
