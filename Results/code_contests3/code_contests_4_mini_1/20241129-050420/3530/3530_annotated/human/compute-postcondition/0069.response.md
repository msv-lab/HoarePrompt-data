The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Given that:
- `dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, where each entry is a list of size `2^n`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `mask` is 1.
- `j` is 0.
- The condition states that the element at index `[i - 1][j]` of `a` is equal to 1.
- The bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.

The operation involves using the bitwise XOR (`^`) and the left shift operation (`1 << j`). Since `j` is 0, `1 << j` results in 1, and hence `mask ^ 1 << j` becomes `1 ^ 1`, which equals 0.

Therefore, the code effectively updates `dp[n + 1][1]` by adding the value from `dp[n][0]` to it.

The output state can be summarized as: 
- The value of `dp[n + 1][1]` has been updated based on the value of `dp[n][0]`. 
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, where `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
