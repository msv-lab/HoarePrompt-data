The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` indicates that we are updating the value at `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given:
- `dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, where each entry is a list of size `2^n`.
- `mask` is `k + 1`, which is less than `2^n`.
- `j` is 0.
- The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.
- The bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is not zero, meaning that the bit represented by `j` is set in `mask`.

Since `mask ^ 1 << j` effectively toggles the bit at position `j` in `mask`, we are accessing the value at `dp[i - 1]` for this modified `mask`.

This operation modifies the value in `dp` at the index `[i][mask]`, and it accumulates the value from the previous state of `dp` at the index `[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

The output state will include the updated value at `dp[i][mask]`, but without specific values for `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, we can only describe the change.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, where `mask` is `k + 1` and `j` is 0.**
