Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j`), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulus with `MOD` and adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it; otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
