Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, each entry is a list of size `2^n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` includes the `j`th bit, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, reduced modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
