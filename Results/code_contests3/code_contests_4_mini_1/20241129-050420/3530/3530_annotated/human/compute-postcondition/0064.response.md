Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative updates based on valid contributions from the previous states, calculated using the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`, with each entry taken modulo `MOD`.**
