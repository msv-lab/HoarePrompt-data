Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `mask` is greater than or equal to `2^n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`. The final state of `dp[i][mask]` reflects the cumulative updates made during all iterations of the loop.**
