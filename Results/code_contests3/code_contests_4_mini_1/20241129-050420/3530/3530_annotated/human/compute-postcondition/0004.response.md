The `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` line is executed, which means the program takes an input string representing multiple integers, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer using `map(int, ...)`, and then appends the resulting map object to the list `a`. Since `a` is initially an empty list, after this line executes, `a` will contain a new entry that is a list of integers derived from the input string. The variable `N` remains unchanged, and `MOD` is also unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains a list with one entry from the input integers; `MOD` is 1000000007**
