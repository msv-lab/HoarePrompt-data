According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from `0` to `2^n - 1`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to `0`, which would allow `1 << n` (or `2^n`) to be at least `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, `n` needs to be non-negative, and `i` should start at `0` for the first iteration.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n` initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is 0**
