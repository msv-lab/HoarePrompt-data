According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, meaning that `j` has reached its upper limit of `n`. Since `j` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will not execute again unless `j` is reset.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has executed `n` times for `j` values of 0 through `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented beyond `n - 1`, specifically to `n`, and `dp[i]` will still be based on the previous values.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is `n`**
