The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` attempts to apply the modulo operation with `MOD` on the value stored in `dp[i][mask]`. However, since the loop does not execute anymore, the value of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged. Therefore, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged since the loop does not execute anymore.**
