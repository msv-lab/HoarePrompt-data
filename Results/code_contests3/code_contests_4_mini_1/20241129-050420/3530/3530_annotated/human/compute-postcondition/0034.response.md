According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \(1 << n\) (which is \(2^n\)). This means that the loop will execute for each value of `mask` starting from 1 up to \(2^n - 1\).

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` must be equal to \(1 << n - 1\) (which is \(2^n - 1\)) for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `mask` must be incremented to \(2^n\), which is outside the range of the current loop.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, for the loop to execute one more time `mask` must be greater than or equal to `2^n`.**
