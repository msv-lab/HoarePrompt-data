According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `0` up to `n - 1`. Before the loop starts, `j` needs to be initialized to `0` for the loop to execute for the first time. 

Additionally, the states related to `mask` should be adjusted so that `mask` is `k + 1` and `mask` is less than `2^n`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure:
- `j` is `0` for the first iteration.
- `mask` should be `k + 1` where `k` is the last value of `mask`, and it must be less than `2^n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `j` is 0, `mask` is `k + 1`, and `mask` is less than `2^n` for the loop to execute the first time.**
