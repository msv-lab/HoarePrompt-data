According to the code, the loop is set to execute for the range of `mask`, which runs from `1` to `(1 << n) - 1`. The initial state mentions that `i` is `n + 1`, which suggests that `i` is out of bounds for the loop to execute. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`, since `1 << n` is `2^n`, and we need at least one iteration. 

Additionally, the value of `mask` must be able to start at `1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `1`. 

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute at least once `n` must be greater than 0, and `mask` is 1**
