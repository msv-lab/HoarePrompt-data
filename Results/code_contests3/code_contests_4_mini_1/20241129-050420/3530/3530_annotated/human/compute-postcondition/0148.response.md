Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `j` is 0, and `mask` is `k + 1`, which is less than `2^n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the `j`-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
