According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from 0 to `n - 1`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. The current state shows `i` as `n + 1`, which is outside the range of `j` values in the loop. Since `mask` is set to 1, it does not affect the loop execution directly.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute at least once:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

Thus, we can conclude that before the loop starts, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `mask` is still 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `i` is `n + 1`, for the loop to execute at least once `n` is greater than 0, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0**
