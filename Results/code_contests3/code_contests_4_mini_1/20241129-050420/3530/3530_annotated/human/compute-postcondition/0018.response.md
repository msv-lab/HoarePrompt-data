According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. Additionally, the loop variable `i` should be initialized to 1 for the first execution of the loop.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1**
