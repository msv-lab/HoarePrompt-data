Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, and `dp[n][mask]` contains the cumulative contributions from valid states based on the conditions involving `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`, with each entry taken modulo `MOD`, for all `mask` in the range from `1` to `2^n - 1`.**
