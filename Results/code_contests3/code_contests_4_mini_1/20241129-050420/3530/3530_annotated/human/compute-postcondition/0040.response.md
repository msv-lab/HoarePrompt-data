According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will change from 0 to 1. 

Since `n` is a variable that is mentioned to determine the loop's upper bound, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
