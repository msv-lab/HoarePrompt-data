The code assigns the value 1 to the specific entry in the `dp` list, where `dp[0][i]` is set to 1. The variable `i` has the value `2^n - 1` based on the initial state. This means that the entry `dp[0][2^n - 1]` will be updated to 1. Other entries in the `dp` list remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `dp[0][i]` is set to 1 where `i` is `2^n - 1`.**
