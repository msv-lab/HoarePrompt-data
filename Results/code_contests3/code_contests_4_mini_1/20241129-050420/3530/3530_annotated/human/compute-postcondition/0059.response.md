According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop executes for values of `j` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to be valid, `n` must be greater than 2, allowing the loop to execute for the third time.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2**
