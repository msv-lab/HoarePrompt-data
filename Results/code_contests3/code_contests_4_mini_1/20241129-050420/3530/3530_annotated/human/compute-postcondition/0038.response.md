The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` takes the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and updates it by taking the modulus with `MOD`. This means that the value of `dp[i][mask]` will be the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is an updated value due to the prior operation. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
