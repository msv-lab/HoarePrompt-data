Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `mask` is `k + 1` (where `k + 1` is less than `2^n`), and `j` has iterated over all values from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j`-th bit set for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the corresponding values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, taken modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
