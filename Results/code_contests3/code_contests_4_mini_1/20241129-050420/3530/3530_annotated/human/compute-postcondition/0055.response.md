According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `n` dictates the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `j` remains less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Thus, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
