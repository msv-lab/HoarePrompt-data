Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo of `dp[i][mask]` with `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
