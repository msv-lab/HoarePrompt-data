The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` was updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, but we do not have specific values for these variables. The other variables (`i`, `mask`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`, and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`, while `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]`, and then `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`, while `i` is n + 1, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
