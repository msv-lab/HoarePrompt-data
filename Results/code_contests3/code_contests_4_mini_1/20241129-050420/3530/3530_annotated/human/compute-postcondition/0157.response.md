Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `mask` is `k + 1`, which is less than `2^n`. The values of `dp[i][mask]` have been updated based on the conditions of the loop for all valid `j` values, taking into account the corresponding values from `dp[i - 1]` modulo `MOD`.**
