According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the size of `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, executing for each value of `j` from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `n - 1` for the last execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Currently, `j` is `n - 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, which is always true since `n` is positive.

So, after the last iteration, `j` would be incremented to `n`, and the loop cannot execute again because it only runs while `j < n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be `n` (the loop will not execute anymore since it only runs while `j < n`)**
