Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, `j` is 0, and `mask` is a valid value. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on a valid contribution from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
