Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` for all `j` in the range `0` to `n - 1`, taking into account the conditions evaluated for each `j` with respect to `mask` and the modulo `MOD`.**
