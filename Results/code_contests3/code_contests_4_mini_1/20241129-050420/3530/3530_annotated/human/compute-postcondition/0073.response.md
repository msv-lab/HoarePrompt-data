The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Here, `i` is `n + 1`, `mask` is 1, and `j` is `n`. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` calculates the new index to access in the `dp` list. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it will increase based on the value obtained from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Thus, the output state is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]**
