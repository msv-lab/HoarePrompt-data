The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user as a single line of space-separated integers, splits that line into individual string elements, converts each string to an integer, and appends the resulting integers as a list to `a`. Since `a` currently contains one entry from the input integers, it will now contain that entry plus the new integers from the user input. The previous value of `a` is not specified, but we know that it will have at least one element, and it will now have more.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` now contains a list with the original entry plus additional integers from input; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
