The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and then applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This means that the value of `dp[i][mask]` is constrained to be within the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`. The previous values of the other variables are not impacted directly by this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
