Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `mask` is `k + 1` (where `k + 1` is less than `2^n`), and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, followed by taking the result modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
