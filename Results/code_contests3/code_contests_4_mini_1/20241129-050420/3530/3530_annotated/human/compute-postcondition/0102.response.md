According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will iterate while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `mask` is `k + 1` (where `k + 1` is less than `2^n`), and `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
