According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n`. The loop runs as long as the variable `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than the current iteration count. Since `_` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be equal to the current count of iterations, which means `N` must be greater than the current count of `_`.

If we assume that the loop has executed `k` times so far, then `N` must be greater than `k`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `_` would need to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than k, and _ is k.**
