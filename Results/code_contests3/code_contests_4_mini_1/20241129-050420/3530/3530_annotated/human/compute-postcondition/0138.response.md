According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j`, which iterates over the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` would have been increased by 1. Since the loop starts from `j = 0` and continues while `j < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. 

Given that `j` was incremented at the end of the last iteration, `j` would now be `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be adjusted to `n` and it cannot execute again since the loop condition `j < n` will not be satisfied.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than `n`, but `j` is now `n`**
