According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more for the next value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its maximum value for the current loop, which would be `n - 1`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented to `n`, which means the loop cannot execute again because the range of `j` is from 0 to `n - 1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute once more, `j` would need to be `n`, and the loop will not be able to execute again since `j` is no longer less than `n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, each entry is a list of size `2^n`, for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be `n`, which is out of the loop range.**
