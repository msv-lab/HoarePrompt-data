According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, meaning it will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Given that `j` is currently at its last value (which is `n - 1`), for the loop to execute again, it must advance to `n`. Therefore, the new state for the next iteration will reflect that `j` has increased to `n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be equal to `n`.**
