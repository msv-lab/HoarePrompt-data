The code updates the value at `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since `j` must be equal to `n` for the loop to execute, and with the current state indicating that `j` is not less than `n`, the loop will not execute anymore. Therefore, the values of `dp` remain unchanged as the update does not take place.

Output State: **`dp` remains unchanged since the loop does not execute anymore.**
