According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the size of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and the loop can execute again if `j` is still less than `n`.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `i` is set to `n`, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n`.**
