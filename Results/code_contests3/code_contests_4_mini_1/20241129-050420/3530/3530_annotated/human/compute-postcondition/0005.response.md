According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. In the given state, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed for `_` times, which is less than `N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1. 

Since the loop has executed `_` times and `N` is greater than `_`, the next iteration will occur if `N` is greater than `_ + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains a list with one entry from the input integers, `MOD` is 1000000007, for the loop to execute again `_` must be less than `N` and `_` will be incremented by 1.**
