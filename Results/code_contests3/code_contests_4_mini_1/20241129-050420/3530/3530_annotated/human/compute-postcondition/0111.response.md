Output State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the values of `a[i - 1][j]` for all `mask` in the range from `1` to `2^n - 1`, considering the conditions evaluated for each `j` from `0` to `n - 1`, and the updates are taken modulo `MOD`.**
