According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, meaning there is at least one more iteration possible. For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` remains greater than 1.

State: **`dp` is a list of size `n + 1` where each entry is a list of size `2^n`, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
