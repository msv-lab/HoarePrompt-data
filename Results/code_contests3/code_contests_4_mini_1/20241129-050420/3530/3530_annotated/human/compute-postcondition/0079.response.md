Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of size `n + 1`, where each entry is a list of size `2^n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, while the state of other variables remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
