In the provided code snippet, the expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. 

1. The variable `mask` has the j-th bit set, which means that `mask ^ (1 << j)` will toggle the j-th bit of `mask`.
2. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value located at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`.
3. Since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, it indicates that the condition for the operation is satisfied.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `dp[i][mask]` is the current value being updated
- `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` is the value being added

Thus, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the values from the previous row in the `dp` structure.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it, where `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1.**
