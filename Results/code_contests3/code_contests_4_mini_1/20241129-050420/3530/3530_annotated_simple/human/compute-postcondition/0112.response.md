According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and continues until `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at some value between 1 and `n`. 

If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again; thus, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, to adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop, we need to set `i` to `i + 1`. 

Since `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, it remains unchanged in this context. We only need to ensure that `i` is updated correctly.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, `i` is incremented to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.**
