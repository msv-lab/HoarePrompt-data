The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Given the initial state, `dp` is a 2D list and the specific indices being accessed are `i` and `mask`, where `mask` is less than `(1 << n) - 1`. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, which indicates that the operation is valid. 

Since the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, the operation can be performed. Therefore, the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is being added to `dp[i][mask]`.

Other variables are not affected in this operation, so the output state reflects the change in `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, where `mask` is less than `(1 << n) - 1` and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.**
