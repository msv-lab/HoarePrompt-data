Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and for each `j` from 0 to n-1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the condition of `a[i - 1][j]` and the corresponding bit in `mask`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` contains the sum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
