The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unchanged but will now be adjusted to fit within the range of `MOD`. Other variables such as `j`, `i`, and `mask` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is 1, and other variables remain unchanged.**
