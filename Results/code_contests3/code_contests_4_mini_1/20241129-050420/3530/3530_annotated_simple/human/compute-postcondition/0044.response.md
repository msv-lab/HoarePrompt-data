According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the current index, and for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop has executed with `j` as the current index, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented and must now be equal to the next index, which is `j + 1`. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), for the loop to execute a second time `j` is incremented to `j + 1`, which must be less than `n`.**
