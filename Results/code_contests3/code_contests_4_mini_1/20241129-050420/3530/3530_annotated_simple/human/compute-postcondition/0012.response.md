The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value `1`. Given that `i` is `0`, the specific assignment becomes `dp[0][0] = 1`. The initial state of the `dp` array was all zeros, so after this execution, `dp[0][0]` changes from `0` to `1`. The other dimensions of the `dp` array are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)` initialized with zeros, where `dp[0][0]` is 1**
