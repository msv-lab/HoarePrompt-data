The code appends a new row to the 2D list `a`, which is created from the input values converted to integers. Since `raw_input()` collects input from the user and `map(int, ...)` converts these input strings into integers, the previous state of `a` is expanded by one row containing these new integer values. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with an additional row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a string that represents an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with an additional row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a string that represents an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1**
