The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions N x N. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the contents of the 2D list `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a consisting of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions N x N. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the contents of the list.**
