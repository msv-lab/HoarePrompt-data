The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is dependent on the earlier computation where it was updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The values of `n`, `j`, `mask`, and `a[i - 1][j]` do not change in this operation, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it ensures that the indexing for `i` is valid. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is now guaranteed to be within the bounds set by `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
