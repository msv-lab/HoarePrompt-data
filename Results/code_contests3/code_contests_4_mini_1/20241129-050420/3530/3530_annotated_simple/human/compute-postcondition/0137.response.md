Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n). If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
