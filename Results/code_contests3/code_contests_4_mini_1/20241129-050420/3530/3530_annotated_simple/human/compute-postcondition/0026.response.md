The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The `mask ^ 1 << j` operation computes a new mask by flipping the j-th bit of the mask. 

The values of `dp`, `i`, and `mask` are affected by this operation, with `dp[i][mask]` being increased by the corresponding value from the previous row of the `dp` table.

Since the initial state provides that `dp` is a 2D list, and `n` is greater than `j + 1` (allowing the loop to execute), we can ascertain that this operation will take place.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it; `n` is greater than `j + 1`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**
