According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1 and `n` remains greater than `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value, which will be `j + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than that new `j`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was `j`, it will now be `j + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `j` is now `j + 1`**
