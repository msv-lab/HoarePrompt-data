The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variable `mask` is currently 1, and since `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero, the operation proceeds. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` will determine the new value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Since `mask` is 1, the expression `mask ^ 1 << j` will depend on the value of `j`. In this case, `j` is 0, so `1 << j` equals 1, thus `mask ^ 1` results in 0. Therefore, the operation can be summarized as:

- `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it.

Assuming `dp[i][mask]` had some previous value, it now increases by the value of `dp[i - 1][0]`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][0]`**
