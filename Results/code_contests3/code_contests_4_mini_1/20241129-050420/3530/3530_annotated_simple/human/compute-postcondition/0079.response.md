Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`, where `dp[i][mask]` retains its previous value modulo `MOD`, and since `j` is equal to `n`, the loop cannot execute again.***
