Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is incremented to the next valid value which is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, indicating that the j-th bit of `mask` is set.***
