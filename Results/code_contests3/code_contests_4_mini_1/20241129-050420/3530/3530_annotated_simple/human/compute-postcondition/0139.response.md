To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we analyze the impact of the line `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` on the `dp` variable.

1. The variable `dp` is a 2D list where `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` represent specific values in the list. 
2. The variable `j` holds the value `n - 1`, which indicates that `1 << j` calculates `2^(n-1)`.
3. The operation `mask ^ (1 << j)` performs a bitwise XOR between `mask` and `2^(n-1)`, resulting in a new mask value.
4. The code updates the current state `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Since the specific values of `i`, `mask`, and the contents of the `dp` array are not provided, we can only describe the general change occurring within the list.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << (n - 1))]`**.
