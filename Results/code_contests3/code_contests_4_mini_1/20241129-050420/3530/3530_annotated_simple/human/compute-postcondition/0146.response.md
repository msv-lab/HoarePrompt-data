The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The initial state indicates that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and since the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value, it confirms that the j-th bit of `mask` is indeed set.

Thus, `dp[i][mask]` will be incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` are not specified in the initial state, so we can only denote that `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on its previous value and the referenced value from `dp`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to its previous value.**
