The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the modulo with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by the operation of `dp[i][mask]` being divided by `MOD`, ensuring it remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not specified, but we know that `dp[i][mask]` will now be the result of that modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo with `MOD`**
