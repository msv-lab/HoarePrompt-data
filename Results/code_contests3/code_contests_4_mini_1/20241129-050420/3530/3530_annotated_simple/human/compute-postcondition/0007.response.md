According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 1, it needs to be converted to an integer for comparison. The loop will execute for each iteration until `_` reaches the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` must be incremented to 2, and `n` must represent an integer value greater than 2 to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, `a` is a 2D list with an additional row of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2**
