The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its previous value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation modifies `dp[i][mask]`, but does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulo operation. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulo operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`**
