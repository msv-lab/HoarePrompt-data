The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, but the operation ensures that the updated value remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The other variables and values are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus operation using `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulus operation using `MOD`**
