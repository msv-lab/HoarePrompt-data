Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is in the range from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, and for each valid `mask`, `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the previous values of `dp[i - 1]` and the conditions of `a[i - 1][j]`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` will be updated accordingly.**
