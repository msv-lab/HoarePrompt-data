Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), and `mask` is a valid value in the range. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the result of the modulo operation with `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
