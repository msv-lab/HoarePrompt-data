Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), and `mask` is a valid value in the range. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` for each `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set. If these conditions are not met for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
