According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will iterate `n` times, which means it will execute if `n` is at least 1. The initial state indicates that `i` is `n` (or less), and `mask` is already set to a valid value that is less than `1 << n`. 

Since `j` will start from 0, for the loop to execute for the first time, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized correctly. Therefore, it is reasonable to adjust the state to indicate that `j` starts from 0. 

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is incremented to the next valid value which is less than `1 << n`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
