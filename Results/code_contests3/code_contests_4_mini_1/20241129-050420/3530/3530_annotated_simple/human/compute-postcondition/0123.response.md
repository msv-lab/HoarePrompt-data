According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value (which is less than `n`). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `j` will be incremented, if `j` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, in order for the loop to execute again, `j` must equal `k + 1`, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `k + 1` and `j` is `k + 1`**
