In this code snippet, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The operation involves bitwise manipulation where `mask` is XORed with `1 << j`. This means the value from the previous row in the `dp` table is accessed, specifically the cell that corresponds to the modified `mask`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `dp[i][mask]` is being updated, so its value will change.
- `mask ^ (1 << j)` calculates a new index based on `mask` by toggling the j-th bit.
- The previous value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` is added to the current value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `dp` at `i` and `mask`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i][mask] by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`**.
