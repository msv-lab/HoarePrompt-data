The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged until this operation is performed. The operation does not affect the values of `j` or `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has now been constrained within the range defined by `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than `j + 1`.**
