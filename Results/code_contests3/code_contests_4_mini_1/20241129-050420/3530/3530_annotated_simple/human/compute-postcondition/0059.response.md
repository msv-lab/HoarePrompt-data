According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the parameter `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1. After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2.**
