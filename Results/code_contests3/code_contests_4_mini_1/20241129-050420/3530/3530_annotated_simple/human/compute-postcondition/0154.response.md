The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variable `mask` is altered by performing a bitwise XOR with `1 << j`, which represents a bitmask where the j-th bit is toggled. The previous values of `dp` are not specified here, but the operation indicates that `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by a specific value from the previous row of the `dp` table.

Since the exact previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not given, we can only state the operation being performed without specific numerical outcomes.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**.
