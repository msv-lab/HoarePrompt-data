According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it can execute a total of `n` times, with `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 on each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value (which is `n`).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently `n`, it will increment to `n + 1` for the next iteration, and `i` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be `n + 1`.**
