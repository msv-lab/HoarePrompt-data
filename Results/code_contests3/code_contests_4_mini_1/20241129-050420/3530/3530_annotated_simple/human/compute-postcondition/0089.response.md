The line `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is not explicitly provided, but it is assumed that it has been updated previously by adding a certain value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The variables `j` and `n` are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]` after the modulo operation while indicating that other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`; `j` is `j + 1`; `n` is greater than `j + 1`.**
