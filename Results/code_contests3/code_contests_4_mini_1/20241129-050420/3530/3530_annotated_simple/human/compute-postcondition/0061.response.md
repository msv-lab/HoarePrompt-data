The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by first calculating `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << 2)]`. After this calculation, the result is then taken modulo `MOD`, which is a typical operation to ensure the value stays within a certain range. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << 2)]` would influence the outcome, but since specific values are not provided, we simply note that the modulo operation is applied to the result.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated and then taken modulo `MOD`**
