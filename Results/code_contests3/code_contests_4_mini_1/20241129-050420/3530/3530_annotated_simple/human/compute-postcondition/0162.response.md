Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of size `N x N` containing integers (0 or 1). It calculates and prints the number of valid configurations represented by a bitmask using dynamic programming. Specifically, it counts the ways to select elements based on the conditions defined in the list `a`, where a `1` indicates that the corresponding element can be selected. The function ultimately returns the count of configurations that use all `N` elements. It does not handle invalid inputs or cases where `N` is outside the specified range. **
