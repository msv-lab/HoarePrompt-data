According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` starting from 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since the loop executes for `j` values in the range of `n`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented. 

Therefore, after the last iteration where `j` was 0, we need to set `j` to 1 for the next iteration. The loop will execute for `j` equal to 1, which is still within the limits as `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
