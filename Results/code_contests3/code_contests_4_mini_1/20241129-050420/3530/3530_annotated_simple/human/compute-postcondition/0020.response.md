According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, before the loop starts, `j` needs to be initialized to 0, as it represents the current iteration index. The `mask` is already set to 1, which is appropriate for the first iteration.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 0, `mask` is 1**
