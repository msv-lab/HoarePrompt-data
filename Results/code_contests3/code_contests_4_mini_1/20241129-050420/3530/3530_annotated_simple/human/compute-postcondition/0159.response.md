Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, where `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative number of ways to achieve the configuration represented by `mask` using the first `i` elements of `a`, based on the conditions defined in the loop. Specifically, if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the j-th bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by the sum of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` across all valid `j`. If no conditions are met during the iterations, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from the previous values.**
