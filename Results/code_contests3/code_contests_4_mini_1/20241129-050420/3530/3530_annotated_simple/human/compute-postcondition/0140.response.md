The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, so the exact result of the operation cannot be determined. However, the modulo operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` will remain within the range defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated using modulo operation with `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated using modulo operation with `MOD`.**
