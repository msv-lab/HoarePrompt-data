According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` values starting from 1 up to `1 << n`. The variable `mask` is currently at a value that is less than `1 << n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n` (or less), and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions defined in the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `mask` was at its last value in the previous iteration, it would have been less than `1 << n`. After incrementing, `mask` will be one greater than its previous value.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is the next value in the range (i.e., the current value of mask + 1), for the loop to execute one more time `mask` must be less than `1 << n`.**
