Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `mask` is less than `1 << n`, and `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` contains the bit at position `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
