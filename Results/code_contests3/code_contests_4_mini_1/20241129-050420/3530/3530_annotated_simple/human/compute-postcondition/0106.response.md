According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range defined by `n`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Therefore, if `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 2.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `mask` is less than (1 << n) - 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
