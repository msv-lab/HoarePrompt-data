The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][0]` in the previous state, and now it is taken modulo `MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` will hold the result of its previous value plus the value from `dp[i - 1][0]`, then reduced by `MOD`. The specific values of `dp[i][mask]`, `dp[i - 1][0]`, and `MOD` are not provided, but the operation will update `dp[i][mask]` accordingly. Therefore, the output state reflects the update to `dp[i][mask]` after applying the modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `(dp[i][mask] + dp[i - 1][0]) % MOD`**
