The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask value by flipping the j-th bit of the current mask. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n); `n` must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to execute one more time; `j` is `k + 1`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n); `n` must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to execute one more time; `j` is `k + 1`**
