Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
