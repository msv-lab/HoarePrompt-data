According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes again, `j` will be `j + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `j + 1`, and `j` will be `j + 1`.**
