Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `mask` is less than (1 << n) - 1, and `j` is at least 0 and less than n. After all iterations, `dp[i][mask]` contains the updated values based on the conditions evaluated in the loop, and remains unchanged if conditions are not met for any `j`.**
