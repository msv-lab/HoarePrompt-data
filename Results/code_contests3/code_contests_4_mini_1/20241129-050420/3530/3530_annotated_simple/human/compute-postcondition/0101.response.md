Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `mask` is less than (1 << n) - 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value modulo `MOD` after the addition, while all other variables remain unchanged.***
