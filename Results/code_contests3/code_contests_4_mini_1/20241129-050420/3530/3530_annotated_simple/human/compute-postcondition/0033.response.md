Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` will contain the cumulative updates based on the conditions being met for all values of `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set, `dp[i][mask]` will be updated by the sum of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` across all valid `j`, taken modulo `MOD`. If no conditions are met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
