According to the code, the loop will execute again based on the variable `n`. The variable `n` is a string that represents an integer greater than 0, which means that it is necessary to convert it to an integer to determine how many times the loop should execute. The variable `_` is currently 0, indicating that the loop has not executed yet. 

Since `n` represents an integer greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1. This means that `_` will be 1 after this iteration. 

Therefore, the conditions for the loop to execute a second time depend on the value of `n` and the incremented value of `_`. The value of `n` must still be greater than `_` in order for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, `a` is a 2D list containing a new row from the input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a string that represents an integer greater than 1, and `_` is 1**
