Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`, where `dp[i][mask]` is the result of all valid updates based on the conditions met during the iterations of `j`, modulo `MOD`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` contains the sum of all valid configurations calculated from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
