The value of `dp[i][mask]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Given that `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1, we can infer that the operation is valid. The specific values of `dp[i]`, `dp[i - 1]`, `mask`, and `j` are not provided, but the operation indicates that we are updating the `dp` table based on a previous state.

Since `mask` has a bit set at position `j`, `mask ^ (1 << j)` will effectively toggle that bit off in the `mask`. The output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been modified based on the previous state of `dp[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`**
