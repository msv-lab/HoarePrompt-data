Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (1 << n), `i` is n (or less), `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions defined in the loop for all valid `j` indices where `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and the corresponding bit in `mask` is set. If none of these conditions are met for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
