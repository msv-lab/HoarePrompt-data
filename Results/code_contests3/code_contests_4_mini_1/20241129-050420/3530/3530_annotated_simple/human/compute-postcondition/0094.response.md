Postcondition: ***`dp` is a 2D list of size `(n + 1) x (1 << n)`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains greater than `j + 1`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`, `j`, or `n`.***
