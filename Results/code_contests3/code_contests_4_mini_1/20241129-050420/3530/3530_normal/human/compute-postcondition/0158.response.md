Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is in the range from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values derived from the conditions checked across all indices `j` from 0 to `n-1` in the array `a`. Specifically, `dp[3][mask]` is updated based on the conditions where `a[2][j]` is 1 and `mask & (1 << j)` evaluates to true, resulting in the sum of all relevant `dp[2][mask ^ (1 << j)]` values taken modulo `MOD`.**
