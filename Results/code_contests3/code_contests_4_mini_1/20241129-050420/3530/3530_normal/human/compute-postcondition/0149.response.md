According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain at least 3, as it is currently.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `mask` is the next value in the range.**
