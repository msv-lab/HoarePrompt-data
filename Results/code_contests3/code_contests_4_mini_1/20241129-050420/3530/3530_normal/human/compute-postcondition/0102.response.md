According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. Since the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 for the next iteration. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1.**
