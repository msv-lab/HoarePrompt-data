According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1. Thus, after the current iteration, `j` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 2 since `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
