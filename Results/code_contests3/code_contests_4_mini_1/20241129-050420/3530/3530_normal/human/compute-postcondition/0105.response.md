Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 2; `mask` is 2; `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][0]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the modulus operation.***
