The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` indicates that the value at `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous states of the affected variables are as follows: 

- `i` is 3.
- `mask` is the next value in the range.
- The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` suggests that we are toggling the j-th bit of `mask`.

Since `j` is 2, we will compute `1 << j`, which equals 4 (binary `100`), and then apply the XOR operation with `mask`. 

The value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` is accessed, and this will depend on the specific current value of `mask`. However, the exact value of `dp[i][mask]` after the operation cannot be determined without specific values for `dp` at those indices and the `mask`.

Given the constraints and assuming `mask` is valid, we can summarize the effect of this operation:

- `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the previous state `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updates to the dp table without specific values:

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `mask` is the next value in the range.**
