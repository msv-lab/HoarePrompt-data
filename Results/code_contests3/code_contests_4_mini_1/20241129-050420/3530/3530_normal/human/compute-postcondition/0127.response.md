Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `dp[3][1]` is updated based on the conditions checked across all indices from 0 to `n-1` in the array `a`. The value of `dp[3][1]` contains the accumulated values derived from `dp[2][mask ^ (1 << j)]` for each `j` where `a[2][j]` is 1 and `mask` & (1 << j) evaluates to true. If no conditions were met during the loop execution, `dp[3][1]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
