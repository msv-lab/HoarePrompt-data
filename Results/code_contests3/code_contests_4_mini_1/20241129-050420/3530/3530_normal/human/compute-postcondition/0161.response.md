The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. The parameter `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 21 \). The parameter `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions \( N \times N \). 

Based on the provided output, the function processes these inputs and has specific return cases. However, the output details regarding the return value were not provided, so I will not make assumptions about the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (with dimensions N x N) where each element is either 0 or 1.**
