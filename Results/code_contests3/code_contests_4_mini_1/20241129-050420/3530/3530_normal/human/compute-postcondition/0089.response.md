The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when it is divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` was already affected by `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but the exact value of `dp[i][mask]` before this operation is not specified. The other variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` do not change with this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the previous value modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the previous value modulo `MOD`.**
