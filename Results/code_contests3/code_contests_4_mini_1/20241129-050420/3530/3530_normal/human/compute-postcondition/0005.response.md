According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute as long as the number of iterations has not yet reached `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. Since the loop variable `_` is not explicitly tracked, we can infer that it represents the current iteration count, which will increase by 1 for the next iteration.

Since we need to execute the loop one more time, the current iteration count must be less than `N`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the iteration count must be at least `N - 1` (i.e., the loop has executed a total of `N - 1` times so far).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than the current iteration count, which is at least `N - 1`.**
