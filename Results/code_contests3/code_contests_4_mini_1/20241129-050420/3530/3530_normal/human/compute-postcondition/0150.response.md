The code modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. Given the initial state, the specific values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `mask` are known, but the actual values in the `dp` array are not provided.

Since `i` is 3 and `j` is 1, we compute `mask ^ (1 << j)` which modifies the `mask` by flipping the bit at position `j`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` increases based on the previous value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, but without specific values in `dp`, we cannot determine the exact result.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i][mask]` has changed, but we cannot provide specific numerical values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, where `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `mask` is the next value in the range.**
