According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. Additionally, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `mask` is the next value in the range, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3.**
