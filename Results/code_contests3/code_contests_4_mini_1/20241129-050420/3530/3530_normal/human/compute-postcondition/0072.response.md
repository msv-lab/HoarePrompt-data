According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` has been evaluated for values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), and `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
