According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. 

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented to 2. Additionally, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute for the third time.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2**
