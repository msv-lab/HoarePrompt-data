Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and `dp[i][mask]` becomes `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, no updates to `dp[i][mask]` are performed.***
