The value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This means that `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected by this operation, but they influence the new value of `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` has been updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
