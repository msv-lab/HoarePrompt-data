Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, and `j` is 4. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
