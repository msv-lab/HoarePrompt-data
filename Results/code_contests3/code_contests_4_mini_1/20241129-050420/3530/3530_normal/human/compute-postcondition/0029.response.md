According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to iterate again.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2.**
