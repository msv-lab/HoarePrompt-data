According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` was some value less than `n`, and `mask` is 1. Since we are preparing for the third execution of the loop, we need to determine the current value of `j` and increment it by 1 for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be incremented, so if `j` was less than `n` at the end of the last iteration, we can set `j` to `j + 1`. Therefore, the new state will reflect that `j` is now the next value and must be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than `n`, and `j` is now 2**
