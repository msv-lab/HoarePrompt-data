The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variable `i` is currently 2, so `i - 1` is 1. The variable `mask` is 1, and the expression `mask ^ 1 << j` will depend on the value of `j`. Given that `j` must be less than `n`, and since it is stated that `n` is at least 1, the specific value of `j` is not provided, which means we can't compute the exact result for `mask ^ 1 << j`.

However, the operation modifies `dp[i][mask]`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased based on the corresponding value from `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Since we cannot determine the exact values without knowing `j`, we state the operation performed.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]` where `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is less than `n`.**
