Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (with dimensions N x N) where each element is either 0 or 1. It calculates a dynamic programming table to determine the number of ways to select elements from the list based on the conditions in `a`, and finally prints the count of valid selections modulo `1000000007`. The function does not handle cases where the input might be invalid or where `N` does not meet the specified constraints.**
