According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is at least 3, the loop will execute at least 3 times, starting with `j` equal to 0. The current value of `i` is 3, and `mask` is 2, which seem to be relevant for the loop body but do not affect the ability of the loop to execute.

For the loop to be executed the first time, `j` must start at 0, and since `n` is at least 3, we can conclude that the loop will execute correctly.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 0**
