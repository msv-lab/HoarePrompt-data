According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. The loop will execute again if the current value of `j` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Since `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `mask` is also unchanged. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1**
