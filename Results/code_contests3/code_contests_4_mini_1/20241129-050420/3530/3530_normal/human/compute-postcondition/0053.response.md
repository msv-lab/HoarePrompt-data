The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is modified by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the previous values along with the operation performed.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
