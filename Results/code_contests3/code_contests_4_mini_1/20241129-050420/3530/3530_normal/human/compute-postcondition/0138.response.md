According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 5. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 5**
