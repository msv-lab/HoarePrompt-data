According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `n`. The loop can execute if `n` is at least 1, which is already satisfied since `n` is at least 1. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Since `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions of the array `a` and the bitwise operations, these variables do not affect the execution of the loop directly. The important part is that `j` starts from 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, the necessary states are that `j` is initialized to 0, and `n` remains at least 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
