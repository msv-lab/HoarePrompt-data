Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` has been evaluated for values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
