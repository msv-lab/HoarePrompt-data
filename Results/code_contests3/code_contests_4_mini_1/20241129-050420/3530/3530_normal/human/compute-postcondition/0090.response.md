Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now the previous value modulo `MOD`.***
