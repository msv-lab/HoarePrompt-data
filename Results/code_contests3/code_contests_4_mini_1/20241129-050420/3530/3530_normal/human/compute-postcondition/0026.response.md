The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

The variables `i`, `mask`, and `j` have the following values:
- `i` is 1
- `mask` is 1
- `j` is 1

The operation involves:
- Calculating `mask ^ 1 << j`: 
  - `1 << j` shifts the bit `1` to the left by `j` positions, resulting in `2` (since `1 << 1` is `2`).
  - `mask ^ 2` is `1 ^ 2`, which is `3` (in binary, `01 ^ 10` gives `11`).

Thus, the code modifies `dp[i][mask]` using the value from `dp[0][3]` (since `i - 1` is `0` and `mask ^ 1 << j` equals `3`).

The output state therefore is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[0][3]`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[0][3]`.**
