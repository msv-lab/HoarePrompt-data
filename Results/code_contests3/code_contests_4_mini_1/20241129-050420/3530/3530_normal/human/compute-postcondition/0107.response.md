The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from a different index in the `dp` array. Specifically, it adds the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

To analyze the impact:
- The variable `i` is 2, so `i - 1` becomes 1.
- The variable `mask` is 2, and `j` is also 2.
- The expression `1 << j` shifts the number 1 left by `j` bits, which means `1 << 2` equals 4.
- The bitwise XOR operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes `2 ^ 4`. In binary, `2` is `10` and `4` is `100`. The result of `2 ^ 4` is `6` (which is `110` in binary).

Thus, the code effectively updates `dp[2][2]` by adding the value of `dp[1][6]` to it.

The output state does not change the values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, or `j`, but it calculates the new value for `dp[i][mask]`. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `mask` is 2; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[1][6]` to it.**
