According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again for the next value of `j` as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` would be at its current value which is less than `n`. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.

Given that `n` is at least 3 and `i` is 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next index, which will be 4 (since `j` starts at 0). The loop will continue executing as long as `j` remains less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` is 4 and must be less than `n` (which is at least 5)**
