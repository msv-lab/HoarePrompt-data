Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions of the array `a` and the bitwise operations with `mask` after iterating through all indices in the range. Additionally, the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise operation `mask & 1 << j` is true, indicating that the j-th bit of `mask` is set.***
