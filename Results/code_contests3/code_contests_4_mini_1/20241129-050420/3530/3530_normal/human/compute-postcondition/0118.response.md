Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & (1 << j) evaluates to true, then `dp[3][1]` has been updated and is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[3][1]`.***
