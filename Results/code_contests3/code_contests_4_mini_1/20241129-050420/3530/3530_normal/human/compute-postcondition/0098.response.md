Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, and `dp[2][mask]` is updated based on the conditions met during the loop iterations. The `i-1`th element of array `a` at index `j` is equal to 1, and the `mask` has the jth bit set (mask & 1 << j is true).***
