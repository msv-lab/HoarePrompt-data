According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range of `n`, which means it will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, and the loop will not execute again since `j` is not less than `n`. 

To execute for one more time, `j` must be incremented and less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` should be equal to `n` and the previous iteration must be considered. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a third time `j` must be less than `n` (j = n)**.
