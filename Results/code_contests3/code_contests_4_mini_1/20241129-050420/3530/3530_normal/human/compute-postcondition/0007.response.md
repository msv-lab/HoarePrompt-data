According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute as long as the iterator variable `_` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. Since the loop has executed once, the iterator variable `_` has been incremented by 1. 

If the loop is to execute one more time, then `_` must be less than `N`. After the last iteration, `_` is 1 (assuming it started at 0), so for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `_` will be 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute a second time `_` must be less than `N`, and `_` will be 2**
