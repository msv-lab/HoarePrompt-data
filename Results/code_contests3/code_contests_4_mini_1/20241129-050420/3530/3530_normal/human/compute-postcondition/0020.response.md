According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since the state indicates that `n` is at least 1, it is valid for the loop to execute. The variable `j` will start at 0 for the first iteration, as the `range(n)` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

The current values are: `N` is a positive integer within the specified range, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `mask` is 1. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized properly, which it will be as it starts from 0. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
