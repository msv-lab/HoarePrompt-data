The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

In this scenario:
- `i` is 3.
- `mask` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- We know that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` (which is 2, or `10` in binary) and `1 << j` (which is `1 << 0` or `1`, equivalent to `01` in binary) is non-zero.

The operation performed is as follows:
- `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to `2 ^ 1`, which results in `3` (or `11` in binary).
- Therefore, the index we are accessing is `dp[i - 1][3]`.

The value of `dp[i][mask]` at index `mask` (which is 2) will be incremented by the value found at `dp[i - 1][3]`.

Assuming the variables `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are defined, and since they are not specified, we can only describe the impact without specific numeric values.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to it, where `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0.**
