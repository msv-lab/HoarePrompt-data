According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, after this iteration, `j` will be 1. The loop can execute again since `n` is at least 3, which is greater than `j`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 3.**
