According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop variable `i` is currently 0, and since the loop is defined to iterate over the range of `1 << n` (which is equivalent to \(2^n\)), it can execute as long as `i` is less than \(2^n\). 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < (1 << n)`. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now 1.

Additionally, since `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), we need to ensure that `n` is defined correctly to maintain the range for \(1 << n\).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list containing `n` rows of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `_` is `n-1` if `n` > 0, otherwise `_` is -1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `1 << n` (which is 2^n).**
