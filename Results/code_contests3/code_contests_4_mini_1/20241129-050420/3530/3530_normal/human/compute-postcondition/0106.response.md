According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range defined by `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` will become 2. Also, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to be able to execute beyond `j = 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2; `mask` is 2; `j` is 2.**
