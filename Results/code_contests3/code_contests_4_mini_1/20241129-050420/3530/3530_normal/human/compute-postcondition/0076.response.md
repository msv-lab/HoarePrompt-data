According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2 because the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mask` has been evaluated for values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), and `j` is 2.**
