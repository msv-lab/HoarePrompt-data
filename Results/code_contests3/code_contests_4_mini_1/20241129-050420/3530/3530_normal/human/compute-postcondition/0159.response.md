Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `mask` has been evaluated for all values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions checked across all indices `j` from 0 to `n-1` in the array `a`, and the values are taken modulo `MOD`.**
