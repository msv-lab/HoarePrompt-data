Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to it and taking the result modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
