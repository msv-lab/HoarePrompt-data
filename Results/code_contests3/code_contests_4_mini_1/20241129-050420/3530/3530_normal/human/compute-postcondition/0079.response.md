Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mask` has been evaluated for values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `dp[i][mask]`.***
