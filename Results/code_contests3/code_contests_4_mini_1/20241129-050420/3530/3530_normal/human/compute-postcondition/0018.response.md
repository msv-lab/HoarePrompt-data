According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is structured to run from `i = 1` to `i = n`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1.

Given the conditions that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, we can infer that `n` must also be at least 1 for the loop to run. Furthermore, the variable `i` will start from 1 when the loop is executed.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need `n` to be at least 1, and `i` will be 1 on the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
