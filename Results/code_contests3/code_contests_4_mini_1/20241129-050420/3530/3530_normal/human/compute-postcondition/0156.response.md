Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, and `mask` is the next value in the range. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to the values.***
