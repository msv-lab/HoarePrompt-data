Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `mask` is the next value in the range. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, and `dp[i][mask]` is increased by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1]`.***
