The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

To analyze the situation:
- `i` is 1, meaning we are currently working on the first row of the `dp` array.
- `mask` is 2, which is represented in binary as `10`.
- `j` is 2, and `1 << j` results in `4` (or `100` in binary).
- Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `2 ^ 4`, which results in `6` (or `110` in binary).

Since the exact values of `dp` are not provided, we can state that `dp[1][2]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[0][6]` to it. However, without knowing the value of `dp[0][6]`, we cannot determine the new value of `dp[1][2]`.

Thus, the output state would reflect the operation that has occurred without specifying the final numerical result:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
