Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` has been evaluated for all values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), `j` has iterated through all indices from 0 to `n-1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions checked across all indices and masks.**
