Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `mask` is the next value in the range. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`.***
