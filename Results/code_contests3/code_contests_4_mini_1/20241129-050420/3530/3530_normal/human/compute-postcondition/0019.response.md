According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to execute over the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (i.e., \(1 << n\)), which means that for the loop to execute at least once, \(n\) must be at least 1. Given that `n` is already at least 1, the loop will execute provided that the current value of `mask` can start from 1.

At the beginning of the loop, `mask` will take the value of 1, which is the first value in the specified range. Therefore, all required states are already aligned for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1**
