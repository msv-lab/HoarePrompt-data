The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the `dp` array. Here, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0. 

1. The expression `1 << j` computes to `1 << 0`, which is `1`.
2. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes to `1 ^ 1`, which results in `0`.
3. Therefore, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][0]` to it. 

However, the exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][0]` are not provided, so we can't compute a specific numeric value. Therefore, we can only note that the value at `dp[i][mask]` will be increased by the value at `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, where `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 0.**
