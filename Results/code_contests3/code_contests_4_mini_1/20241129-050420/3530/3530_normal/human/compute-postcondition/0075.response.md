Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` has been evaluated for values from 1 to \( 2^n - 1 \), and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the range 0 to `MOD - 1` after the modulo operation.***
