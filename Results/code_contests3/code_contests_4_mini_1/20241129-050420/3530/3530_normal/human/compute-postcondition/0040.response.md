According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again for the second time. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
