Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 6, `i` is 3, `j` is 5. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise ANDed with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is modified by taking its value modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no modification to `dp[i][mask]`.***
