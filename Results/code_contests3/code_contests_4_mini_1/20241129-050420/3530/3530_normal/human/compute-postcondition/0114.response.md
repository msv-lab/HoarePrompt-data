According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute, and `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 3 and `mask` is 1, meaning that the program state is ready for the loop to execute its first iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` will have iterated through all indices from 0 to `n-1`. 

However, since the loop has not yet started, `j` must be initialized to 0 for the first execution of the loop. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
