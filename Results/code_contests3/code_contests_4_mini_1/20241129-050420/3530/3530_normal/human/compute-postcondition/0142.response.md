Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions checked for all indices `j` from 0 to `n-1` in the array `a`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` will contain the sum of all relevant `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values taken modulo `MOD`. If no conditions are met across all iterations, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
