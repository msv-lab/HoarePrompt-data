Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, and `j` is `n`. If the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the condition `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[2][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
