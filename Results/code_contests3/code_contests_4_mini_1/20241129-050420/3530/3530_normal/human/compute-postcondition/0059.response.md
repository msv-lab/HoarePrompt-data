According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. In the current state, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 1, the next value of `j` will be 2. For the loop to execute once more, `n` must be at least 3 (to ensure that `j` remains less than `n`).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2**
