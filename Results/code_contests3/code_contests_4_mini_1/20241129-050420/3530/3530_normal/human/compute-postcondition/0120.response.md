To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we need to analyze the code snippet in the context of the initial state.

The snippet is:
```
dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
```

**Analysis:**
- `i` is currently 3.
- `mask` is currently 1.
- `j` is currently 1.
- The operation performed is updating `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`.
- The expression `1 << j` shifts the number 1 to the left by `j` positions. Since `j` is 1, `1 << 1` equals 2. Thus, `mask ^ 1 << j` translates to `mask ^ 2`, which calculates to `1 ^ 2 = 3` (binary 01 XOR 10 = 11).

This means that `dp[3][1]` will be updated by adding the value of `dp[2][3]`. 

**Impact on Variables:**
- `dp[i][mask]` is modified (the specific value depends on the existing values in the array, which are not provided).
- Other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`) remain unchanged.

Given that we don't have the specific values of the `dp` array, we can only describe the state in terms of what happens to `dp[3][1]`.

**Output State:**
Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; `dp[3][1]` is updated by adding `dp[2][3]`.**
