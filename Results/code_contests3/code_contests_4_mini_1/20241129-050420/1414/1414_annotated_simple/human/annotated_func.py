#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is less than or equal to 0, `res` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is the input integer, and `v` is the input integer.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, which represent the maximum number of sections in a box, the number of nuts, the number of divisors, and the capacity of each section, respectively. It calculates how many iterations are needed to distribute the nuts into the sections based on the available divisors and sections until all nuts are distributed (a ≤ 0). The function returns the total number of iterations needed to distribute the nuts. It does not handle cases where distribution is not possible; it simply continues until all nuts are accounted for, regardless of the constraints on sections and divisors.
