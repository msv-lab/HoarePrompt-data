The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `res` is 0, so after execution, `res` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is assigned an input integer, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is assigned an input integer, `v` is assigned an input integer, `res` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is assigned an input integer, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is assigned an input integer, `v` is assigned an input integer, `res` is 1**
