Postcondition: ***`k` is an input integer, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is reduced by (k - 1), and `res` remains 1. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated to `a - v` while `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v` and `b` is less than or equal to 0.***
