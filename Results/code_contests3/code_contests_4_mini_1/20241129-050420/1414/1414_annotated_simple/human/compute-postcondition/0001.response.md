The variable `res` is initialized to 0. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` remain unchanged since they are only input integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is assigned an input integer, `v` is assigned an input integer, and `res` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is assigned an input integer, `v` is assigned an input integer, and `res` is 0**.
