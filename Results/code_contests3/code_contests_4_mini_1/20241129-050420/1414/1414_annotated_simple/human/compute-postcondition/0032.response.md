Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by (k - 1), `res` is increased by 1, and `a` is updated to `a - k * v`. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` remains an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `res` is increased by 1.***
