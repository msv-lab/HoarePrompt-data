The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`. This updates the previous input integer value of `b` to `0`. The other variables `a`, `v`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is greater than 0; `b` is 0; `v` is an input integer; `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0; `b` is 0; `v` is an input integer; `res` is increased by 1**
