The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned based on the input provided by `raw_input()`, which accepts space-separated integers and converts them to a list. Each of these variables will hold a specific integer value that is inputted by the user. The previous values are not known as they are being replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that new values have been assigned to `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`.

Output State: **`k` is assigned an input integer, `a` is assigned an input integer, `b` is assigned an input integer, `v` is assigned an input integer**
