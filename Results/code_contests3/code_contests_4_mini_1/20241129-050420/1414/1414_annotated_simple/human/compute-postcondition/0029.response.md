The value of `b` is assigned the integer 0, which directly affects the previous value of `a` in the expression `a - (b + 1) * v`. Since `b` is now 0, the expression simplifies to `a - (0 + 1) * v`, which is `a - v`. The variable `a` is still greater than 0 and is not changed directly by this assignment. Therefore, the previous values of `a`, `v`, and the updated value of `b` will reflect in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - v`, `b` is 0, `v` is an input integer.**
