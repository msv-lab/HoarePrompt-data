The value of `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`. The previous value of `b` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the new value of `b` will be equal to the previous value minus `(k - 1)`. The values of `a`, `v`, and `res` are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is an input integer minus (k - 1), `v` is an input integer, `res` is 1.**
