The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output, the function calculates whether it is possible to distribute a given number of nuts into a specified number of sections within the constraints of the number of divisors and the capacity of each section. 

The function returns:
- Case_1: If the number of nuts exceeds the total capacity of all sections, it returns an error message indicating that the distribution is not possible.
- Case_2: If the distribution is feasible based on the given parameters, it returns a success message confirming the distribution.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to evaluate the distribution of nuts into sections of a box given certain constraints, returning either an error message or a success message based on the feasibility of the distribution. 

Functionality: **The function evaluates the distribution of nuts into sections of a box based on specified constraints and returns an error message if distribution is not possible or a success message if it is feasible.**
