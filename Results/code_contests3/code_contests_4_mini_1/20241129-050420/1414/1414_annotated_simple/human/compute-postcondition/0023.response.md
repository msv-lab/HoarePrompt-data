Postcondition: ***`k` is an input integer, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)` and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is less than `k`, `res` is increased by 1 regardless of whether `b` is positive, zero, or negative, and if `b` is negative, `a` is decreased by `v`.***
