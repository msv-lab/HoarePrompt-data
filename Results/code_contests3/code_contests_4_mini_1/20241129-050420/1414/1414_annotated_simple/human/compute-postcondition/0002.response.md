According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `a` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `a` needs to be adjusted to a value greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`k` is assigned an input integer, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is assigned an input integer, `v` is assigned an input integer, and `res` is 0**
