Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `res` has been incremented by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is less than its previous value but remains greater than 0, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1). Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is reduced by (b + 1) * v and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is not greater than 0, then `a` remains greater than 0 after being decremented by `v`.***
