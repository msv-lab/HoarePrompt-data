The value of `b` is decremented by the value of `(k - 1)`. Since `k` is greater than 0, `(k - 1)` is a non-negative value, which means `b` will decrease but remains unchanged in terms of being a valid number. The values of `a` and `res` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0, `a` is now less than its previous value but must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, `res` has been incremented by 1, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1).

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `a` is now less than its previous value but must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, `res` has been incremented by 1, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1)**
