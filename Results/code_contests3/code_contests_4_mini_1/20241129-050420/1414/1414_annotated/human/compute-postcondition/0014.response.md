Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, `v`, `res` are integers with 2 ≤ k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ v ≤ 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by at least 1, and `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than `k`, and greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0, while `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` remains in the range (1 ≤ a - v ≤ 1000) and `b` is in the range (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) with `b` also being less than `k`, and `res` remains 1.***
