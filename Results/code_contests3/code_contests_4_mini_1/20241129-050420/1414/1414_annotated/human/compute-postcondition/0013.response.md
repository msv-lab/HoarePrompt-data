Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), if `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0, while `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, then `a` remains in the range (1 ≤ a - v ≤ 1000) while `b` is also in the range (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `b` is less than `k`, with `res` remaining 1.***
