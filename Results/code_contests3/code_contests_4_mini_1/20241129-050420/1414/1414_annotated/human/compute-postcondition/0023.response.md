Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, if `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by `k - 1`, and `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a` is greater than 0 after decrementing by either `(b + 1) * v` if `b` > 0 or by `v` if `b` is 0, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1.***
