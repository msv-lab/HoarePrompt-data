#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the number of times the loop executed, with `k` remaining unchanged, and `v` also remaining unchanged.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers: `k` (the maximum number of sections in a box), `a` (the number of nuts), `b` (the number of divisors), and `v` (the capacity of each section of the box). It calculates the number of iterations required to reduce the number of nuts `a` to zero, based on the available sections and divisors. The function does not handle cases where `a` is initially zero or negative, which suggests a potential edge case not covered in the annotations. The output is the number of iterations printed to the console, which indicates how many times the loop was executed until all nuts were processed.
