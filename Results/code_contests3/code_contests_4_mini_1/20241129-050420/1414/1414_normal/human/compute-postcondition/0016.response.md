The value of `res` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `res` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`k`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is a positive integer, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is a positive integer, and `res` is increased by 1.**
