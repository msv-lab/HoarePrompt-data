Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `a` and `b` are positive integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v` and `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, while `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than `k`, and if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0; otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` remains 1.***
