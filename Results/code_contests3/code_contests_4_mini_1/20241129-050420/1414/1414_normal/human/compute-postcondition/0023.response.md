Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `(b + 1) * v`, `b` is set to 0 if it is greater than 0, and `res` is increased by 1. In the case where `b` is not greater than 0, `a` remains greater than 0 minus `v`, and `b` is a positive integer.***
