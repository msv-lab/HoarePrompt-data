The value of `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`. The previous value of `b` is a positive integer, and since `k` is between 2 and 1000, `(k - 1)` is at least 1. Therefore, the new value of `b` will still be a positive integer after the operation. The states of `k`, `a`, and `res` are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `k` is between 2 and 1000, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is a positive integer decreased by `(k - 1)`, `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is between 2 and 1000, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `b` is a positive integer decreased by `(k - 1)`, `res` is increased by 1.**
