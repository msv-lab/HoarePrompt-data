Output State: **`a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the total number of iterations executed, which depends on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `k`. If `a` was sufficiently large relative to `b` and `k`, then `res` counts how many times the loop could execute based on the decrement conditions applied to `a` and `b`.**
