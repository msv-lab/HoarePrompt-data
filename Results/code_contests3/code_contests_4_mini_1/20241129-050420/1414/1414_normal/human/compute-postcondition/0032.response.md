Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `b` is a positive integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by (k - 1), `a` is decreased by `k * v`, and `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v; if `b` is 0, `a` is decreased by v, and `res` is increased by 1.***
