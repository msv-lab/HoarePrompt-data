The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which is expected to be a single character, and returns True if `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., not one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If `ch` is a vowel, it returns False. The function does not enforce that `ch` is a single character, so passing a longer string could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, it assumes that the input consists only of lowercase English letters.
