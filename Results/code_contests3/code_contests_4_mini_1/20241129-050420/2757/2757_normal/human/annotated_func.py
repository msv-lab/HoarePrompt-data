#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if the character 'ch' is not a vowel (not in 'aeiou'), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch`, which is expected to be a single character, and returns True if `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., not one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If `ch` is a vowel, it returns False. The function does not enforce that `ch` is a single character, so passing a longer string could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, it assumes that the input consists only of lowercase English letters.
