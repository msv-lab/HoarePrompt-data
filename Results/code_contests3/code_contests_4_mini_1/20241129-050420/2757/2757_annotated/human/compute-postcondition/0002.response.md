The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `ch`, which is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters. The function checks if `ch` is not one of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). If `ch` is a consonant, the function returns `True`, while if it is a vowel, it returns `False`. However, since `ch` is specified to be a single character string (as per the context), the function does not handle cases where the input might be more than one character or an invalid character. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine if the character is a consonant or a vowel, but it assumes `ch` is always a valid single lowercase letter. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of a single lowercase English letter and returns True if `ch` is a consonant and False if `ch` is a vowel. It does not handle cases where `ch` is not a single lowercase letter. **
