#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'ch' is a consonant (not in 'aeiou') and False if 'ch' is a vowel.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of a single lowercase English letter and returns True if `ch` is a consonant and False if `ch` is a vowel. It does not handle cases where `ch` is not a single lowercase letter.
