#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters, with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'ch' is not a vowel (not in 'aeiou') and False if 'ch' is a vowel.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns True if `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., if `ch` is one of the consonants); if `ch` is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `ch` has a length greater than 1, as it only checks the presence of the entire string in the vowel set. Therefore, if `ch` is a multi-character string, the behavior is not defined based on the current implementation.
