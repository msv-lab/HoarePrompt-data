Correctness: **False**

The provided program only defines a function `func_1` that checks if a single character is a consonant or not. It returns `True` if the character is not a vowel (i.e., it is a consonant) and `False` if it is a vowel. However, this is insufficient to meet the requirements of the problem description, which involves detecting words with typos based on the presence of three or more consecutive consonants, while also considering exceptions for blocks of identical consonants.

The program does not:
1. Analyze the entire word to check for groups of three or more consonants.
2. Check if such groups contain at least two different consonants.
3. Insert spaces in the word to eliminate typos as specified in the problem description.

Hence, the function does not accomplish the necessary task of identifying and correcting typos in a word based on the specified criteria. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description.
