Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of lowercase English letters and returns True if `ch` is not a vowel (i.e., if `ch` is one of the consonants); if `ch` is a vowel (i.e., one of 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'), it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `ch` has a length greater than 1, as it only checks the presence of the entire string in the vowel set. Therefore, if `ch` is a multi-character string, the behavior is not defined based on the current implementation.**
