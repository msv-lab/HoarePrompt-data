The value of `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The other variables, `N` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 1, `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 1, `result` is increased by 1**
