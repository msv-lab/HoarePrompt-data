The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, but the specific value of `N` is not provided. The string `S` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**
