According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, it must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**.
