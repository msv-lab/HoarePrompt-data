Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the result based on the counts of 'I' and 'D' in the string, where each 'I' increments the result by 1 and each 'D' decrements it by 1. Finally, if the result is negative, it sets the result to 0 before printing it. The function does not return any value, but prints the final result. **
