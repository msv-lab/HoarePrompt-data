The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is not given, so we cannot determine its specific value after the operation. The states of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
