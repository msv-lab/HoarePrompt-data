According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `i` which starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Since `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1, which it is because `N` can be any integer from 1 to 100.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than or equal to 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than or equal to 2**
