The value of `result` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but it is affected by this operation. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, and the first element of the array `S` at index `i` is not 'I', which also remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 0, and `result` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `i` is 0, and `result` is decremented by 1.**
