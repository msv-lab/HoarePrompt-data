The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `S`. `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. The function processes these inputs and returns a sequence of integers based on the instructions encoded in the string `S`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D', and it returns a sequence of integers based on the characters in `S`.**
