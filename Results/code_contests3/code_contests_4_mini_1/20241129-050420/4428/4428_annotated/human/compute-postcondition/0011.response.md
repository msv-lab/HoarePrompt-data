The operation `result -= 1` decreases the value of `result` by 1. The variable `result` is affected, but the values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged. Since `N` is a positive integer and the condition for the loop to execute a second time is still valid, we can state the output accordingly.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `result` is decreased by 1**
