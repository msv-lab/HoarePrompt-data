The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, the new value of `N` will be an integer input from the user. The value of `S` remains unaffected as it is not involved in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer that is now assigned an input integer value; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer that is now assigned an input integer value; `S` is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**.
