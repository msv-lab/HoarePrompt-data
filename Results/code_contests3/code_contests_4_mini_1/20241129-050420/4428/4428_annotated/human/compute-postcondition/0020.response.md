Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D', and `result` is equal to the number of 'I' characters in `S` minus the number of 'D' characters in `S`. If `result` is less than 0, `result` has been updated accordingly; otherwise, `result` remains unchanged.***
