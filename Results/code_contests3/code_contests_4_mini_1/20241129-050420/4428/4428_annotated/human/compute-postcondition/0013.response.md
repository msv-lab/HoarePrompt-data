According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, if `i` is currently `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `k`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is `k`, and `N` must be greater than `k`.**
