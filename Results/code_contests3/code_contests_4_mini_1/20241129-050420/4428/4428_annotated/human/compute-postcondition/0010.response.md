`result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is not specified, but it will now be one greater than that value. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is `i + 1`, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is `i + 1`, and `result` is increased by 1**
