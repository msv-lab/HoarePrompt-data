According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is a positive integer, and since `i` is currently at its last value, it must be less than `N` for the loop to run one more time. 

Assuming `i` was the last value in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented by 1. Thus, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 1` and `i` is `i + 1`**
