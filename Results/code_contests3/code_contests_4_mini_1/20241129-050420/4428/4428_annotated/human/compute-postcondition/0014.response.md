The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is `k`, with the condition that `N` must be greater than `k`. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer, `i` is `k`, `result` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `i` is `k`, `result` is incremented by 1.**
