The function accepts a positive integer `N` representing the length of a string and a string `S` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the result as the number of 'I' characters minus the number of 'D' characters in `S`. If the result is negative, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns the calculated result. The function does not return a value but prints the result.
