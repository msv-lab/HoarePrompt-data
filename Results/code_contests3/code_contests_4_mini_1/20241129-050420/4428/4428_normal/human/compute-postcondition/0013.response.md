According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than 1. Additionally, `i` will be increased by 1 for the next iteration, so it will be 2.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` â‰¤ 100, `i` is 2**
