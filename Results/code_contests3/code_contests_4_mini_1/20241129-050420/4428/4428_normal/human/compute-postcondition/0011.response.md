The line `result -= 1` decrements the value of `result` by 1. The initial state does not specify the value of `result`, but since it is not affected by the provided code snippet, we cannot determine its value. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `result` has been decreased by 1, while `N` and `i` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is 1; `result` is decreased by 1.**
