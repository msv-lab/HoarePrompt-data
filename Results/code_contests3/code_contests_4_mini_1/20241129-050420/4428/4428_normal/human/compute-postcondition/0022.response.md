The function `func` does not take any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the definition. However, it operates based on two constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer with a value between 1 and 100, and `S`, which is a string of length `N` containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. 

The output of the function is dependent on the input values. Given these constraints, the function returns a specific arrangement of numbers based on the sequence represented by the string `S`, where 'I' indicates an increase and 'D' indicates a decrease in the numerical sequence.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N and a string S of length N, returning a sequence of numbers based on the characters 'I' and 'D' in S.**
