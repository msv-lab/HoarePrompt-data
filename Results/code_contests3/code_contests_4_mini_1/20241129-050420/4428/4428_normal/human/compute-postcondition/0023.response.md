The function `func` accepts a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It iterates through the string and calculates a result by incrementing for each 'I' and decrementing for each 'D'. After processing the entire string, if the resulting value is negative, it is reset to zero before being printed. The function does not return any value but outputs the final result. 

Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `N` and a string `S` of length `N`, counts the net number of 'I' characters minus 'D' characters, ensures the result is not negative by resetting it to zero if necessary, and prints the final result. **
