`result` is decremented by 1, and since the initial value of `result` is 0, after execution, `result` becomes -1. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `S[i]` not being 'I' does not affect the output state. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the value of `S[i]` is not 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is -1, `i` is 0, and the value of `S[i]` is not 'I'**.
