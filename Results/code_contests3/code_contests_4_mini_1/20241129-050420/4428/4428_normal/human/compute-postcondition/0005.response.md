`result` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `result` becomes 1. The states of the other variables `N`, `i`, and `S` remain unaffected. Thus, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the first element of `S` at index `i` is 'I'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `result` is 1, `i` is 0, and the first element of `S` at index `i` is 'I'**.
