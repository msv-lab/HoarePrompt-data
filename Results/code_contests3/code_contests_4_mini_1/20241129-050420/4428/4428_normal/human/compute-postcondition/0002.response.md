The variable `result` is initialized to 0. The values of `N` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is an input string of length `N` containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'; `result` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is an input string of length `N` containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'; `result` is 0**.
