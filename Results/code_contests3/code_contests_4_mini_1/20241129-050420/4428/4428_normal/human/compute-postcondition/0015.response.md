The code `result -= 1` decreases the value of `result` by 1. However, the initial value of `result` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables, `N` and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
