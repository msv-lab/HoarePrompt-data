The `result` variable is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a non-negative integer since it typically starts at 0 in such contexts. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `result` has been increased by 1, and the values of `N` and `i` are unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 1, `result` is increased by 1**
