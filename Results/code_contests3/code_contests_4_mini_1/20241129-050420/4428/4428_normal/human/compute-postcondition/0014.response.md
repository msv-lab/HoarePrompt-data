The value of `result` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is unknown. The other variables `N` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 < `N` ≤ 100, `i` is 2, and `result` is increased by 1.**
