Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem description specifies that the input consists of arithmetic expressions of the form `(a+b)/c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers. However, the program reads input as floating-point numbers directly without evaluating the arithmetic expression. This means that the program does not process the expressions in the required format.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program fails to evaluate the arithmetic expressions. The expressions must be computed to derive the actual coordinates to which each ship will jump. The program merely counts the number of occurrences of the input as floating-point numbers, which is not what is required.

3. **Count Logic**: The counting mechanism in the second loop uses `test_list.count(i)`, which counts how many times each unique floating-point number appears in the list. However, since the inputs were supposed to be the results of evaluating expressions, this logic is flawed as it does not reflect the proper counts of ships jumping to the same coordinate based on the evaluated results.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described, as it does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions, leading to incorrect handling of inputs and outputs.
