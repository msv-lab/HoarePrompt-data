The function accepts an integer `m` from user input, which represents the number of subsequent lines containing valid floating-point numbers. It collects these numbers into a list and then counts the occurrences of each number in the list. Finally, it prints the counts of each number corresponding to their order of appearance, separated by spaces. However, the function does not evaluate any arithmetic expressions as suggested by the comments. Instead, it simply counts and displays the frequency of each input number.
