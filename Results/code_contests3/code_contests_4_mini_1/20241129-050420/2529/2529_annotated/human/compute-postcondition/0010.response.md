`test_list` is appended with the value of `e`, which is a floating-point number from input. The variable `m` remains unchanged within the context of this code, and `i` also stays the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 < `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number from input, and `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 < `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number from input, and `test_list` contains the floating-point number `e`.**
