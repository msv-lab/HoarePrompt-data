The code takes `my_list`, converts each element to a string using `map(str, my_list)`, and then joins these string elements with a space in between using `' '.join(...)`. The value of `m` does not affect the output directly, as the focus is on printing `my_list`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the contents of `my_list` as a string. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `my_list` is printed as a space-separated string of its elements.**
