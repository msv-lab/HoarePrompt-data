The code `my_list.append(test_list.count(i))` appends the count of occurrences of the variable `i` in the list `test_list` to `my_list`. The variable `i` is the second element of `test_list`, and since the loop executes a second time, `test_list` must have at least 2 elements. Therefore, `test_list.count(i)` will return the count of how many times the value of `i` appears in `test_list`. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code.
- `i` is the second element of `test_list`.
- `my_list` will have its state changed by appending the count of `i` in `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `i` is the second element of `test_list`; `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
