According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. If the list has more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `test_list`, which means it is at index 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `test_list` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` should be updated to the third element of `test_list`.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `i` is the third element of `test_list`, for the loop to execute a third time `test_list` must have at least 3 elements.**
