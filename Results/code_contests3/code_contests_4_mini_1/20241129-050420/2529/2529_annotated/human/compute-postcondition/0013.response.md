According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `test_list`. For the loop to execute, `test_list` must contain at least 1 element, meaning that `m` should be at least 1. Given that `m` is defined to be at least 1, this condition is satisfied. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will take on the value of the first element in `test_list`, which is `test_list[0]`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be set to `test_list[0]`.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is the first element of test_list, `e` is the last floating-point number input, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, `my_list` is an empty list**
