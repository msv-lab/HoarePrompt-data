The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `e` is a floating-point number from input, and `m` and `i` are unaffected by this operation. The value of `test_list` will now include the floating-point number `e`. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 1, `e` is a floating-point number from input, `test_list` now includes `e`.**
