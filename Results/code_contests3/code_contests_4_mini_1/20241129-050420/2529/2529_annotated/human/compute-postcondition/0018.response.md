The code snippet appends the count of the element `i` from `test_list` to `my_list`. The values of `m` and `i` are not directly modified, but the state of `my_list` will be impacted by the count of `i` in `test_list`. Since `i` is the third element of `test_list`, and we assume `test_list` has at least 3 elements, we can determine the count.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `i` is the third element of `test_list`; `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
