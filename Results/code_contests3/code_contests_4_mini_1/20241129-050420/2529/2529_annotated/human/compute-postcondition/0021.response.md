The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes a series of arithmetic expressions provided in the input. Each expression is of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers. The function evaluates these expressions and returns the results. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to evaluate a series of arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c and return the computed results for each expression. 

Functionality: **The function evaluates a series of arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers, and returns the computed results for each expression.**
