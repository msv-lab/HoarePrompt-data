In this case, `test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The value of `m` is not affected by this operation, and there are no computations or modifications to `m`. Therefore, the output state is simply the initialization of `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `test_list` is an empty list**
