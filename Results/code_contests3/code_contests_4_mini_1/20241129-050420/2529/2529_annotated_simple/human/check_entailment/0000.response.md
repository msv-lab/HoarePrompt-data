Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input as floating-point numbers directly with `float(input())`, but the jump coordinates are given as arithmetic expressions in the form `(a+b)/c`. The program fails to parse the expressions properly. Instead, it should evaluate the arithmetic expression using either `eval()` or a custom parser to compute the correct value of the expression.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: As mentioned, the input is expected to be in a specific format which includes parentheses and operators. The program fails to correctly interpret and calculate values from the expressions provided as input, which means the coordinates it processes are incorrect.

3. **Counting Coordinates**: The program uses `test_list.count(i)` to count occurrences of each coordinate. While this approach would work if the coordinates were correctly calculated, since they are not, the results will be incorrect.

4. **Handling of Input Constraints**: The program assumes the input will always be valid and does not handle any potential input errors or variations, which is important for robustness given the range of inputs specified in the problem.

In summary, due to the incorrect input parsing and evaluation of the jump coordinates, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to incorrect outputs.
