To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the loop code.

The loop runs `m` times, where `m` is a positive integer input by the user. In each iteration, it reads a floating-point number from the input, assigns it to `e`, and appends `e` to the `test_list`.

After all iterations:
- `m` remains as the input integer provided initially.
- `i` will be equal to `m` after the loop completes, as it increments from 0 to `m-1`.
- `test_list` will contain `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user.

If `m` is greater than 0, then `test_list` will have `m` elements. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, `i` will remain 0, and `test_list` will still be an empty list.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`m` is the input integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user.**
