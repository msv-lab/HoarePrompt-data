The variable `e` is appended to `test_list`. The value of `e` is a floating-point number input, and `test_list` was previously undefined, but it is now assumed to be initialized as an empty list. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `test_list` now contains the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, `test_list` now contains the value of `e`**
