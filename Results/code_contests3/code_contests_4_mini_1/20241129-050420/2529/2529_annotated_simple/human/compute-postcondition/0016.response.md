To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet. 

The line of code `my_list.append(test_list.count(i))` takes the following steps:

1. **`test_list.count(i)`**: This part counts how many times the value of `i` appears in the list `test_list`. The value of `i` is given as the second floating-point number in `test_list`, while `m` is an input integer. The exact value of `i` and the content of `test_list` are not specified, but we know `i` is derived from `test_list`.

2. **`my_list.append(...)`**: This takes the result of the count operation (an integer) and appends it to `my_list`. The state of `my_list` is updated to include this new count.

Since we don't have specific values for `test_list`, `i`, or `my_list`, we can only describe the relationship and the impact of the operation.

The output state will therefore reflect the previous values and the change caused by appending the count of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is the input integer, `i` is the second floating-point number in `test_list`, `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list**.
