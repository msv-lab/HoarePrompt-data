Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and processes a positive integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) representing the number of floating-point numbers to be inputted by the user. It collects these numbers into a list and then generates a new list containing the count of each number's occurrences in the original list. Finally, it prints these counts as a space-separated string. The function does not validate the input format for floating-point numbers, which could lead to errors if the user enters invalid data. **
