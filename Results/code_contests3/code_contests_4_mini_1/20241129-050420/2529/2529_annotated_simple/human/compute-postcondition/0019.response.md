The loop iterates over each element in `test_list`, and for each element `i`, it appends the count of `i` in `test_list` to `my_list`. After all iterations, `my_list` will contain the counts of each unique element in `test_list`, with each count corresponding to the number of occurrences of the floating-point number in the original list.

If `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, then after all iterations of the loop have finished, `my_list` will have `m` elements, where each element represents the count of the corresponding element in `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is the input integer, `i` is equal to the last floating-point number in `test_list`, `my_list` contains the counts of each floating-point number in `test_list`.**
