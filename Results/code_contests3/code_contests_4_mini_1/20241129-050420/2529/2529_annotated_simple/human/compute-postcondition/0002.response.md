According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. At the start, `test_list` is empty, which does not affect the execution of the loop since the loop does not use this list. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the first time, `m` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`m` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
