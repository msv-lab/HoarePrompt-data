The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes a positive integer `m`, which must satisfy the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000. Additionally, the function evaluates jump coordinates that are defined by arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The function's output is determined based on these jump coordinates and the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `m` and evaluate jump coordinates based on arithmetic expressions, returning a result related to these evaluations.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) and evaluates jump coordinates based on arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, returning a result based on these evaluations.**
