`my_list` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `m`, `i`, and `test_list` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is the input integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, and `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is the input integer, `i` is equal to `m`, `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers inputted by the user, `my_list` is an empty list**.
