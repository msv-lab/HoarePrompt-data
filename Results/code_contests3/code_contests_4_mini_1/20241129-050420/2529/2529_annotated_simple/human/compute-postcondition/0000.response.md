The variable `m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `m` is overwritten by this new integer value. Other variables are not impacted, so the output state reflects the new assignment of `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer**
