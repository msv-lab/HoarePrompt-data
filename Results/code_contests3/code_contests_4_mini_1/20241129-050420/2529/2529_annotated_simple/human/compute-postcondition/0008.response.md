According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `m` must be greater than 2.

State: **`m` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**.
