The value of `i` is equal to the first floating-point number in `test_list`. The code `test_list.count(i)` counts how many times `i` appears in `test_list` and appends that count to `my_list`. Since `test_list` contains at least 1 floating-point number, `my_list` will be updated with the count of `i` in `test_list`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`m` is the input integer, `i` is equal to the first floating-point number in `test_list`, `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
