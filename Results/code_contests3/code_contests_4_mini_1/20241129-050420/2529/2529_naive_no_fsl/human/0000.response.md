Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not adhere to the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program attempts to read the arithmetic expressions as floats directly, which will not work correctly. The input is supposed to be in the form of expressions like `(a+b)/c`, but the code reads them as floats, which will lead to a `ValueError` when trying to read the expression without parsing it correctly.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program does not evaluate the arithmetic expressions. Instead of computing the value of each expression `(a+b)/c`, it attempts to use these expressions as float values directly, which is incorrect.

3. **Counting Logic**: The counting logic uses `test_list.count(i)` which will count occurrences of the float value `i` in the list, but since the values are not computed from the expressions, this logic will not yield the correct counts based on the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases related to invalid or unexpected input formats, such as malformed expressions or division by zero (though in the provided problem description it states that `c` will be a positive integer).

To illustrate a specific failing case:
- If the input is:
```
2
(1+1)/2
(2+2)/4
```
The expected output should be `2 2` since both expressions evaluate to `1.0`. However, the program will throw an error or produce an incorrect output as it does not properly evaluate the expressions.

Thus, due to these issues, the program is deemed incorrect.
