The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `m` from input, which specifies the number of subsequent floating-point numbers to read. It stores these numbers in a list and then counts the occurrences of each unique number in that list. Finally, it prints the counts of each number as a space-separated string. The function does not handle any edge cases related to input validation beyond the assumptions made about `m`. It also does not process any jump coordinates formatted as (a+b)/c, as suggested by the annotations; instead, it simply counts and displays occurrences of floating-point numbers.
