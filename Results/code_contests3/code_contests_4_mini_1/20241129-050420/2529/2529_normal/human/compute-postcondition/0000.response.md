The variable `m` is reassigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `m` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ m â‰¤ 200,000, the output state will reflect that `m` is now an input integer within that range. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000**
