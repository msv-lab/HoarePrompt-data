The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes a specified number of jump coordinates, where `m` is a positive integer that indicates the number of jumps to be processed. Each jump coordinate is a string formatted as (a+b)/c, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. After processing the jump coordinates, the function returns a result based on these coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes up to 200,000 jump coordinates formatted as (a+b)/c, returning a result based on these coordinates.**
