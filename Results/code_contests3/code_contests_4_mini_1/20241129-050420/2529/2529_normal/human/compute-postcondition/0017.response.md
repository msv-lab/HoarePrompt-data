According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `test_list`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `test_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `test_list` contains at least `k + 1` elements, and `my_list` has one more element which is the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `test_list` must have at least `k + 2` elements (accounting for the current iteration), and `i` will be the next element in `test_list`.

State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `my_list` has one more element which is the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`, for the loop to execute one more time `test_list` must contain at least `k + 2` elements, and `i` will be the next element in `test_list`.**
