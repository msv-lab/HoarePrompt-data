According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, it guarantees that `m` is at least 1, which means the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start from 0 on the first iteration. The state of `test_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop itself, as the loop does not rely on its contents.

State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
