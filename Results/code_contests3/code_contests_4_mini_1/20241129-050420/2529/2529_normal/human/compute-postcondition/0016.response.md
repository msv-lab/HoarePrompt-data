The value of `my_list` will be modified by appending the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list` to it. Since `test_list` contains at least `k + 1` elements, the method `count(i)` will return the number of times `i` appears in `test_list`. The values of `m` and `test_list` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `my_list` has one more element which is the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`, and `test_list` contains at least `k + 1` elements.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `my_list` has one more element which is the count of occurrences of `i` in `test_list`, and `test_list` contains at least `k + 1` elements.**
