The code `test_list.append(e)` adds the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 0, and `e` is a float input. The list `test_list` was not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it is initialized as an empty list before this operation. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now contains the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000; `i` is 0; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now contains the value of `e`.**
