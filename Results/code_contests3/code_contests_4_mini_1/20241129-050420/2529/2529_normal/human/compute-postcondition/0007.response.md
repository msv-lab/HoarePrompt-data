The code `test_list.append(e)` adds the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The initial state indicates that `e` is a floating-point number input by the user, while `m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000 and `i` is 1. The variable `test_list` is not defined in the initial state, but it will now contain the value of `e` after execution. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a floating-point number input by the user, and `test_list` now contains `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `i` is 1, `e` is a floating-point number input by the user, and `test_list` now contains `e`.**
