According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `test_list`. For the loop to execute, `test_list` must contain at least one element. Since `m` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, it implies that `test_list` will have `m` floating-point numbers, which ensures that `test_list` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute for the first time. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the value of the first element in `test_list`. Consequently, it is necessary for `i` to be set to the first element of `test_list` when the loop begins.

State: **`m` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `my_list` is initialized as an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers with at least 1 number, and `i` is the first element in `test_list`**
