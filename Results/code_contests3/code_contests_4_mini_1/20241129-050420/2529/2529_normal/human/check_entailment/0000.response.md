The provided Python program is intended to process coordinates of ships given in the form of the arithmetic expression `(a+b)/c`. However, the code reads floating-point numbers directly from input without parsing these expressions. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Input Handling**: The code does not handle the arithmetic expression format `(a+b)/c` as specified in the problem description. Instead, it takes floating-point numbers directly from input. This is a significant deviation from the requirements since it does not evaluate the expression or derive coordinates from it.
2. **Counting Logic**: The code uses `test_list.count(i)` to count occurrences of each number, which is inefficient since it checks the count for every item in the list. This does not affect correctness in terms of output, but it is worth noting for performance.

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not consider incorrect input formats or handle edge cases explicitly since it assumes valid input in the form of floating-point numbers. 
- It completely misses the requirement to compute the coordinates from the arithmetic expression.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe a function that reads floating-point numbers and counts occurrences, which aligns with the code. However, since the problem requires processing arithmetic expressions, the hints do not provide validation for the processing of input as specified. The hints confirm that the code does not meet the problem requirements because it does not perform the necessary calculations to derive coordinates from the `(a+b)/c` format.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically failing to handle the parsing and evaluation of the arithmetic expression. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not compute the jump coordinates as specified, and thus cannot provide the correct output according to the problem description.
