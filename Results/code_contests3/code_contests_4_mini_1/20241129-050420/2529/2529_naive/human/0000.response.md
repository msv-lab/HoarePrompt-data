To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to compute how many ships end up at the same hyperspace jump coordinate given in the form `(a+b)/c`. The output should be a space-separated list of counts corresponding to each ship's coordinate.

### Analyzing the Provided Program
```python
m = int(input())
test_list = []
for i in range(m):
    e = float(input())
    test_list.append(e)
my_list = []
for i in test_list:
    my_list.append(test_list.count(i))
print(' '.join(map(str, my_list)))
```

### Issues in the Program
1. **Input Processing**: The program incorrectly attempts to read the jump coordinates as `float` directly. Instead, it should parse the input expressions, compute the result of the expression `(a+b)/c`, and store the computed values.

2. **Count Logic**: The use of `test_list.count(i)` only counts occurrences of the floating-point value `i` in the list, which would not yield correct results if two different expressions result in the same float due to floating-point precision issues.

3. **Expression Parsing**: The program does not handle the parsing of the arithmetic expression `(a+b)/c`, which is essential to compute the coordinates correctly.

### Example of Failure
For input:
```
3
(1+2)/3
(2+1)/3
(3+0)/3
```
The program will output `1 1 1`, which is incorrect because the first two expressions yield the same result, `1.0`, and should count together. The expected output should be `2 2 1`.

### Conclusion
Given the identified issues and how the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem, the correctness of the program must be deemed false.

Correctness: **False**.
