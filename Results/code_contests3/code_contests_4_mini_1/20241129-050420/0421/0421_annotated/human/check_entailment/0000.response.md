Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the described algorithm for sorting the array of integers based on the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This will lead to a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Loop Logic**: The program attempts to check for pairs of consecutive integers with an absolute difference of 2 or more. However, it does this check only once for the entire array before removing elements. According to the problem description, this check should be performed continuously as stacks are removed, not just before any operations are performed. 

3. **Removal of Maximum**: The program removes the maximum number from the list without ensuring that the tallest stack is indeed being processed correctly. This could lead to incorrect behavior if the tallest stack is not the leftmost one, as the problem states that the leftmost tallest stack should be chosen first.

4. **Flag Logic**: The `flag` variable is set to `False` if any pair of consecutive numbers differs by 2 or more at any point in the loop. However, this does not account for the stacks being removed and the subsequent potential interactions between remaining stacks.

5. **Final Output Logic**: The output logic uses a list indexing to print results, which is not a typical or clear way to handle output. It could lead to confusion regarding whether 'YES' or 'NO' corresponds to the condition being checked.

Due to these issues, the function does not fully adhere to the requirements laid out in the problem description regarding how the stacks interact and are processed. As a result, the program is incorrect and does not reliably sort the array according to the described algorithm.
