The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its current value. Therefore, no changes occur in the program's state. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
