According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to the length of `nums`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Now, since `i` will become 1, it will be checked against `len(nums) - 1`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` (which will be 1) is still less than `len(nums) - 1`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, so the loop will execute a second time.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`**
