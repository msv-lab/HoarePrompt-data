Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part in the code.***
