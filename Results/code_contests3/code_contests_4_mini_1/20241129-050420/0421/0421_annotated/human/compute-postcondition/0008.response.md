Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, and `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
