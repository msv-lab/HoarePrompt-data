The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the size of the array, and an array of `n` space-separated integers `ai`, where each integer is between 1 and 100. After executing the function body, it processes these integers based on the defined logic. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we will summarize the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and an array of n integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) and processes these integers accordingly.**
