According to the code, the loop can execute while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been less than `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to continue executing. Given that `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, `len(nums)` is at least 2, making `len(nums) - 1` at least 1. Therefore, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is set to False, and we need to ensure that the loop can execute again. For it to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to reflect the next index in the iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, `i` is updated to the next index (which is currently `i + 1`), and for the loop to execute a second time, `len(nums)` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
