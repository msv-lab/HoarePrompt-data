According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, which means it is currently at the second-to-last index of the `nums` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it `len(nums) - 1`, and the loop will check the condition for that index.

Since `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again if `i` becomes `len(nums) - 1`. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`**
