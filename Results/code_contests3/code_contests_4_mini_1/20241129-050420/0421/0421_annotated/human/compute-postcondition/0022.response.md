The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous state from `True`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
