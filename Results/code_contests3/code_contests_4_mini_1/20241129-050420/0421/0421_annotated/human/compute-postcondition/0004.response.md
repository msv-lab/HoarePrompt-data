According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop is defined to iterate from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be greater than `1` (since `len(nums) - 1` should be at least `0`). 

Given that `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, it does not directly influence the execution of the loop, but it is important to note that `flag` being True doesn't affect the loop execution either.

To summarize, for the loop to execute at least once:
- The `nums` map must contain at least 2 integers, which means its length must be greater than 1.
- The initial value of `i` will be `0` for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` is a non-empty map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0.**
