According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and since `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` must be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to reflect that `i` has been increased to 2, and `len(nums)` must be at least 3 (so that `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`).

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2.**
