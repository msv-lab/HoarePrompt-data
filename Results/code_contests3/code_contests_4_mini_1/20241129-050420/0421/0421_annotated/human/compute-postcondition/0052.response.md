The `print` statement is executed with the list `['NO', 'YES']` indexed by the value of `flag`. The variable `flag` is either `False` or `True`. If `flag` is `False`, the index will be `0`, and the output will be `'NO'`. If `flag` is `True`, the index will be `1`, and the output will be `'YES'`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer; `flag` is either False or True; `nums` is empty after all maximum integers have been removed; Output is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.**
