The value of `flag` is assigned to False, but `flag` was already False before the execution, so there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables are not affected as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
