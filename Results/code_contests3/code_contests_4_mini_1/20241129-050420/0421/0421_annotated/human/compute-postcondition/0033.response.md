To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we note the following:

1. The loop iterates through the indices of the `nums` list, checking the absolute difference between adjacent elements.
2. If the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This means that if the loop completes without breaking, `flag` will remain `True`.
3. The loop will continue to execute until either it has checked all pairs of adjacent elements or it encounters a pair where the absolute difference is greater than or equal to 2.

Given the provided output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times:

- If `flag` is set to `False` during any of these iterations, it indicates that the loop encountered a pair of adjacent elements with a sufficient difference, and thus `flag` remains `False` after all iterations.
- If the loop completes without changing `flag`, it will remain `True`.

Final state considerations:

- If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` will reach `len(nums) - 2` during the last iteration. Therefore, the final value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 2` if the loop executed fully.
- If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute, and `flag` will remain as it was before the loop started.

Considering these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is `False` if there exists at least one adjacent pair in `nums` with an absolute difference of at least 2; otherwise, `flag` is `True`. `nums` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, and `i` is `len(nums) - 2` if the loop executed fully.**
