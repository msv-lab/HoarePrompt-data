According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been updated to the next index, which means `i` is now equal to `len(nums) - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, making it `len(nums) - 1`, and there must still be at least 2 elements in `nums` to compare.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, `flag` is False, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `nums` must have at least 2 elements.**
