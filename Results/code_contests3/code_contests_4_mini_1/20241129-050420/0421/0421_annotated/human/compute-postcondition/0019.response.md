According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False if there exists at least one pair of consecutive integers in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, which means we need to adjust `flag` to True for the loop to execute again. There is no need to adjust `nums` since it is already a non-empty map object.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer, for the loop to execute again `flag` needs to be True, and `nums` is non-empty**
