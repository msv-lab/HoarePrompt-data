According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True, which is fine, but `nums` needs to be a non-empty iterable for the loop to execute. Since `nums` is a map object containing integers from the input string, it will be empty if the input string does not represent any integers. 

To ensure that the loop executes for the first time, `n` (the input string) needs to represent at least one integer, which means it should not be an empty string. Therefore, the conditions to adjust are that `n` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`n` is a non-empty string representing an integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a non-empty map object containing integers from the input string.**
