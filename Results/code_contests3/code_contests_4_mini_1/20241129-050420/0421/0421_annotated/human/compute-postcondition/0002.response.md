The code `nums = map(int, raw_input().split())` processes the input string representing an integer `n`. The `raw_input()` function accepts input from the user, and `split()` breaks the input string into separate components (by whitespace). The `map(int, ...)` function converts each of these components into integers. 

Since `n` is an input string representing an integer, the output state will depend on the actual input provided by the user. However, since `nums` is assigned to the result of this mapping, it will hold a sequence of integers derived from `n`.

The values of `n` and `flag` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows: `n` is an input string representing an integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a map object containing integers from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is a map object containing integers from the input string.**
