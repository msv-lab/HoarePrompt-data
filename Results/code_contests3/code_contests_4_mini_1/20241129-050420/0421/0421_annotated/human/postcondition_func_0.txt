The function accepts an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. It checks for the presence of at least one pair of consecutive integers in the array with an absolute difference of 2 or more. If such a pair exists, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function modifies the array by repeatedly removing the maximum integer until the array is empty, potentially leading to situations where the check for consecutive integers is not fully comprehensive or accurate, especially if the input array contains multiple elements with the same value.
