Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the difference is less than 2, no changes occur within the program.***
