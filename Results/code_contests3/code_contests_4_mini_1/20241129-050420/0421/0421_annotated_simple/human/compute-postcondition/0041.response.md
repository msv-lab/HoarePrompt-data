According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1 for the next iteration. We need to ensure that the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is checked, specifically `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` (if `len(nums)` is greater than 2). 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than or equal to 2.**
