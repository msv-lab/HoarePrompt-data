The code uses a `print` statement to output either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`. Since `flag` is True if all consecutive elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2, the output will be 'YES' if `flag` is True and 'NO' if `flag` is False. The initial state mentions that `nums` is empty after removing all maximum values, but this does not affect the output because the value of `flag` is already determined.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `flag` is True if all consecutive elements in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2; otherwise, `flag` is False; `nums` is empty after all maximum values have been removed; the output is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`.**
