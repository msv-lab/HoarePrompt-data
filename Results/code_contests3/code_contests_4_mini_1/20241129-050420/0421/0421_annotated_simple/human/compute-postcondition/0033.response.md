To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we consider the following points:

1. The loop iterates through the indices of the `nums` list, comparing each element with the next.
2. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive numbers is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to `False` and the loop breaks.
3. If the loop completes without breaking, it indicates that all consecutive pairs in `nums` had an absolute difference of less than 2.

Given that the initial state specifies that `nums` must contain at least 1 integer for the loop to execute, the following scenarios arise:

- If `nums` contains only 1 integer, the loop will not execute, leaving `flag` as `True`.
- If `nums` contains 2 or more integers, the outcome of `flag` will depend on the values within `nums`.

Based on the output states provided after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we conclude that by the end of all iterations:

- If any pair of consecutive integers in `nums` had an absolute difference of 2 or more, `flag` will be `False`.
- If no such pairs exist, `flag` remains `True`.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False depending on the absolute differences in `nums`, and `nums` contains at least 1 integer.**
