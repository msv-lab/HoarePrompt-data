Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program.***
