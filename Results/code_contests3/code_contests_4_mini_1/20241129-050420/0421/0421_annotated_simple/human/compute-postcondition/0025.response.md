According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop iterates while `i` ranges from 0 to `len(nums) - 2` (as `xrange(len(nums) - 1)` goes up to `len(nums) - 2`). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that the loop has executed once for each index from 0 up to `len(nums) - 2`. 

Since `nums` contains at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. After each iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. 

Thus, if `i` is currently at its maximum valid index (which is `len(nums) - 2`), then the next value of `i` will be `len(nums) - 1`, and the loop will need at least one more element in `nums` to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, for the loop to execute one more time `nums` must contain at least 3 integers, and `i` is `len(nums) - 1`**.
