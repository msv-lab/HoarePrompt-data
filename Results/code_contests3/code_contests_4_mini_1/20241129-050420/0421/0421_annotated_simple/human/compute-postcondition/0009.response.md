According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that the loop has checked the pair of integers at indices `i` and `i + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `nums` contains at least 2 integers, it is guaranteed that `len(nums)` is at least 2, meaning `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, allowing for at least one more iteration as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Thus, if `i` is currently less than `len(nums) - 1`, it can be incremented to allow for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` for the next iteration, and the condition for breaking out of the loop depends on the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`.**
