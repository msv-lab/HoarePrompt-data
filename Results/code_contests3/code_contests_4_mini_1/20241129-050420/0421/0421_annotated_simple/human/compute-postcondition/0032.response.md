Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, and `i` is `len(nums)` but must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no action is taken since there is no else part.***
