According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute if both `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty (i.e., it contains elements). 

Right before the loop, `flag` is `True`, which means that condition is satisfied. However, since `nums` is an iterator of integers from input, for the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums` has at least one integer available.

State: **`n` is an input integer; `flag` is True; for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must contain at least one integer**
