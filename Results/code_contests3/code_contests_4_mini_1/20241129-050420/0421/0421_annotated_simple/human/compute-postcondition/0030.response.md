The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, but since it was already `False`, there is no change to its value. The values of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, and `i` is `len(nums)` but must be less than `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, and `i` is `len(nums)` but must be less than `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to execute again.**
