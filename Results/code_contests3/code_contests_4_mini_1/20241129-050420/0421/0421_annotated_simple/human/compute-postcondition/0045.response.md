According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `len(nums)` is at least 2 (since `nums` contains at least 2 elements). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

At this point, since the loop will check the condition again, `i` should be 2, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`**
