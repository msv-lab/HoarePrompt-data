The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1; `flag` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop.
