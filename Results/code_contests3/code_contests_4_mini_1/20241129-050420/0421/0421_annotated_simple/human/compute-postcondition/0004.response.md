According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop will execute if the length of `nums` is greater than 1, as `len(nums) - 1` must be at least 1 for the range to include any values. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 0 for the first execution of the loop. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes at least once, `nums` must contain at least 2 integers. The value of `n` and the state of `flag` do not directly affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must contain at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0**
