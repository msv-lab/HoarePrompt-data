The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its current value. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state is: `n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
