According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is either True or False depending on the absolute differences in `nums`, and `nums` no longer contains the maximum value. For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be True, and `nums` must contain at least one element.

Since we need to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state such that `flag` is True and `nums` contains elements. The condition on `n` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute again, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is True, `nums` contains at least one element**
