According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be the index of the last element that was processed. Since `nums` contains at least 2 integers, the minimum value of `len(nums)` is 2, meaning `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1, allowing `i` to be 0 or 1 during the loop.

If `i` was 0 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` will increment to 1 for the next iteration. If `i` was 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` would need to be less than 1, which it is not.

Thus, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to 1, and `nums` must still contain at least 2 integers, ensuring it can continue iterating.

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
