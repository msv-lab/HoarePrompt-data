Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and `n` space-separated integers `ai` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the elements of an array. It checks if all consecutive elements in the array have an absolute difference of less than 2. If any such difference is found, the function sets a flag to False; otherwise, the flag remains True. After iterating through the array and removing the maximum value repeatedly until the array is empty, it prints 'YES' if the flag is still True (indicating all consecutive elements had an absolute difference of less than 2) or 'NO' if the flag is False at any point. Note that the function does not return any values but prints the result directly.**
