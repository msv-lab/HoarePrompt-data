The `remove` method is called on the list `nums`, which removes the maximum value from the list. The value of `max(nums)` is determined by the current contents of `nums`, but the specific value is not provided in the initial state. The variable `n` is not affected, and `flag` remains unchanged as it depends on the absolute differences of consecutive elements in `nums`. Therefore, the number of elements in `nums` is decreased by one.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is either True or False depending on the absolute differences of consecutive elements in `nums`, `nums` contains one less integer (the maximum has been removed).**
