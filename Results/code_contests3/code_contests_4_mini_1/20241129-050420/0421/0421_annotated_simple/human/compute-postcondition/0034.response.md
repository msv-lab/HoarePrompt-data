The `remove` method is called on the list `nums`, which removes the maximum value from it. The state of `n` is not affected, and `flag` remains either True or False based on the absolute differences in `nums`. After the execution, `nums` will contain the integers excluding the maximum value. The previous values of `nums` are not specified, so we cannot determine the exact resulting list after the maximum has been removed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer; `flag` is either True or False depending on the absolute differences in `nums`; `nums` no longer contains the maximum value.**
