The variable `nums` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which processes an input string from `raw_input()`, splits it into individual components, converts each component into an integer, and returns an iterator of these integers. The previous values of `n` and `flag` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is an iterator of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `flag` is True; `nums` is an iterator of integers from input.**
