The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, but it was already `False`. Therefore, there is no change in the state of the variables. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, for the loop to execute one more time `nums` must contain at least 3 integers, and `i` is `len(nums) - 1**
