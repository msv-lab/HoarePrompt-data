Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, and `nums` contains at least 2 integers. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False and the most internal loop is exited. If the condition is not met, the state of the program remains unchanged since there is no else part.***
