The value of `flag` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `flag` was `True`, but it is now changed to `False`. The values of `n`, `nums`, and `i` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least 2 integers, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
