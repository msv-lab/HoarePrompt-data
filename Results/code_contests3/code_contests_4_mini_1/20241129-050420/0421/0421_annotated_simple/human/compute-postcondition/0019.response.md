According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` can either be True or False based on the absolute differences of consecutive elements in `nums`, and `nums` currently contains one less integer than before. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `flag` must remain True, and `nums` needs to have at least one integer left in it. Since `nums` currently has one less integer, for the loop to execute again, it must contain at least 1 integer.

State: **`n` is an integer, `flag` is True, and for the loop to execute again, `nums` must contain at least 1 integer**
