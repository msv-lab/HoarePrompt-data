According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and the length of `nums` is greater than 2, meaning that `len(nums) - 1` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string and `flag` is False, the length of `nums` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
