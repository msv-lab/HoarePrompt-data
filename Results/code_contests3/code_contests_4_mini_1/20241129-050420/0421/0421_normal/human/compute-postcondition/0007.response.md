The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
