According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

This means that after the current iteration, `i` will become 2. The loop can continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, which implies that `len(nums)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 3**
