To determine what needs to be adjusted in the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we analyze the conditions of the loop: `flag and nums`. 

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - `flag`: This is either `True` or `False`, depending on the contents of `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `flag` must be `True`.
   - `nums`: This is not empty, which means it has elements in it. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must remain non-empty.

2. **Current State**:
   - `n` is a non-empty input string (this does not affect the loop directly).
   - `flag` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `nums` is not empty and has one fewer element after removing the maximum value. This implies that `nums` contained at least one element before the removal of the maximum.
   - `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2` if the loop completes normally or is less than `len(nums) - 2` if the loop breaks early.

3. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - If `flag` is currently `False`, it needs to be adjusted to `True` for the loop to execute again.
   - `nums` must remain non-empty. Since `nums` has one fewer element than it had before, it must have at least one element left. Therefore, the original length of `nums` must have been at least 2.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - If `flag` is `False`, it needs to be adjusted to `True`.
   - No adjustment is needed for `nums`, as long as it remains non-empty and has at least one element left after the maximum value is removed.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is either True or False depending on the contents of `nums`, `nums` is not empty and has one fewer element after removing the maximum value, and if `flag` is currently False, it needs to be True for the loop to execute again**.
