According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `nums` is not empty, `len(nums)` is at least 1, which means `len(nums) - 1` is 0 or greater. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`, meaning that `len(nums)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 1**
