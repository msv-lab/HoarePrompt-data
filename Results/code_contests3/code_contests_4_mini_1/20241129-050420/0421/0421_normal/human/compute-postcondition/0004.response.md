According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1. 

Given that `n` is a non-empty input string, it is reasonable to assume that `nums` is created by splitting this string into at least two elements to satisfy the condition for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `len(nums)` must be at least 2, which means `nums` should contain at least 2 integers. Also, `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must be a map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 0.**
