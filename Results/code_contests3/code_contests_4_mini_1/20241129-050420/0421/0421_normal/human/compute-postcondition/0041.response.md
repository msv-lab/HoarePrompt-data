According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop is designed to iterate from `i = 0` to `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since the length of `nums` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`. After the last iteration, the variable `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Thus, `i` will be 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 2`, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, the length of `nums` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, causing a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
