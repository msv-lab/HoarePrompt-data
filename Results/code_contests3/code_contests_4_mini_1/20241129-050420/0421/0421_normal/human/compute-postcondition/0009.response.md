According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**
