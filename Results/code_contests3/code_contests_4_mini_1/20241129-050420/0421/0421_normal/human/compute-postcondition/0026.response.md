The value of `flag` is explicitly set to False, but since it was already False, there is no change in its value. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 1**
