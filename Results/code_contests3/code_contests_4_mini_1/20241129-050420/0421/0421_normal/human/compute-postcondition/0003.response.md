According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as both conditions are true: `flag` must be `True` and `nums` must not be empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is set to `True`, which is fine. However, `nums` is a map object created from the input string `n`, which implies it may not be empty if the input string `n` contains elements. 

To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the input string `n` is not empty, so that `nums` contains elements. 

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string representing the size of the array; `flag` is True; `nums` is a map object of integers from the non-empty input string split into individual elements.**
