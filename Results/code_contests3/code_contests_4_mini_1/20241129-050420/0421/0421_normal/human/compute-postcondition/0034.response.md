Output State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is either True or False depending on the contents of `nums`, `nums` is not empty and now has one fewer element after removing the maximum value, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 2` if the loop completes normally without breaking, or `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2` if the loop breaks early.**
