The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `n`, `nums`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.**
