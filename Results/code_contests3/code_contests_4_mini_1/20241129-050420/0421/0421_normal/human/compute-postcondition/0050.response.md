The `nums.remove(max(nums))` statement removes the maximum value from the list `nums`. The previous state of `nums` is not specified, but we know its length is greater than 1, and `flag` is determined by the absolute differences between adjacent elements in `nums`. 

After executing the code, `nums` will have one fewer element, specifically the maximum value will be removed. The variable `flag` is not affected by this operation, but its value depends on the remaining elements in `nums` after the maximum value has been removed, which could potentially change the condition that sets `flag`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is either True or False depending on the new adjacent differences in `nums`, and `nums` has one less element than before.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is either True or False depending on the new adjacent differences in `nums`, `nums` has one less element than before.**
