According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `nums`, and the condition for `flag`. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must not be empty, which means its length must be greater than 0. Additionally, `flag` must be set to True to allow the loop to execute. 

Since `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, we can infer that:
- `i` should be 0 for the loop to execute the first time, as it is calculated from `xrange(len(nums) - 1)`.

Thus, the required states for the loop to execute again are:
- `flag` is True,
- `nums` is a non-empty list (to ensure the length is greater than 0),
- `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is True, `nums` is not empty, `i` is 0**
