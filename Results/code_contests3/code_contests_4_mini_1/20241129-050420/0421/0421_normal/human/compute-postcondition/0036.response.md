According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is not empty and has one fewer element after removing the maximum value, we can infer that `len(nums)` is at least 1. Therefore, `len(nums) - 1` will be at least 0. However, for the loop to execute, `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than 0, meaning `len(nums)` must be greater than 1.

Additionally, the loop uses the variable `i`, which will start at 0. 

Since `flag` needs to be True for the loop to execute again and is currently False, we need to set `flag` to True.

Thus, for the loop to execute:

- `flag` must be True.
- `len(nums)` must be greater than 1 (which implies that `nums` must have at least 2 elements).
- `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is True, `len(nums)` is greater than 1, `i` is 0**
