Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes, as there is no else part.***
