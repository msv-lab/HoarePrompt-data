The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, but it was already `False` in the initial state, so the value remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty input string, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object containing at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
