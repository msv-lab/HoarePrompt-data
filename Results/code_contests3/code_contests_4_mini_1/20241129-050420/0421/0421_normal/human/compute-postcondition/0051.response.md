Output State: **`n` is a non-empty input string; `flag` is False if any adjacent integers in `nums` had an absolute difference of 2 or more during any iteration; otherwise, `flag` is True; `nums` is empty if the loop executed completely until all elements were removed, or it contains integers that all had adjacent differences of less than 2 before the maximum was repeatedly removed. In the end, `i` is not relevant as the loop has finished executing.**
