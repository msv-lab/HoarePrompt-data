The function `func` does not have any parameters explicitly mentioned in the definition, but it accepts input in the form of an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers that represent the elements of an array. The integer `n` must be between 1 and 10, and each element `ai` of the array must be between 1 and 100. The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the provided information. Therefore, we can only describe the accepted input.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the array, followed by n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) as elements of the array. The output is not specified.**
