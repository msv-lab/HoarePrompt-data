To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the loop. The loop condition is `flag and nums`, meaning the loop will continue executing as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is non-empty.

1. **Analyzing `flag`**: 
   - The state indicates that `flag` is False if any adjacent integers in `nums` have an absolute difference of 2 or more. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `flag` must be set to True. This means there should be no adjacent integers in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more.

2. **Analyzing `nums`**: 
   - The state indicates that `nums` is a map object containing integers from the input string, and it has the maximum element removed. If `nums` is non-empty, it means there are still integers left in the collection. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must remain non-empty.

Given these considerations, we need to adjust the state so that `flag` is True and `nums` is still non-empty.

State: **`n` is a non-empty input string; for the loop to execute again, `flag` must be True and `nums` must not be empty**.
