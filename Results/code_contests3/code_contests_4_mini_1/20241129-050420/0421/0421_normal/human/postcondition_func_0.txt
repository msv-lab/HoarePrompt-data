The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) that indicates the number of elements in an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). It checks if all adjacent integers in the array have an absolute difference of less than 2. If any adjacent integers do have a difference of 2 or more, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function modifies the list by repeatedly removing the maximum element until all elements are processed or the condition is violated.
