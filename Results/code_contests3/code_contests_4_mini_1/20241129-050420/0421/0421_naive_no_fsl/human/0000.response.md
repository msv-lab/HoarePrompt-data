Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the described algorithm for sorting using the ravioli stacks. Specifically, the logic for checking whether the algorithm can sort the array is flawed. 

### Issue:
1. The program uses a while loop that checks if the flag is still true and there are remaining numbers in `nums`. However, it only checks adjacent stacks once, and if any pair of adjacent numbers has a height difference of 2 or more, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This does not account for the fact that the algorithm needs to observe the entire array at each step of removing the tallest stack.

2. The removal of the maximum element from `nums` and the subsequent output logic (`print['NO', 'YES'][flag]`) is misleading and does not correctly represent whether the array can be sorted. The removal of the maximum number should be done after checking all stacks, not immediately.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 1 2
```
In this scenario:
- The tallest stack is 3, and the next adjacent stack is 1.
- According to the algorithm, ravioli from the stack of height 3 will slide down onto the stack of height 1, creating a new stack of height 4.
- The expected output would be "NO", but the program incorrectly returns "YES".

Thus, since the program does not correctly implement the described sorting algorithm and fails in certain cases, the correctness is marked as **False**.
