The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All four parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities. The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the integer coordinates of two distinct cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are integers representing the coordinates of two distinct cities, and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities.**
