The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two distinct cities (x1, y1, x2, y2) and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities. There are no checks for the validity of the input coordinates, but it is assumed that the coordinates are within the specified bounds. The function directly calculates the distance using the standard Euclidean distance formula.
