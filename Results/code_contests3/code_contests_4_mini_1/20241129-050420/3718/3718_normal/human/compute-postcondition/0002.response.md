Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of two different cities. It computes and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities, which is always a non-negative value since it is derived from the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in their coordinates. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in this implementation as it directly computes the distance based on the provided coordinates. **
