The function `func_1` accepts parameters `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities and return the Euclidean distance between these two cities.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities, and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities.**
