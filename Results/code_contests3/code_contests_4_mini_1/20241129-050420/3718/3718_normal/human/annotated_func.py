#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities, and the distances from these cities to the flatlanders are non-negative integers such that |x1|, |y1|, |x2|, |y2| ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ r1, r2 ≤ 10^4.
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of two different cities. It computes and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities, which is always a non-negative value since it is derived from the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in their coordinates. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in this implementation as it directly computes the distance based on the provided coordinates.
