The function accepts four integer parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) that represent the coordinates of two cities and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities. The function does not handle any potential issues such as the input being non-integer values or the square root of negative numbers, but it effectively computes the distance using the formula for Euclidean distance in a two-dimensional space.
