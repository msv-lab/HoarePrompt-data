The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. Each of these parameters is an integer representing the coordinates of two different cities. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities represented by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the integer coordinates of two cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 representing the coordinates of two cities, and returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities.**
