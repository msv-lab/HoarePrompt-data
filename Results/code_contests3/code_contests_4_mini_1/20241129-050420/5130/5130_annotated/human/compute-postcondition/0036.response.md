According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Thus, `i` will be 2 after the increment. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, we can conclude that for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
