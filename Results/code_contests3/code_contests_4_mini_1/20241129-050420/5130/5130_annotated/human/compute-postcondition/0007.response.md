The value of `col` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `col` is unknown, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `comps` is equal to 0, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, the element at index `i` of `comps` is equal to 0, and `col` is increased by 1.**
