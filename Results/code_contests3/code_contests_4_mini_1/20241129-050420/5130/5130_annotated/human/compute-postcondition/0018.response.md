The statement `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to `comps[j]`. The variable `comps[j]` will be updated with this new value, while the other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The previous value of `comps[j]` is not specified but it will now hold the value of `col`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is equal to `col`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is equal to `col`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.**
