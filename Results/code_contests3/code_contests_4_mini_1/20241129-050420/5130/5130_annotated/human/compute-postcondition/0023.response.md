`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, which has been increased by 1. The value of `i` is 1, so `comps[1]` is now set to the new value of `col`. The specific value of `col` is not provided, but it is known to be greater than its previous value. The other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the new value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the new value of `col**.
