To analyze the given code snippet, we note the following:

1. The variable `col` has been increased by 1.
2. The variable `comps[1]` is now equal to the new value of `col`.
3. The variable `j` is now equal to `p[1]`.

The code `comps[j] = col` assigns the current value of `col` to the array `comps` at the index `j`. 

As we don't have specific values for `p[1]`, `comps`, or the new value of `col`, we can summarize the impact of the operation. The value of `comps[j]` will be set to the new value of `col`, but without knowing `j` or the previous contents of `comps`, we can't specify exact values.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes and the assignment made:

Output State: **`col` is increased by 1; `comps[j]` is now equal to the new value of `col`, where `j` is equal to `p[1]`.**
