`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col` after it has been increased by 1. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col` after it has been increased by 1.**
