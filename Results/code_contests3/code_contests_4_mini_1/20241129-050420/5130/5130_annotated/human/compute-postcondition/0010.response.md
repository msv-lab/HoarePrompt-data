According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `comps[p[j]]`. The loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Right before the loop, `comps[i]` is equal to `col`, which does not guarantee that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0, since `p[j]` is not defined in relation to `i`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` is indeed equal to 0 for the loop to execute the first time. 

To enable the first iteration of the loop, we must ensure that `p[j]` indexes into `comps` such that `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Since `j` is 0, `p[j]` should be a valid index that maps to a position in `comps` where its value equals 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time then `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0**
