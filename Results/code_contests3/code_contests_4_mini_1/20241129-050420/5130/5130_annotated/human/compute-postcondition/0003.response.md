The list `comps` is assigned a new list created by a list comprehension that initializes `n` elements to 0. The previous values of the other variables `p` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `comps` and maintains the values of `n`, `p`, and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is assigned a list of integers based on the input permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is assigned a list of integers from the input; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.**
