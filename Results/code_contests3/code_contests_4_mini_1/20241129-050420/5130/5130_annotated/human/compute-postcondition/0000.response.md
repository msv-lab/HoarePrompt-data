The code snippet assigns a new value to `n` based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which is then converted to an integer. The previous state of `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 200,000. The variables `p` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation as they are not modified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`, and `n` is updated to an input integer.**
