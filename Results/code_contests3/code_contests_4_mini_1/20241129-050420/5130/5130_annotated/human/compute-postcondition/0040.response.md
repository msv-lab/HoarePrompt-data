According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute, `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0. Right before the loop, we have `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col` after it has been increased by 1. This means `comps[p[j]]` depends on `p[2]`.

Since `comps[2]` is not explicitly stated to be equal to 0, we need to ensure that `comps[p[j]]` (which is `comps[p[2]]`) is equal to 0 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, we need to adjust `comps[p[j]]` such that it equals 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `comps[p[j]]` is 0.**
