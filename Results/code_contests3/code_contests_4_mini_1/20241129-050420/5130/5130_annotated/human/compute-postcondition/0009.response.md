`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is 0.**
