Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `comps[i]` is set to `col`, and all `comps` values for the indices traversed by `p` starting from the last assigned value of `j` are equal to `col`.***
