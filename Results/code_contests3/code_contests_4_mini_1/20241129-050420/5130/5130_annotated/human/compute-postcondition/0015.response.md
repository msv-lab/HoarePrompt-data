The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `comps[j]` was previously equal to `col`, now `comps[j]` is still equal to `col`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is equal to `col`; `comps[j]` is equal to `col`; `j` is updated to `p[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is equal to `col`; `comps[j]` is equal to `col`; `j` is updated to `p[j]`**.
