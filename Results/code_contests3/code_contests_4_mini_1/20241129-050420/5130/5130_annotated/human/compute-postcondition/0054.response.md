Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, a list `p` that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It calculates the number of distinct connected components in the permutation `p`, returning 0 if there is only one connected component, or the count of components otherwise. Additionally, if the sum of the elements in `b` is zero, it returns an additional 1 to the final result. Therefore, it effectively returns the number of connected components in the permutation minus 1 if there is at least one element in `b` that is 1. **
