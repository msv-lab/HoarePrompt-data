According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `comps[p[j]]` is 0, which means the loop can execute once more. Since `comps[p[j]]` is already 0, it does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, no other states need to be changed for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
