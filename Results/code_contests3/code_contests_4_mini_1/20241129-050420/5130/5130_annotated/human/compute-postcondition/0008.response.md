`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` is increased by 1 prior to this assignment, `comps[i]` will now hold the value of the incremented `col`. The previous value at index `i` of `comps` was 0, but it will now change as a result of this assignment. The other variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col` (which has been increased by 1).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`.**
