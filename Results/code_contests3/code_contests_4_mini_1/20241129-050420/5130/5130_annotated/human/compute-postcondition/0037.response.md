The variable `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is unknown, and while `n` is constrained to be an integer between 1 and 200,000, it does not affect the increment operation on `col`. The other variable `i` is also not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1**
