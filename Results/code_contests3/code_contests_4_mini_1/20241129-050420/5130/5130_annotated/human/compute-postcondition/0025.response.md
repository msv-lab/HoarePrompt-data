According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute for the first time, `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0. 

Right before the loop, we have `j` equal to 1. This means we need to ensure that the index `p[1]` is valid and that `comps[p[1]]` is currently equal to 0. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, we need to ensure that `p[j]`, which is `p[1]`, is within the bounds of `comps`. 

If `p[1]` is within the valid range and `comps[p[1]]` is indeed 0, then the loop can execute. If not, we need to adjust the state.

We need to ensure that:
1. `p[1]` is a valid index for the `comps` array.
2. `comps[p[1]]` is equal to 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, we can state the following:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[1]` is now equal to the new value of `col`; `j` is 1; for the loop to execute the first time, `p[1]` must be a valid index and `comps[p[1]]` must be equal to 0**.
