`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` is increased by 1 prior to this assignment, but its specific value is unknown. The value of `i` is 2, which means `comps[2]` will be set to the increased value of `col`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col` after it has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col` after it has been increased by 1.**
