Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `comps[j]` is equal to `col` for all indices `j` that were reached during the loop, `comps[p[j]]` is 0 for the last `j` used, and `j` is the last index reached. Additionally, `col` is equal to the initial value of `col` plus the number of iterations executed.***
