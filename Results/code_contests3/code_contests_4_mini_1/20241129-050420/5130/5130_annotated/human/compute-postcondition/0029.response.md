The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since `comps[j]` must be equal to 0 for the loop to execute again, we assume the value of `j` is now updated to the new index provided by `p`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `col` is increased by 1; `comps[j]` is now equal to the new value of `col`; `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.

Output State: **`col` is increased by 1; `comps[j]` is now equal to the new value of `col`; `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
