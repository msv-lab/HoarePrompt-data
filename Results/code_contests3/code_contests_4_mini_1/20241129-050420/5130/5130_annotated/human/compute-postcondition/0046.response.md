According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `comps[p[j]] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `p[2]`, and `comps[p[j]]` is currently `col`. For the loop to execute one more time, it is essential that `comps[p[j]]` remains equal to 0. Therefore, `col` must be equal to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0**.
