The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The value of `j` is initially 2, so `j` now takes the value of `p[2]`. The specific value of `p[2]` is not known from the initial state, but it will change the value of `j`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `comps[p[j]]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, `comps[p[j]]` is 0**
