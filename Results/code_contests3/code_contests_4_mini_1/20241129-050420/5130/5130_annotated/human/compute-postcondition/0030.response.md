The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` has been increased by 1, `comps[j]` will now hold this new value of `col`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the new assignment. 

Output State: **`col` is increased by 1; `comps[j]` is equal to the new value of `col`; `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0; `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
