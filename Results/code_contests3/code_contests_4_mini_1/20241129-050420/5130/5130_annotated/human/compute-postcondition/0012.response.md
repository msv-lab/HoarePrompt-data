The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `j` is unknown, and therefore `comps[j]` will be updated to reflect the value of `col`. The initial states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 0; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `comps[j]` is equal to `col` where `j` is assigned a new but unknown value.**
