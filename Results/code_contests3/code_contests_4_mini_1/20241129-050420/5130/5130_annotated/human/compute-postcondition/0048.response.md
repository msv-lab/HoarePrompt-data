The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` at this point is `p[2]`, and the value of `col` is not provided in the initial state. However, since `comps[j]` is updated, the relevant state is affected, and the other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `j` is now `p[2]`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `j` is now `p[2]`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
