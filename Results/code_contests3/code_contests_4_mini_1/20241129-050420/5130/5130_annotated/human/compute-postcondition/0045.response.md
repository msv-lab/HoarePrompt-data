`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `j` is now `p[2]`, the output state will reflect the assignment to `comps[p[2]]`. The value of `comps[p[j]]` is initially 0, but now it will be updated to `col`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, `comps[p[j]]` is now `col`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[2]`, `comps[p[j]]` is now `col`**.
