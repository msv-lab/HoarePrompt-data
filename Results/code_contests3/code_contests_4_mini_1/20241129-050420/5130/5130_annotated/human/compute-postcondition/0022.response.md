The value of `col` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `col` is unknown, but it is assumed that it exists and that `col` is a variable that can hold integer values. The states of the other variables, `n` and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1**
