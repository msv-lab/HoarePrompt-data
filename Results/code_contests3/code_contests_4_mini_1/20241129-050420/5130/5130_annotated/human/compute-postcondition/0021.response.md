According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` is currently 0, it will be increased to 1 for the next iteration. The loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
