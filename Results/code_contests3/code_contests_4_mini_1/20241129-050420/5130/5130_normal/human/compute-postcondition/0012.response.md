`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is currently 0. The value of `j` is assigned from `p[0]`, and since `comps[p[0]]` is also 0, the assignment will result in `comps[j]` being set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[p[0]]` is 0, `col` is 0 before incrementing, and `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, so `comps[j]` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `comps[p[0]]` is 0, `col` is 0 before incrementing, `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `comps[j]` is now 0.**
