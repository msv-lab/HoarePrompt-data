The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute, `comps[p[1]]` must be equal to 0, which indicates that `p[1]` is a valid index. The value of `j` will now be updated based on the value stored in `p[1]`. However, without knowing the specific values of `p`, we cannot determine the new value of `j`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is now assigned the value of `p[1]`, and for the loop to execute, `comps[p[1]]` must be equal to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is now assigned the value of `p[1]`, and for the loop to execute, `comps[p[1]]` must be equal to 0.**
