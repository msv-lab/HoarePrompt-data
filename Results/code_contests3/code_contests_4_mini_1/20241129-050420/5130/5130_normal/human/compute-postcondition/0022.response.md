The variable `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown, and other variables (`n`, `i`, `comps[1]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `comps[1]` must be equal to 0, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `comps[1]` must be equal to 0, and `col` is increased by 1**
