The code initializes a list `comps` with `n` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000, the length of the list `comps` will be equal to `n`. The previous values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where each element is decremented by 1; `b` is now assigned a list of integers from the input, converted to integers; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000; `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where each element is decremented by 1; `b` is now assigned a list of integers from the input, converted to integers; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.**
