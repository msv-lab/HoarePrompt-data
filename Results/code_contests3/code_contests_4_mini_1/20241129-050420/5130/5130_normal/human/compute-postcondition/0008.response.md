`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, which is increased by 1. Since `i` is initially 0, `comps[0]` will be set to the value of `col`. The values of the other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1.**
