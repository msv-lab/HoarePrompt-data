The value of `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer input from 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `j` is 0**
