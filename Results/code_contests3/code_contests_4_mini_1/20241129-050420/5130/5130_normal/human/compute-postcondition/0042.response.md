In the given code, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is updated to `p[2]`, and `comps[p[2]]` must equal 0 for the loop to execute the first time. Therefore, `comps[j]` will now hold the value of `col`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col`, `j` is updated to `p[2]`, and `comps[j]` is set to `col`.**
