`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and since `i` is 2, `comps[2]` will be set to the current value of `col`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col`**
