Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list `p` representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` of zeros and ones. It identifies the number of unique components in the permutation and checks if all elements in `b` are zeros. The function returns the number of unique components minus one if there is more than one component, or zero if there is only one component, and adds one if all elements in `b` are zeros. **
