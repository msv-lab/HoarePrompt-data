The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, `j` will also be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col`, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is set to the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
