According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again provided that `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**.
