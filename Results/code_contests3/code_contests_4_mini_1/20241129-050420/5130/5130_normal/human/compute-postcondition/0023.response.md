`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `i` is 1 and `col` is increased by 1 (though the specific value of `col` is not provided), we can denote the new value of `col` as its previous value plus 1. The previous value of `comps[1]` is 0, so now `comps[1]` will hold the new value of `col`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `comps[1]` is now equal to the new value of `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `comps[1]` is now equal to the new value of `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.**
