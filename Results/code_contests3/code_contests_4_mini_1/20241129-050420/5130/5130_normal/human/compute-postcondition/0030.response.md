The statement `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to the index `j` of the list (or array) `comps`. The variable `j` has previously been assigned the value of `p[j]`, but we do not know what `p[j]` is, so the specific value of `j` remains unknown. The values of `n`, `i`, and `col` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col.**
