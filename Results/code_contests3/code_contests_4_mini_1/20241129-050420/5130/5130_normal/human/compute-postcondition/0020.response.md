Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `col` is the final incremented value after the loop finishes, `j` is the last value assigned from `p[j]`, and `comps` contains the values assigned to the indices accessed by `p` during the loop execution. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, the loop executes, otherwise, there is no else part.***
