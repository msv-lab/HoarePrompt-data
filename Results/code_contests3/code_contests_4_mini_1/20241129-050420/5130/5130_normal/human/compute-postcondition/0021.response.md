According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `comps` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute again if `comps[i]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `comps` contains values assigned to the indices accessed by `p`. For the loop to execute one more time, `comps[0]` must be 0. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to become 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `comps[1]` must be equal to 0**
