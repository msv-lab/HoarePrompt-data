The function `func` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. The parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length equal to `n`. 

After executing the function body, the output will be determined by specific conditions related to the values in `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p` representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n and a list `b` of zeros and ones. It processes these inputs to produce a result based on the values in `b`.**
