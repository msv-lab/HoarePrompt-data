`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` is increased by 1, its previous value is unknown, but after this assignment, `comps[i]` will hold the new value of `col`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[i]` is now equal to `col.**
