Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `col` is the final incremented value after all iterations, and `j` is the final value determined by following the indices in `p`. If `comps[i]` is 0, the `comps` array is updated such that all indices visited by `j` during the iterations have the value of `col`.***
