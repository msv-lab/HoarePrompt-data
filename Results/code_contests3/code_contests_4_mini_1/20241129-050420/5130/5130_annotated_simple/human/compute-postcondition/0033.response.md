The code `comps[j] = col` assigns the value of `col` to `comps[j]`. The previous state indicates that `comps[j]` was initially 0 (since `comps[p[j]]` must remain equal to 0 for the loop to execute) and `col` was increased by 1. Therefore, now `comps[j]` will hold the value of `col`, which is the incremented value.

The impact on the program is that `comps[j]` is updated to the value of `col`. Other variables (`n`, `i`, `col`, `j`, `comps[i]`, `p[j]`, etc.) are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is now equal to `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is updated to `p[j]`.**
