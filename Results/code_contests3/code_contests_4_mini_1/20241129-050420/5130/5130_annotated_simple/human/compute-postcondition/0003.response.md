The code initializes a list `comps` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The previous state indicates that `n` is within the range of 1 to 200,000. Therefore, `comps` will contain `n` zeros. The variables `p` and `b` remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input values; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros.**
