The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \).
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, where each integer is in the range \([1, n]\).
- `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length `n`.

The function does not have explicit return values stated in the provided output. Therefore, we cannot determine specific return cases without further information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n, a list p representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a list b consisting of zeros and ones, but the specific return value is not provided.**
