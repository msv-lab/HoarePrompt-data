The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is unknown. Other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1**
