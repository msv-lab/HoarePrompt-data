Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is now equal to `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and for the loop to execute again, `comps[p[j]]` must remain equal to 0; `j` is updated to `p[j]`.**
