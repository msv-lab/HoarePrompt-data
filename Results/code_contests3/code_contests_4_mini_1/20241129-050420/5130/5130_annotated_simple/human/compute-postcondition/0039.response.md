`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, after execution, `j` will also be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `comps[2]` is equal to the updated value of `col`; `j` is 2.  
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `comps[2]` is equal to the updated value of `col`; `j` is 2**
