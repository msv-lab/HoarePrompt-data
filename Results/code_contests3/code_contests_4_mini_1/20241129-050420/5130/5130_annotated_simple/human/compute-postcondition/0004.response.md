The variable `col` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the other variables, `n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input values; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros; `col` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`; `b` is a map object containing integers from the input values; `comps` is a list of `n` zeros; `col` is 0.**
