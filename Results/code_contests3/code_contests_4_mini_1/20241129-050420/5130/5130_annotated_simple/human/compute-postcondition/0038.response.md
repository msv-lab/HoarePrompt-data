`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The initial value of `i` is 2, and `col` has been increased by 1. Therefore, the value assigned to `comps[2]` will be the updated value of `col`. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its value is still within the specified range. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `comps[2]` is equal to the updated value of `col`.**
