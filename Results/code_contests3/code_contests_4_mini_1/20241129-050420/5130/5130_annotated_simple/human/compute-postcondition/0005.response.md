According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the for loop, and it will increment with each iteration. 

Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is within the valid range, so the loop can execute. The first iteration of the loop will set `i` to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
