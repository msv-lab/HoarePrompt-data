`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `comps[j]` is not mentioned, but `comps[2]` has an updated value of `col`. The variable `j` has been updated to `p[j]`, but we do not know the specific value of `j` or `p[j]`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the assignment occurs, but without specific values for `j` and `col`.

Output State: **`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`; `comps[2]` is equal to the updated value of `col`, and `j` is updated to `p[j]`.**
