The value of `j` is updated to `p[j]`, but the specific value of `p[j]` is not provided, and the value of `comps[p[j]]` must be 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged, and the output state reflects the update of `j`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 2; `comps[2]` is equal to the updated value of `col`; `j` is updated to `p[j]`.**
