`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The values of the other variables, `n`, `comps[0]`, and `col`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, and `j` is 0**.
