According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `comps[p[j]]` is equal to 0. Right before the loop, we know that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, which means we need to consider the value of `p[j]`. 

Since `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `p[j]` is a valid index and that `comps[p[j]]` is indeed 0. Moreover, since `j` is currently 1, `p[j]` must be defined and within the bounds of the `comps` array. 

However, we don't have any information about the contents of the array `comps` or the array `p`. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, we can assume we need to set `comps[p[j]]` to 0, which means `p[j]` should point to an index in `comps` where the value is currently 0.

Thus, we need to ensure the following conditions for the loop to execute:
- `p[j]` must be a valid index for `comps`
- `comps[p[j]]` must equal 0 at the time of the loop.

Since we do not have any specific values for `p[j]` and `comps`, we cannot state exact values, but we can note that `comps[p[j]]` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[j]]` must be equal to 0**
