The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `col` was previously increased by 1, `comps[j]` now holds the value of that incremented `col`. Other variables in the initial state are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `comps[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is increased by 1; `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`; `j` is now equal to `p[j]`; `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`; `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
