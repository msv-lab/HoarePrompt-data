The variable `p` is assigned a new list, which is created by taking input values, splitting them, converting each value to an integer, and then subtracting 1 from each. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, the input will consist of `n` integers which are a permutation of the range [1, n]. After the execution, `p` will contain integers from `0` to `n-1`, representing the adjusted permutation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` based on the input values.**
