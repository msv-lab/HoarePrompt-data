Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is 1; `col` is the final incremented value after all iterations; `j` is the final value determined by following the indices in `p`; `comps` array is updated such that all indices visited by `j` during the iterations have the value of `col`.**
