The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The other variables `n`, `col`, and `comps` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, after execution, `j` will be 1, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[i]` is now equal to `col`, `j` is 1**
