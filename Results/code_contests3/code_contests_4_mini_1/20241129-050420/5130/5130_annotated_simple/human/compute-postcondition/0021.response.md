According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means that the loop has not yet executed. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged but must still satisfy the condition that it is greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
