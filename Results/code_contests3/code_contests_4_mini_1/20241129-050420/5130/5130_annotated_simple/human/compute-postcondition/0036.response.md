According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Additionally, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
