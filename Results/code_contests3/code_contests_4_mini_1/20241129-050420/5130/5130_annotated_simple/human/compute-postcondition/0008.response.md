`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The initial value of `col` is unknown, but `i` is 0 and `comps[0]` is equal to 0 before the assignment. After execution, the value of `comps[0]` will now be equal to the value of `col`, and the states of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` is increased by 1.**
