Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The purpose of the problem is to find the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, either all doors in the left exit (0s) or all doors in the right exit (1s) are open.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Logic Error in the Loop**: The loop `for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1)` iterates from the second-to-last index to the first index in reverse order. This logic is flawed because it only checks for the last differing element between the two types of exits (0 and 1). It does not account for the actual count of doors that need to be opened to allow exiting through either the left or right exit.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Exit**: The program attempts to find the last index where the door type changes and assigns `ans` to `i + 1`. This does not guarantee that all doors in at least one exit are opened by index `ans`, as it does not track how many doors of each type have been opened.

3. **No Tracking of Opened Doors**: The program does not maintain a count of how many doors have been opened for each exit. It is essential to count the number of 0s and 1s opened until either count reaches its total number.

To illustrate with an example:
- For the input `5` followed by `0 0 1 0 0`, the correct output should be `3`, since after opening the first 3 doors, all doors in the right exit (1) are opened.
- The program's logic does not provide a way to ensure this condition is met, leading to incorrect outputs.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
