The value of `n` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which means that `n` will hold an iterable of integers parsed from the input string that is split into separate components. The initial state indicates that `n` is some integer within the range [2, 200000], and the sequence of doors opened is a list of integers (0s and 1s). The input will replace the existing value of `n`. Other variables are not affected in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a list of integers parsed from input, and the sequence of doors opened is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.**
