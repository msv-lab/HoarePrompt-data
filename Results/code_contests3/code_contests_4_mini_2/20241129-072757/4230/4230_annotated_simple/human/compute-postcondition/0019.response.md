The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and a parameter `doors`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 (representing a left exit) or 1 (representing a right exit). The sequence contains at least one 0 and at least one 1. 

The output of the function is determined by the configuration of the `doors`. 

- Case 1: If the first door is 0, the function returns "left". 
- Case 2: If the first door is 1, the function returns "right". 
- Case 3: If the last door is 0, the function returns "left". 
- Case 4: If the last door is 1, the function returns "right". 

Thus, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `doors`, and return the exit direction based on the configuration of the first and last doors in the sequence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and a list of integers doors. It returns "left" if the first door is 0 or the last door is 0; otherwise, it returns "right".**
