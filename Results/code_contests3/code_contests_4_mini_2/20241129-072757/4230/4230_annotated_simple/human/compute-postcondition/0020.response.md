The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the number of doors, and a sequence of integers `c` that indicate whether each door opens to the left (0) or the right (1). The function then iterates through the list of doors in reverse, looking for the last index where the doors differ. If it finds such an index, it sets `ans` to that index plus one and breaks out of the loop. If all doors are the same, `ans` remains 0. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

However, the annotations incorrectly state that the function will return "left" or "right" based on the values of the first or last door, which does not occur in the actual code. Instead, the function only prints the index of the last differing door plus one or 0 if all doors are the same.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of doors) and a list `c` of integers (0 or 1 indicating left or right exits), and prints the index (plus one) of the last differing door or 0 if all doors are the same. It does not return "left" or "right" as incorrectly stated in the annotations. **
