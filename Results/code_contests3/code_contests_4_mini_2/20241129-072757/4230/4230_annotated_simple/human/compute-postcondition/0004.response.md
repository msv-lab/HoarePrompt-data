According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will iterate from `n - 2` down to `0`, which means that `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is less than `2`, the loop will not run.

Before the loop starts, `ans` is `0`, and `c` is a map object that may not directly affect the loop's execution. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `2`, and we should initialize `i` to `n - 2`, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, for the loop to execute the first time.**
