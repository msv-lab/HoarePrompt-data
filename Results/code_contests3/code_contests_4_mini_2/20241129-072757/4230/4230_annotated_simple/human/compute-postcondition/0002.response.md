The variable `c` is assigned the value of a map object that converts each element of the input list (which is a sequence of integers) into integers. The first integer from the input list is assigned to `n`, but `n` itself is not modified by this line of code. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first integer from the input list, and `c` is a map object of integers from the input list.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input list, `c` is a map object of integers from the input list**
