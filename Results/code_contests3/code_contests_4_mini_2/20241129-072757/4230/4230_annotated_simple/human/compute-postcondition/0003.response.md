The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `c` are not affected by this line of code, as it only assigns a value to `ans`. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `ans` while leaving `n` and `c` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input list, `c` is a map object of integers from the input list, `ans` is 0**
