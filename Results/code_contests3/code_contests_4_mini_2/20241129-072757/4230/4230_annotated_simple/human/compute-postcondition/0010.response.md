`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` must be at least 1 (and will be decremented to 0), the value of `ans` will be 2 (if `i` is 1) or greater (if `i` is more than 1). Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 1, and `ans` is at least 2. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is at least 1, and `ans` is at least 2**
