According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates backward from `n - 2` to `0`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be decremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be at least `0` because the loop will stop executing when `i` becomes less than `0`. Since `n` is at least `2`, the loop can execute once more as long as `i` is at least `0`. 

If `i` is currently `0`, it will be decremented to `-1`, which means the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `1`. 

Thus, if `i` was `1` at the end of the last iteration, it will be decremented to `0` for the next iteration, and `c[i]` would be `c[1]`. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be at least 1 and will be decremented to 0.**
