You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Three years have passes and nothing changed. It is still raining in London, and Mr. Black has to close all the doors in his home in order to not be flooded. Once, however, Mr. Black became so nervous that he opened one door, then another, then one more and so on until he opened all the doors in his house.

There are exactly two exits from Mr. Black's house, let's name them left and right exits. There are several doors in each of the exits, so each door in Mr. Black's house is located either in the left or in the right exit. You know where each door is located. Initially all the doors are closed. Mr. Black can exit the house if and only if all doors in at least one of the exits is open. You are given a sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors, please find the smallest index k such that Mr. Black can exit the house after opening the first k doors.

We have to note that Mr. Black opened each door at most once, and in the end all doors became open.

Input

The first line contains integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of doors.

The next line contains n integers: the sequence in which Mr. Black opened the doors. The i-th of these integers is equal to 0 in case the i-th opened door is located in the left exit, and it is equal to 1 in case it is in the right exit.

It is guaranteed that there is at least one door located in the left exit and there is at least one door located in the right exit.

Output

Print the smallest integer k such that after Mr. Black opened the first k doors, he was able to exit the house.

Examples

Input

Input


4
1 0 0 1


Output


3

Note

In the first example the first two doors are from the left exit, so when Mr. Black opened both of them only, there were two more closed door in the left exit and one closed door in the right exit. So Mr. Black wasn't able to exit at that moment.

When he opened the third door, all doors from the right exit became open, so Mr. Black was able to exit the house.

In the second example when the first two doors were opened, there was open closed door in each of the exit.

With three doors opened Mr. Black was able to use the left exit.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and the sequence of opened doors is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 (indicating a door in the left exit) or 1 (indicating a door in the right exit), with at least one 0 and one 1 in the sequence.
def func():
    n = map(int, raw_input().split())
    n = n[0]
    c = map(int, raw_input().split())
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if c[i] != c[i + 1]:
            ans = i + 1
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the index of the first differing element from the end, or `0` if all elements are equal or if the loop does not execute.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `c` of integers (0s and 1s) representing opened doors. It checks for the first index from the end where the door type changes (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). If such a differing element exists, it returns the index of that element plus one; otherwise, it returns 0 if all elements are equal or if there are no differing elements.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
