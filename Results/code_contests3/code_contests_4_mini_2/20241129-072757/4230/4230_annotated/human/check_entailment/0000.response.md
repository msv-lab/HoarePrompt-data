The provided program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

### Explanation of the program's logic:
1. The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of doors and a list `c` which indicates the sequence in which the doors are opened (0 for left exit, 1 for right exit).
2. It then attempts to find the first index from the end of the list where the door type changes (i.e., from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
3. If such an index is found, it returns that index + 1 (to convert from 0-based to 1-based indexing).

### Why the program is incorrect:
- The problem description requires finding the smallest index `k` such that after opening the first `k` doors, Mr. Black can exit the house. Mr. Black can exit the house if all doors in at least one of the exits are open.
- The program is incorrectly looking for the first differing element from the end of the list, which does not relate to the requirement of having all doors in either exit open. Simply finding the first differing element does not ensure that all doors in one of the exits are fully opened at index `k`.

### Counterexample:
For the input:
```
5
0 1 0 1 0
```
The doors opened are:
- After opening the first door (0): Left exit not fully open.
- After opening the second door (1): Right exit not fully open.
- After opening the third door (0): Left exit not fully open.
- After opening the fourth door (1): Right exit not fully open.
- After opening the fifth door (0): Left exit is fully open.

The correct `k` should be 5, but the program would return 3 because it finds the first differing element from the end.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine when all doors in at least one exit are open, it fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
