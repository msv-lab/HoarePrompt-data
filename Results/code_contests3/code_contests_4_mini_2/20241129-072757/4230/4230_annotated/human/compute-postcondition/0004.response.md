According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `n - 2` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 2` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `n` must be at least `2`. 

Given that `n` is either `0` or `1`, it does not satisfy the condition to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be adjusted to at least `2`. The variable `i` will start from `n - 2`, so it should be `0` when `n` is `2`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
