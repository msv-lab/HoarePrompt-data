`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that after the last iteration `i` is -1, the value of `ans` will be -1 + 1, which equals 0. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is -1, `ans` is 0**
