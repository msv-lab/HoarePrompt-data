According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `n - 2` and decrements `i` in each iteration until it reaches -1. In the last iteration, `i` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, which means `i` was at least 0 (because `n - 2` is 0 or greater). If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented by 1, which means `i` will now be -1. 

Since the loop condition is `i >= 0`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must not be less than 0. Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `i` would need to be 0 or greater, which is not possible after the last iteration if `i` was 0.

State: **`n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again `i` must be at least 0, but after the last iteration `i` is -1, thus the loop cannot execute again.**
