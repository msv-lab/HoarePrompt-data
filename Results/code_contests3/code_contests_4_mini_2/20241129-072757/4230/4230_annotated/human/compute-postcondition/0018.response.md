The code `print(ans)` outputs the value of `ans` to the console. The value of `ans` is determined by the previous computations and its initial state is given as the index of the first differing element from the end or `0` if all elements are equal or if the loop does not execute. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the index of the first differing element from the end, or `0` if all elements are equal or if the loop does not execute.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the index of the first differing element from the end, or `0` if all elements are equal or if the loop does not execute.**
