`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the value of `ans` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables (`n` and the elements in `c`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `c` are not equal.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 1, `i` is 0, and the elements at index `i` and `i + 1` in `c` are not equal.**
