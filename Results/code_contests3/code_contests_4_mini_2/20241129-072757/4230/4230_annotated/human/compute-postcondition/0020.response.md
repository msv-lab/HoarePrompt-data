Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `c` of integers (0s and 1s) representing opened doors. It checks for the first index from the end where the door type changes (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). If such a differing element exists, it returns the index of that element plus one; otherwise, it returns 0 if all elements are equal or if there are no differing elements. **
