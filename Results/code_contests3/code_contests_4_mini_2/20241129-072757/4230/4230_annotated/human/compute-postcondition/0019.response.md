The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 200000, and a parameter `opened_doors`, which is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 (indicating a door in the left exit) or 1 (indicating a door in the right exit), with the condition that there is at least one 0 and one 1 in the sequence. The function processes these parameters and determines the specific output based on the sequence of opened doors. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `opened_doors`, and it returns an output based on the sequence of doors represented by the list.**
