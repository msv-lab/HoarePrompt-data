`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is -1, the calculation yields `ans = -1 + 1`, which results in `ans` being 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is -1**
