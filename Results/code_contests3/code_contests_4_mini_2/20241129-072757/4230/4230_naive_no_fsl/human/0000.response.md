Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the smallest index \( k \) such that all doors in at least one of the exits are open. 

### Explanation of the issues in the program:

1. **Incorrect Iteration Logic**: The program iterates from the end of the list of opened doors towards the start, looking for the first position where the door type changes (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0). This does not guarantee that all doors in either exit have been opened. The logic fails to check if all doors of one type (either all 0s or all 1s) have been opened as it only checks for a change between 0 and 1.

2. **Example where the logic fails**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     0 0 1 1 1
     ```
   - The expected output is `3`, because after opening the third door (the first `1`), Mr. Black can exit through the right exit (as there are 2 `0`s yet to be opened).
   - However, the program will incorrectly compute the index \( k \) as `2`, because it finds a change between `0` and `1` at index `2` and will not check whether all doors of one type have been opened.

3. **Lack of Proper Condition Check**: The program does not maintain a count of how many doors of each type have been opened and does not check against the total number of doors for each exit.

Given these points, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs, thus the correctness is evaluated as **False**.
