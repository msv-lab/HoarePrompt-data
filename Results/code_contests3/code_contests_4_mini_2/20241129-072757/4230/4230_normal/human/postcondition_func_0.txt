The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers representing opened doors, where each integer is either 0 (left exit) or 1 (right exit). It finds and returns the index of the last position where the door value differs from the next door value. If all doors have the same value, it returns 0. The function does not handle cases where input may not meet the specified constraints (e.g., if there are no 0s or 1s).
