The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `opened_doors`. The parameter `n` is an integer that meets the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `opened_doors` is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 (indicating a left exit) or 1 (indicating a right exit), and the list must contain at least one 0 and one 1.

The function processes these inputs and outputs the following results based on certain conditions:

- Case_1: If there are no left exits (0) in the `opened_doors` list, the function returns a message indicating that there are no left exits.
- Case_2: If there are no right exits (1) in the `opened_doors` list, the function returns a message indicating that there are no right exits.
- Case_3: If both left exits and right exits are present, the function returns a message indicating the presence of both exits.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `opened_doors`, and return messages based on the presence of left exits (0) and right exits (1) in the list of opened doors.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `opened_doors`, returns a message about the presence of left exits (0) and right exits (1) in the list.**
