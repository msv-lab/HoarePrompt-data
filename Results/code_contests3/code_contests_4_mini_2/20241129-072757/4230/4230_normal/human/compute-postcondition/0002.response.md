The code assigns `c` the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which reads a line of input, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. The variable `n`, which is the first element of the input list, is not directly modified by this line of code. However, `c` will store the integer values from the input list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the input list (either 0 or 1), `c` is a map object containing the integer values of the input list.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the input list (either 0 or 1), `c` is a map object containing the integer values of the input list.**
