According to the code, the loop will execute if `n - 2` is at least `0`, because the `range(n - 2, -1, -1)` function generates a sequence starting from `n - 2` down to `0` (inclusive). 

Given that `n` is either `0` or `1`, we can conclude:
- If `n` is `0`, then `n - 2` will be `-2`, and the loop will not execute.
- If `n` is `1`, then `n - 2` will be `-1`, and the loop will also not execute.

Since both possible values of `n` do not allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust `n` to be at least `2` for the loop to have any iterations. 

Additionally, since the loop variable `i` starts at `n - 2`, we need to initialize `i` to `n - 2`, which is `0` when `n` is adjusted to `2`.

State: **`n` is adjusted to be at least 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is `n - 2` (which is 0 if n is 2)**
