According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be decremented by 1, making it `n - 4`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is at least 2 (since `c[i]` must not equal `c[i + 1]`, ensuring that the condition holds). 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 4` for the loop to execute one more time.**
