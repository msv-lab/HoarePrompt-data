The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is adjusted to be at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
