`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 4`, this means `ans` will be `n - 4 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least `n - 3`, and `i` is `n - 4`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least `n - 3`, `i` is `n - 4**
