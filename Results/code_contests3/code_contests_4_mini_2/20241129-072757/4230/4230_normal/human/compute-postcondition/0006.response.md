The value of `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, this means `ans` will be `n - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is adjusted to be at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal. 

Output State: **`n` is adjusted to be at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, and the elements `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]` are not equal.**
