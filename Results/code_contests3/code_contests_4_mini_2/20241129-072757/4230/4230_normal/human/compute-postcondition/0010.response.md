`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is `n - 3`, we can express `ans` as `n - 3 + 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`. The value of `n` is at least 2, so `ans` will be at least `2 - 2 = 0`. The other variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is at least 0, `i` is `n - 3**
