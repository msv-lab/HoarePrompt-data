The variable `ans` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which is either 0 or 1, and `c`, which is a map object containing integer values from the input list. However, since `ans` is the only variable being affected and it is simply set to 0, the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the first element of the input list (either 0 or 1), `c` is a map object containing the integer values of the input list, `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of the input list (either 0 or 1), `c` is a map object containing the integer values of the input list, `ans` is 0**.
