According to the code, the loop executes while `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Thus, `i` becomes `n - 3`. 

We also know that `n` is at least 2, so `i` will be non-negative as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 3. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we must ensure that `n` is at least 3, and adjust `i` to `n - 3`. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `ans` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3.**
