The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and a list of tuples for each visitor containing `l_i` and `r_i`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors. Each tuple `(l_i, r_i)` contains two integers such that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`. 

The function processes these inputs and returns the number of flowers that are visited by at least one visitor. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a positive integer `n` representing the number of flowers, a positive integer `m` representing the number of visitors, and a list of visitor intervals defined by tuples `(l_i, r_i)`, then return the count of unique flowers that are visited by at least one visitor.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (number of flowers), a positive integer m (number of visitors), and a list of tuples (l_i, r_i) for each visitor. It returns the count of unique flowers that are visited by at least one visitor.**
