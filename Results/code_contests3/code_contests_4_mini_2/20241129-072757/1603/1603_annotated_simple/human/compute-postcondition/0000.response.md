The line of code assigns values to `n` and `m` by taking input from the user, where the input is expected to be two positive integers separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified in the initial state, so they are overwritten by the input values. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `n` and `m` are now set to the integers provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors, based on user input.**
