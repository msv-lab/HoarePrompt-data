The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (the number of flowers) and `m` (the number of visitors), and prints a string consisting of '10' repeated for each pair of flowers (for even `n`), and adds a '1' if `n` is odd. However, it does not actually count or track unique flowers visited by the visitors; instead, it only prints a pattern based on the value of `n`. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the stated goal regarding the visitors and unique flowers.
