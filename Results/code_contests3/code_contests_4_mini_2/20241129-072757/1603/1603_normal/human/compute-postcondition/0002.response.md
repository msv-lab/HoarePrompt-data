The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000), and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000). Each visitor is associated with a range `(l_i, r_i)`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. 

The function processes the ranges provided by the visitors and returns some output based on the interaction between the flowers and the visitors' ranges. Since the specific output details are not provided, we summarize the functionality based on the input parameters and the expected interactions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n (number of flowers) and m (number of visitors), and processes the ranges of each visitor to return a result based on the interaction between visitors and flowers.**
