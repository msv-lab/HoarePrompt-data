You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Sonya decided to organize an exhibition of flowers. Since the girl likes only roses and lilies, she decided that only these two kinds of flowers should be in this exhibition.

There are n flowers in a row in the exhibition. Sonya can put either a rose or a lily in the i-th position. Thus each of n positions should contain exactly one flower: a rose or a lily.

She knows that exactly m people will visit this exhibition. The i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive. The girl knows that each segment has its own beauty that is equal to the product of the number of roses and the number of lilies.

Sonya wants her exhibition to be liked by a lot of people. That is why she wants to put the flowers in such way that the sum of beauties of all segments would be maximum possible.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤ n, m≤ 10^3) — the number of flowers and visitors respectively.

Each of the next m lines contains two integers l_i and r_i (1≤ l_i≤ r_i≤ n), meaning that i-th visitor will visit all flowers from l_i to r_i inclusive.

Output

Print the string of n characters. The i-th symbol should be «0» if you want to put a rose in the i-th position, otherwise «1» if you want to put a lily.

If there are multiple answers, print any.

Examples

Input

5 3
1 3
2 4
2 5


Output

01100

Input

6 3
5 6
1 4
4 6


Output

110010

Note

In the first example, Sonya can put roses in the first, fourth, and fifth positions, and lilies in the second and third positions;

  * in the segment [1…3], there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 2=2; 
  * in the segment [2…4], there are one rose and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 2=2; 
  * in the segment [2…5], there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 2=4. 



The total beauty is equal to 2+2+4=8.

In the second example, Sonya can put roses in the third, fourth, and sixth positions, and lilies in the first, second, and fifth positions;

  * in the segment [5…6], there are one rose and one lily, so the beauty is equal to 1⋅ 1=1; 
  * in the segment [1…4], there are two roses and two lilies, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 2=4; 
  * in the segment [4…6], there are two roses and one lily, so the beauty is equal to 2⋅ 1=2. 



The total beauty is equal to 1+4+2=7.
