The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `m`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, and `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors. Additionally, for each visitor, there is a range specified by two integers `(l_i, r_i)` that denotes the indices of the flowers that the visitor is interested in, where the constraint is that `1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n`. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the defined logic. However, the specific output details are not provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of flowers and a positive integer `m` representing the number of visitors, along with ranges `(l_i, r_i)` for each visitor, and processes these inputs to return a result based on the logic defined in the function.**
