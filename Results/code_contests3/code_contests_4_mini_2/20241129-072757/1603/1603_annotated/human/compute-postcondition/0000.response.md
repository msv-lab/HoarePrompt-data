The code takes input values for `n` and `m` from the user, using the `raw_input()` function, which collects a string of input, and then `map(int, ...)` converts those string values into integers. The variable `n` will represent the number of flowers as a positive integer, and `m` will represent the number of visitors, also as a positive integer. Since the input values are provided by the user, the specific values for `n` and `m` are not known beforehand. Therefore, the output state reflects this uncertainty.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of flowers, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of visitors**
