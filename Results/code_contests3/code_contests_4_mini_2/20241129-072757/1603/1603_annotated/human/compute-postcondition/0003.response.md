Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers, `n` (number of flowers) and `m` (number of visitors), but it only processes the input for `n` to generate a string that consists of the digit '10' repeated `n // 2` times, and potentially a single '1' if `n` is odd. The parameter `m` and the ranges `(l_i, r_i)` for each visitor are provided as input but are not utilized in the function, indicating missing functionality related to visitor processing.**
