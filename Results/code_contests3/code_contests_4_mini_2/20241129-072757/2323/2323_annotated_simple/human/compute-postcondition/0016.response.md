Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a` (which is at least 1), `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0. The last digit of `a` is not 0, indicating that `a % 10` is not equal to 0.***
