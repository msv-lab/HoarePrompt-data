The function `func` accepts a parameter `stepan` which is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros. It also accepts a parameter `m`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8. The output of the function is not specified, but it can be inferred that it processes the string and integer in some manner based on the given constraints.

However, without specific output conditions provided, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, based on the provided constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `stepan` (which represents an integer without leading zeros) and an integer `m`. The string `stepan` has a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and `m` is an integer between 2 and 10^8.**
