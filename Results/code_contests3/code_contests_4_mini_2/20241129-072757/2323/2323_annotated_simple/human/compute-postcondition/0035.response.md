According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `i` has not yet reached `c`, meaning `i` is still less than `c`. 

Since `m` is an integer in the range of 2 to 10^8, it does not affect the loop execution directly. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `h` are updated based on the conditions provided, but for the loop, the important factor is the value of `i` and `c`. 

Assuming `i` was incremented by 1 after the last iteration, `i` would now be `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, for the loop to execute again `c` must be greater than `i + 1, and `i` is now `i + 1`.**
