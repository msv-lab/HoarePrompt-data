According to the code, the `while` loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero (truthy). Right before the loop, `copya` is assigned the value of `a`. For the loop to execute the first time, `copya` must be greater than 0. Since `a` is an input integer, it could potentially be 0, which would mean that `copya` would also be 0, thus preventing the loop from executing.

To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `a` must be adjusted to be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is a positive integer.

State: **Stepan's integer is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is assigned the value of `a`.**
