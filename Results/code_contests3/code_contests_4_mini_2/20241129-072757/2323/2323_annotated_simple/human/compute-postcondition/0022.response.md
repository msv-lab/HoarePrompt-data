`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which gives the last digit of `a`. Since it is stated that the last digit of `a` is 0, `h` will be 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a` (which is at least 1), `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of a % b, `i` is 0, and `h` is 0.
