The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which indicates that `h` will hold the remainder when `a` is divided by 10. The initial state suggests that `m` is an integer within a specific range, but this does not directly affect the calculation of `h`. The values of `c` and `i` do not impact the calculation here. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `h` is `a % 10`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `h` is `a % 10**
