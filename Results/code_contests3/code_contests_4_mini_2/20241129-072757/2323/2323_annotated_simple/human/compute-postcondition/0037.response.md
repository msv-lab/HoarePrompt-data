The variable `a` is floor divided by 10, which will reduce its value by a factor of 10. The specific previous value of `a` is not provided, but we know that `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10. The value of `h` will not change as it is based on the previous value of `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` has been updated but does not specify the new value without knowing the previous state of `a`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `h` is the remainder of `a` divided by 10; `a` is now floor divided by 10.**
