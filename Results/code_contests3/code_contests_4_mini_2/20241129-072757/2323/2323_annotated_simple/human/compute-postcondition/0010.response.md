According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue as long as `copya` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is calculated as `a // 100`. For the loop to execute again, `copya` must be greater than 0, which means `a` must be at least 100 (since `copya` is the integer division of `a` by 100). 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again, `a` must be adjusted to be at least 100. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be at least 100; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is `a // 100`**
