`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `a % b`. The value of `a` is now 10, but the value of `b` is not specified in the initial state. Since `b` is not defined, we cannot compute `a % b`. Therefore, the output state mentions the known values and indicates that the minimum cannot be calculated without `b`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `i` is 1; `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10; `a` is 10; the value of `b` is not defined, so `ans` cannot be calculated.**
