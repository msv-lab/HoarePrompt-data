According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue executing as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` has been defined as `a // 10`. Since `copya` is currently non-zero, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be greater than or equal to 10. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is adjusted accordingly.

State: **Stepan's integer is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 10`**
