`copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`. The previous value of `copya` is `a // 100`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, after executing the operation, `copya` will be reduced to `copya // 10`, which is effectively `(a // 100) // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer, the specific value of `copya` now depends on the actual value of `a`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is now `(a // 100) // 10`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is now `(a // 100) // 10**
