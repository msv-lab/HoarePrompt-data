The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since `c` is initially 2, after execution, `c` will be 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 3; `copya` is now `(a // 100) // 10`.
