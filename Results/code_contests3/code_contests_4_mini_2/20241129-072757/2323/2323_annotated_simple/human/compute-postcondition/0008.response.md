The value of `copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`. Since `copya` is initialized as `a // 10`, it will be updated to `(a // 10) // 10`, which is equivalent to `a // 100`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `copya`.

Output State: **`Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `a // 100`**
