The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, which computes the last digit of `a`. Since `a` is a positive integer and the last digit is not 0, `h` will hold a value between 1 and 9, inclusive. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, and `h` is the last digit of `a` which is `a % 10`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the number of digits in the original `a`, `copya` is 0, `ans` is the result of `a % b`, `i` is 0, `h` is the last digit of `a` which is `a % 10`.**
