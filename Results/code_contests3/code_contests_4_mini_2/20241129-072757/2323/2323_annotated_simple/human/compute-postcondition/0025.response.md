Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8. If the last digit of `a` is not zero, `a` is updated to have the last digit `h` appended, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `a % b`, while `copya` remains 0 and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `a` is modified to `a // 10`, `ans` is updated to the result of `a % b`, `copya` is still 0, and `i` remains 0, with `h` being 0.***
