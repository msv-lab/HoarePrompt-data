The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since `c` was initially 1, after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Stepan's integer` is a string of digits with a length between 2 and 200,000, inclusive, and does not contain leading zeros; `m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than or equal to 10; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is `a // 100`.
