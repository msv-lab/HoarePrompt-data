According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the variable `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

State: **`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8, for the loop to execute a second time `c` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1.**
