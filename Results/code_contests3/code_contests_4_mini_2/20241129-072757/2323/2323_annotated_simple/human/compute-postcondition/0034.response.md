Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `m` ≤ 10^8; if `a % 10` is not equal to 0, then `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, `a` is set to 10, and the value of `b` is not defined, so `ans` cannot be calculated. Otherwise, `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`, `a` is updated to `a // 10`, and `a` is set to 10.***
