The function accepts two integer inputs, `a` and `b`, where `a` is a positive integer and `b` is an integer between 2 and 10^8. The function calculates and prints the minimum value of `a % b` after attempting to rearrange the digits of `a`. It considers all possible arrangements by moving non-zero digits to the front, but only modifies `a` when the last digit is non-zero. If all digits are zero, the function does not handle this case explicitly, as it assumes that `a` will always be a valid positive integer input with no leading zeros.
