The function accepts two inputs: a positive integer `a` and an integer `b`. It calculates the minimum remainder of `a` when divided by `b` after modifying `a` by rotating its digits. The function considers all possible rotations of the digits of `a` (leftmost non-zero digit to the front) and finds the minimum remainder when each modified version of `a` is divided by `b`. The result is printed as output.
