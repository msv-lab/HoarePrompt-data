The value of `a` is not defined in the initial state, so performing the operation `a //= 10` will not change any variables. The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `h` is assigned the value from an undefined `a`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `h` is assigned the value from an undefined `a`.**
