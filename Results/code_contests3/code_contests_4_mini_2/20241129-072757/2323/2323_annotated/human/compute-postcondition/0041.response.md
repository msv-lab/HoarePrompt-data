The operation `a //= 10` attempts to perform an integer division on `a`, which is currently undefined. Therefore, the operation cannot be executed, and no changes occur to any of the variables. The value of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `a` is undefined; no changes were made.**
