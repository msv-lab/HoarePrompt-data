`c` is incremented by 1. The value of `c` is increased, but the previous value of `c` is unknown. The states of the other variables, `a` and `copya`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than or equal to 100; `copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10; `c` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than or equal to 100; `copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10; `c` is increased by 1.**
