Postcondition: ***`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, if `a` is not a multiple of 10, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of `ans` and the remainder of 10 divided by `b`. Otherwise, `a` is divided by 10, `ans` remains the remainder of the original `a` divided by `b`, and `h` is set to 0.***
