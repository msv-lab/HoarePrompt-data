The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that the last digit of `a` is 0, `a % 10` will equal 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `h` is 0**
