The value of `h` is derived from an undefined variable `a`, which means `h` is also undefined. The expression `10 ** c` evaluates to a positive integer since `c` is greater than 0. Therefore, the outcome of `10 ** c * h` remains undefined due to `h` being undefined. The value of `a` on the right side of the assignment is also undefined. As a result, `a` cannot be updated because both sides of the equation involve undefined values.

The states of the other variables (`copya`, `c`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `h` is undefined, and `a` cannot be updated due to undefined values.**
