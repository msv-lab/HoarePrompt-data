According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is defined as `(a // 10) // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer, `copya` will be positive only if `a` is greater than or equal to 100. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `a` must be at least 100. 

If `a` is less than 100, then `copya` will be zero, and the loop will not execute again. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the condition about `a`.

State: **`a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than or equal to 100**
