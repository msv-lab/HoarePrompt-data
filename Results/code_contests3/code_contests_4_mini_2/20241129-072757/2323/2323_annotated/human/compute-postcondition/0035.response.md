According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `c`. If `i` is less than `c`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `c` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `c` must be greater than 2.

State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
