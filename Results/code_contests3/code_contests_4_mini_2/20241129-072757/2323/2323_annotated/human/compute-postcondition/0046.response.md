The function `func` accepts two parameters: a string representing a positive integer (let's denote it as `num_str`) with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits, and an integer `m` where \(2 \leq m \leq 10^8\). 

The function processes these inputs and returns a specific result based on certain conditions. However, without specific cases provided in the output detail, we can summarize the functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `num_str` representing a positive integer and an integer `m`, and it performs computations based on these inputs, returning a specific result that is dependent on their values.**
