According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will execute as long as `copya` is non-zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is equal to `a // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer, `copya` would be non-zero as long as `a` is greater than or equal to 10. For the loop to execute again, `copya` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `a` must be at least 10.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is now `a // 10 and for the loop to execute again a must be at least 10**
