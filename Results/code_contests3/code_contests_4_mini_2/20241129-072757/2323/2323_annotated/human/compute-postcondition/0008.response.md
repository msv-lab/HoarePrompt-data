The value of `copya` is updated by performing an integer division by 10. The previous value of `copya` is `a // 10`, which means `copya` will now be equal to `(a // 10) // 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer and for the loop to execute again `a` must be at least 10, `copya` will remain a non-negative integer. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is now `(a // 10) // 10**
