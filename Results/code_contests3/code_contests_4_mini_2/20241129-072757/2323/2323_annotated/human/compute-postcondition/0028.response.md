The code `a //= 10` performs an integer division of `a` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `a`. The variable `h`, which is equal to `a % 10`, will not be affected by this operation since it is based on the value of `a` before the division. 

However, we do not have the initial value of `a` provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `a` after the operation, but we can specify that `a` is now reduced by a factor of 10.

The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `h` is equal to `a % 10; `a` is now reduced by a factor of 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `h` is equal to `a % 10; `a` is now reduced by a factor of 10.**
