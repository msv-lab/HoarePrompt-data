The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 1, so after execution, `c` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is now `(a // 10) // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 2, `copya` is now `(a // 10) // 10**
