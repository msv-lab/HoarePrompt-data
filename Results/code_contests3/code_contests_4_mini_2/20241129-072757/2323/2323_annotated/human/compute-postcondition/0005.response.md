`copya` is assigned the value of `copya // 10`, where `//` is the floor division operator. Since `copya` is equal to `a`, the new value of `copya` will be `a // 10`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is now `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is now `a // 10**
