The value of `a` is assigned the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. However, since `a` is not defined, the expression cannot be evaluated. The values of `copya`, `c`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `h` cannot be determined because `a` is not defined.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `h` cannot be determined because `a` is not defined.**
