The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The previous values of `a` (a positive integer) and `b` (an input integer) remain unchanged, as the code only modifies `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0**
