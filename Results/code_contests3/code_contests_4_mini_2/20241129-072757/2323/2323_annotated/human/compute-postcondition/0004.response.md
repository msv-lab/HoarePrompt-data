According to the code, the `while` loop can execute as long as `copya` is not equal to 0. Since `copya` is stated to be equal to `a`, and `a` is a positive integer, `copya` will also be positive (greater than 0). Therefore, the loop can execute at least one time without any adjustments since `copya` is already greater than 0.

State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is a positive integer (equal to `a`)**
