The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is now `a // 10`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 1, `copya` is now `a // 10**
