`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since `a` is a positive integer and not divisible by 10, `h` will be the last digit of `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `c` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `ans` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, and `h` is the last digit of `a`.
