`copya` is assigned the value of `a`, which is a positive integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is a positive integer (equal to `a`).

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `copya` is a positive integer (equal to `a`)**
