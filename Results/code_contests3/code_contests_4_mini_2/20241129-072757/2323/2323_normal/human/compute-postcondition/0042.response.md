The value of `a` is updated using the expression `10 ** c * h + a`. Given that `c` is at least 3, `h` is 0, and `a` is now 1, we can calculate the new value of `a`. 

Calculating:
- `10 ** c` where `c` is at least 3 results in at least `1000`.
- Thus, `10 ** c * h` equals `1000 * 0`, which is `0`.
- Therefore, `a` becomes `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

Since the value of `a` remains `1`, and no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is:

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**
