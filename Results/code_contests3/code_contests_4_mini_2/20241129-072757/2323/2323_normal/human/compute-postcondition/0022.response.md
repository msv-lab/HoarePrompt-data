`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that `a % 10` is equal to 0, `h` will be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `h` is 0.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `h` is 0**
