According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `c`. In the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `c` is at least 2, meaning the loop can execute again. Since `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, it will become 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must remain at least 3 (to allow for `i` to be less than `c`).

State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is the last digit of `a`, and `a` is updated to 10.**
