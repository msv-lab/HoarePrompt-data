`c` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `c` becomes 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 3; `copya` is divided by 10.
