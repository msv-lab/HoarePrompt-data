Functionality: ** The function accepts two inputs: a positive integer represented as a string (Stepan's integer) and an integer m (where 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^8). It computes and prints the minimum value of the integer formed by permutations of the digits of Stepan's integer modulo m. The function considers all possible single-digit rotations of the number, ensuring that leading zeros are handled correctly. It does not return any value, as it directly prints the result instead. **
