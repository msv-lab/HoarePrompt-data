The value of `a` is updated using the formula `10 ** c * h + a`. Given that `c` is at least 3, `h` is 0, and `a` is 1, we calculate:

- `10 ** c` with `c` being at least 3 gives us `1000` when `c` is 3 (since `10 ** 3 = 1000`).
- Therefore, `10 ** c * h` is `1000 * 0 = 0`.
- Adding `a` (which is 1) gives `0 + 1 = 1`.

However, since `h` is 0, the expression simplifies to just `a`, resulting in no change to `a`. Thus, `a` remains 1.

The other variables (`copya`, `ans`, `c`, `i`) are unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 1**.
