According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. If `copya` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `copya` is equal to `a`. Since `a` is an input integer, it is assumed to be positive. This means `copya` will be non-zero, allowing the loop to execute at least once.

Since `copya` is assigned the value of `a` and `a` is a positive integer, there is no need to adjust any states to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **Stepan's integer is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 0; `copya` is `a`**
