The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. The value of `a` is unchanged, but since `a` is not specified, `h` will take on the value of the last digit of whatever `a` is. The states of the other variables (`copya`, `ans`, `c`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `ans` remains updated to the minimum of `ans` and `10 % b` or `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `h` is `a % 10`.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` remains updated to the minimum of `ans` and `10 % b` or `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `h` is `a % 10`.**
