The value of `h` is assigned the last digit of `a` using the expression `a % 10`. Since `a` is updated to 10, the value of `h` will be `10 % 10`, which equals 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, and `a` is updated to 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is updated to 10.**
