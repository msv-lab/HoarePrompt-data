The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `c` is 0, so after execution, `c` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 1; `copya` is `copya // 10`.
