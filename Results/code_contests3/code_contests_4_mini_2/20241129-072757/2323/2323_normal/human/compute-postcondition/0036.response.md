The variable `h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Given that `a` is updated to 10, the calculation for `h` becomes `10 % 10`, which equals `0`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, and `a` is 10.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, otherwise `ans` remains as `a % b`, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, `a` is 10**
