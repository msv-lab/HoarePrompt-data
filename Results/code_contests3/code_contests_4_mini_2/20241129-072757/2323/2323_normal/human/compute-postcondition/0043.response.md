Postcondition: ***`copya` is 0, `c` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `h` is 0, and `a` is 1. If `a` is not a multiple of 10, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `1 % b`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `10 % b` if `a` is not a multiple of 10, or remains as `a % b`.***
