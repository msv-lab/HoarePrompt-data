`h` is assigned the value of `a % 10`. Since the last digit of `a` is not 0, `h` will be a non-zero value. The values of `copya`, `ans`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `h` is equal to `a % 10`, which is a non-zero value.

Output State: **`copya` is 0, `ans` is `a % b`, `c` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `h` is a non-zero value**
