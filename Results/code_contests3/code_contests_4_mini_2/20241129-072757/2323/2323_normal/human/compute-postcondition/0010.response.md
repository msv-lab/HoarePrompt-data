According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `copya`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `copya` is not zero. At the end of the last iteration, `copya` is divided by 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `copya` must be greater than 0 before the division by 10 occurs. Since `copya` is currently divided by 10, it must have been at least 10 before the last iteration to ensure that it can still be greater than 0 after the division. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `copya` must have been at least 10 at the end of the previous iteration. 

State: **Stepan's integer is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; and for the loop to execute again `copya` must have been at least 10**.
