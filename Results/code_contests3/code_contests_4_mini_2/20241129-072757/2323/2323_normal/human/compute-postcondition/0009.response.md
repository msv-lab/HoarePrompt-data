The value of `c` is incremented by 1, and since `c` is initially 1, it becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: Stepan's integer is a string representing a positive integer with a length between 2 and 200,000 digits; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `c` is 2; `copya` is divided by 10.
