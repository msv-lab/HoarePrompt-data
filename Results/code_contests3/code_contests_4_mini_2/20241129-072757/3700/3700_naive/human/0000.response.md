Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of Attack actions needed for Fennec to win against the monsters. 

Here are the specific issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the input in a way that does not match the problem description. It expects the first line to contain "N K" and the second line to contain the health of the monsters. Instead, it reads the health into `s`, which is not relevant to the problem being solved.

2. **Logical Errors**: The program checks if the sum of the healths of the monsters (`s`) is greater than or equal to `H`. However, this logic is incorrect because `H` is not defined properly in this context. The program does not account for how many Special Moves Fennec can use or how many Attack actions are required after using the Special Moves.

3. **Output Logic**: The program outputs "Yes" or "No" instead of the minimum number of Attack actions required, which is the actual requirement of the problem.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 1
4 1 5
```

The expected output is `5`, but the program would not produce this output due to the issues mentioned above.

Overall, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
