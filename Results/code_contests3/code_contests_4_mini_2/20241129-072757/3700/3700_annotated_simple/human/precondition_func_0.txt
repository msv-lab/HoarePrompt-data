a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the number of special moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and H is a list of integers representing the health of each monster such that each element H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
