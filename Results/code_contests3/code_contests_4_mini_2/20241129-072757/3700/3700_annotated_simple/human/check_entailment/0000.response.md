The provided program does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The problem description requires calculating the minimum number of attack actions needed for Fennec to defeat all monsters given their health and a limited number of special moves. The goal is to determine how many attack actions are needed after effectively using the special moves.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: 
   - `func_1` simply returns a modified sum of `a` (number of monsters) and `b` (number of special moves) without any consideration of the monsters' health. This function does not address the problem's requirement to calculate attacks needed based on the health of monsters.
   - `func_2` tries to check if the sum of healths equals or exceeds some value, but it does not perform any calculations relevant to the number of attacks needed. It checks if the sum of health is greater than or equal to the maximum health, which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Missing Core Calculations**: The program lacks the necessary calculations to determine how many attack actions are needed based on the health values of the monsters after using the allowed special moves. It does not consider the health of individual monsters or how many special moves can be effectively utilized to mitigate attack actions.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated. 

Correctness: **False**
