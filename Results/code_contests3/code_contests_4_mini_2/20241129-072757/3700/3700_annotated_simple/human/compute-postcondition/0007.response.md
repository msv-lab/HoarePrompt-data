The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `H`. `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and `H` is a list of `N` integers where each `H[i]` satisfies 1 <= H[i] <= 10^9. 

The function returns a value based on these parameters. However, the specific return behavior is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `N`, a non-negative integer `K`, and a list of integers `H`, and return a result based on these inputs, which may involve some processing on `H` influenced by `N` and `K`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (integer), K (non-negative integer), and H (list of integers), and returns a result based on the values and constraints of these parameters.**
