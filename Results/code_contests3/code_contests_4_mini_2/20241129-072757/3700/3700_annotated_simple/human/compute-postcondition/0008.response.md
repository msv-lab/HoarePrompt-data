Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer N, reads a list of N integers H, and calculates the sum of these integers. It then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to the maximum value in H; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not use the parameter K, and the output depends solely on the sum of the integers in H compared to the maximum value in H.**
