#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the number of special moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and H is a list of integers representing the health of each monster such that each element H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer (1 <= a <= 200000), `b` is a non-negative integer (0 <= b <= 200000), and `c` is an integer (1 <= c <= 400000). If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod` while `H` remains a list of integers (1 <= H_i <= 10^9). If `c` is less than `mod`, no changes are made to `c` or `H`.
    return c
    #The program returns the integer c, which remains unchanged if c is less than mod, or decreased by mod if c is greater than or equal to mod.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers, `a` (number of monsters) and `b` (number of special moves), and returns an integer `c`, which is the sum of `a` and `b`. If this sum is greater than or equal to `mod`, it returns the result of the sum decreased by `mod`. If `c` is less than `mod`, it returns `c` unchanged. However, the function does not handle cases where `mod` is not defined within this function context, which may lead to an error.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of N integers where each H[i] satisfies 1 <= H[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers, `N` is the number of integers in `H`, and `s` is the sum of the integers in `H`. If `s` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the maximum value in `H`, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer N, reads a list of N integers H, and calculates the sum of these integers. It then prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to the maximum value in H; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not use the parameter K, and the output depends solely on the sum of the integers in H compared to the maximum value in H.
