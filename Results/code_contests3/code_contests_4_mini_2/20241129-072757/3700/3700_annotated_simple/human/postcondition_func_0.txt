The function accepts two non-negative integers, `a` (number of monsters) and `b` (number of special moves), and returns an integer `c`, which is the sum of `a` and `b`. If this sum is greater than or equal to `mod`, it returns the result of the sum decreased by `mod`. If `c` is less than `mod`, it returns `c` unchanged. However, the function does not handle cases where `mod` is not defined within this function context, which may lead to an error.
