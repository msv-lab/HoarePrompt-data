Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as outlined in the description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program attempts to read the inputs using `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3. Instead, it should use `input()`.

2. **Logic Errors**: The program defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but `func_1` is never called, and `func_2` does not implement the required logic to calculate the minimum number of attacks.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The logic inside `func_2` checks if the sum of health points is greater than or equal to some variable `H`, which is not relevant to the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attacks needed after using special moves, which is not addressed in the code.

4. **Special Moves**: The program does not take into account the number of special moves (K) available, which is a critical factor in solving the problem.

For example, given the input:
```
3 1
4 1 5
```
The expected output is `5`, as Fennec can make one special move to reduce one monster's health to zero, and then must attack the remaining monsters to bring their health to zero. The current program does not compute this correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem requirements.
