The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of monsters and the maximum number of Special Moves, respectively. It calculates their sum `c`. If `c` is greater than or equal to a predefined constant `mod`, it subtracts `mod` from `c`. The function then returns the adjusted value of `c`, which is the sum of `a` and `b`, potentially reduced by `mod` if the sum exceeds `mod`.
