The function accepts an integer `N` and reads a list of integers from input. It computes the sum of another list of integers and checks if this sum is greater than or equal to the integer `H`, printing 'Yes' if it is, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not utilize `K` and interprets `H` as a single integer, not a list.
