The function `func_2` accepts an integer `N` (the number of elements in a list), and a list `H` of integers, but it does not explicitly accept `K` as a parameter, instead assuming input from the user. The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains `H` and `N`, and the second line contains a list of integers. It calculates the sum of the integers from the second line and compares this sum (`s`) against the value of `H`. If `s` is greater than or equal to `H`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a discrepancy in the annotations: the code does not actually handle `K`, and `H` is treated as a single integer rather than a list. The function effectively checks if the sum of the second line of integers is sufficient compared to the integer `H`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` and reads a list of integers from input. It computes the sum of another list of integers and checks if this sum is greater than or equal to the integer `H`, printing 'Yes' if it is, and 'No' otherwise. The function does not utilize `K` and interprets `H` as a single integer, not a list. **
