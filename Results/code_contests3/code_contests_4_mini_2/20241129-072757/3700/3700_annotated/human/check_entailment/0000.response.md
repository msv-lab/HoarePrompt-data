Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Function 1**: The function calculates the sum of the number of monsters and the maximum number of Special Moves but does not perform any relevant computation needed to solve the problem. It does not contribute to determining the minimum number of Attack actions required, which is the main goal of the problem description.

2. **Function 2**: This function does not handle the input as specified in the problem description. It reads two integers but interprets them incorrectly; `H` should be a list of monster healths, but in the function, it is treated as a single integer. Moreover, the function checks if the sum of some other list of integers is greater than or equal to `H`, which is not related to the task of calculating the minimum number of Attack actions needed to win the game.

3. **Missing Logic**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of Attack actions needed while using Special Moves optimally. The logic to compute this is entirely absent from both functions.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not account for edge cases where K is zero or where there are monsters with very high health values that cannot be covered by the Special Moves.

In summary, the functions provided do not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described and do not utilize the inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
