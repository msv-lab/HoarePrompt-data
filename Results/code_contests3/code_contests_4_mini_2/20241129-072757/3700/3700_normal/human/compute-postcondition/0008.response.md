Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, H and N, and computes the sum of a list of integers provided via input. It prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not utilize the parameter N in any way, and it assumes that the sum of the list of integers must be compared against H. There is no handling for edge cases related to the input format or potential errors in input. **
