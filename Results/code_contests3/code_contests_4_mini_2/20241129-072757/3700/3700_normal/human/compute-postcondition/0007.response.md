The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `H`. `N` is an integer that must be between 1 and 200,000, inclusive. `K` is a non-negative integer that can be between 0 and 200,000, inclusive. `H` is a list of integers where each integer in the list satisfies the condition that it is between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive. 

The function does not have any specified output conditions or return values provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the available information, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 200000), a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 200000), and a list of integers H (1 <= H_i <= 10^9 for each H_i in H).**
