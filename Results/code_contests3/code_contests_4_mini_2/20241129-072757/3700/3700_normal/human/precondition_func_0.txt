a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of special moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and both a and b are followed by a list of integers representing the health of each monster (H_i) where 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
