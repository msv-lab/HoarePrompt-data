The provided code does not align with the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of attacks Fennec needs to perform before winning the fight against monsters, given that she can use a special move a limited number of times. The functions, however, do not implement this logic.

Function number 1 (`func_1`) simply adds two numbers and adjusts for a modulus that is not defined in the function's scope. This does not relate at all to the problem's requirements about attacking monsters.

Function number 2 (`func_2`) reads input values for health and the number of monsters, calculates the sum of the healths, and compares that sum against the health threshold H. This function also does not address the task of counting the minimum number of attacks needed before winning. 

Moreover, neither function considers the special moves Fennec can make, which is crucial to solving the problem. The problem clearly requires a calculation based on the provided health values, the number of monsters, and the number of special moves, yet the code does not attempt to implement this at all.

In terms of edge cases:
- The code does not handle scenarios where `K` is greater than or equal to the total health of all monsters, where Fennec would not need to attack at all.
- The code also does not account for varying health levels of the monsters or the strategic use of special moves to minimize the number of attacks.

Given these points, the output hints also do not agree with the core requirement of the problem since they describe unrelated computations.

Correctness: **False**. The program fails to implement the required logic to calculate the minimum number of attacks needed, does not handle edge cases, and does not follow the problem description.
