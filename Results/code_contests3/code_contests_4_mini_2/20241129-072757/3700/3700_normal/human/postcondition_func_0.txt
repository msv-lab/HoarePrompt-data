The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of special moves), and returns the sum of `a` and `b`, adjusted to be less than a certain modulus `mod` if the sum is greater than or equal to `mod`. Note that the function does not utilize or define `mod` within its scope, which may lead to an error if `mod` is not defined in the surrounding context.
