#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters (N) such that 1 <= a <= 200000, b is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of special moves (K) such that 0 <= b <= 200000, and both a and b are followed by a list of integers representing the health of each monster (H_i) where 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    c = a + b
    if (c >= mod) :
        c -= mod
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a non-negative integer representing the number of monsters such that 1 <= `a` <= 200000; `b` is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of special moves such that 0 <= `b` <= 200000; `c` is equal to `a + b`. If `c` is greater than or equal to `mod`, then `c` is decreased by `mod`.
    return c
    #The program returns the value of c, which is equal to a plus b, adjusted to be less than mod if necessary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` (the number of monsters) and `b` (the maximum number of special moves), and returns the sum of `a` and `b`, adjusted to be less than a certain modulus `mod` if the sum is greater than or equal to `mod`. Note that the function does not utilize or define `mod` within its scope, which may lead to an error if `mod` is not defined in the surrounding context.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 200000, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 200000, and H is a list of integers where each integer H_i satisfies 1 <= H_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    H, N = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    s = sum([int(x) for x in raw_input().split()])
    if (s >= H) :
        print('Yes')
    else :
        print('No')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`H` is a list of integers, `N` is an integer, and `s` is the sum of integers from raw input. If `s` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `H`, 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is less than the sum of the elements in `H`, 'No' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, H and N, and computes the sum of a list of integers provided via input. It prints 'Yes' if the sum is greater than or equal to H, otherwise it prints 'No'. The function does not utilize the parameter N in any way, and it assumes that the sum of the list of integers must be compared against H. There is no handling for edge cases related to the input format or potential errors in input.
