Output State: **`a` is an input string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list created from splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, `i` is `int(B) - 1`, `C` is a list of characters representing the string of `i`, and `ans` is the count of integers between `A` and `B` (exclusive) where the first and fifth digits are the same and the second and fourth digits are the same. If `int(A)` is greater than or equal to `int(B)`, then `ans` remains 1 if `A` and `B` are equal when converted to integers or 0 otherwise.**
