Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs as strings, compares them, and initializes a counter. It then counts the number of integers between the two inputs (exclusive) whose first and last digits are the same, and whose second and fourth digits are also the same. If the first two inputs are equal, it starts counting from 1; otherwise, it starts counting from 0. If the first input is greater than or equal to the second, the function will output 1 (if they are equal) or 0 (if they are not equal). The function does not handle invalid inputs or non-integer values. **
