Postcondition: ***`a` is an input string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list created from splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 2`, and `C` is a list of characters from the string representation of `i`. If `C[0]` is equal to `C[4]` and `C[1]` is equal to `C[3]`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.***
