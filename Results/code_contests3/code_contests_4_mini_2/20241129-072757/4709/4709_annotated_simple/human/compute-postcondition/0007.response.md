Postcondition: ***`a` is an input string representing one of the rows of the grid, `l` is a list created from splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, and `ans` is set to 1 if `A` and `B` are equal when converted to integers. If `A` and `B` are not equal, `ans` remains 0.***
