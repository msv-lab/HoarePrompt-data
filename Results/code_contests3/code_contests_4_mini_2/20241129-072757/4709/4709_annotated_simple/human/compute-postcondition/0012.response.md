Postcondition: ***`a` is an input string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list created from splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, `i` is `int(A)`, and `C` is a list of the string representation of `i`. If the first element of `C` is equal to the fifth element of `C` and the second element of `C` is equal to the fourth element of `C`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.***
