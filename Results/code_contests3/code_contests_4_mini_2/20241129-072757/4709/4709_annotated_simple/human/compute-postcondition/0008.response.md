According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop will execute if `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`. If `A` and `B` are equal, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute. 

Before the loop starts, `ans` is set to 1 if `A` and `B` are equal when converted to integers; otherwise, `ans` remains 0. This means, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `A` and `B` are not equal, which translates to `int(A) < int(B)`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are that `A` must not be equal to `B` when converted to integers, and we need to initialize `i` to be `int(A)` for the loop to execute.

State: **`a` is an input string representing one of the rows of the grid, `l` is a list created from splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, for the loop to execute the first time `int(A) < int(B)` and `i` is `int(A)`**
