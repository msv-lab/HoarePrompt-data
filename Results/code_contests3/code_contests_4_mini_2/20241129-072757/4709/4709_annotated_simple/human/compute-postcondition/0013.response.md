According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(B)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(A)`, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Given that the loop is defined to run `for i in range(int(A), int(B))`, after the last iteration, `i` will be `int(A) + 1` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `int(A) + 1` must be less than `int(B)`. Therefore, `int(B)` must be greater than `int(A) + 1`.

State: **`a` is an input string representing a row of the grid, `l` is a list created from splitting `a`, `A` is the first element of `l`, `B` is the second element of `l`, `i` is `int(A) + 1`, for the loop to execute a second time `int(B)` must be greater than `int(A) + 1**
