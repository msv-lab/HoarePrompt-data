`B` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `l`, which is `l[1]`. The variable `l` was created by splitting the input string `a`, so `l` contains the elements derived from `a`. The value of `A` remains unaffected as it is the first element of `l`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input string representing one of the rows of the grid; `l` is a list created from splitting `a`; `A` is the first element of `l`; `B` is the second element of `l`.

Output State: **`a` is an input string representing one of the rows of the grid; `l` is a list created from splitting `a`; `A` is the first element of `l`; `B` is the second element of `l`**.
