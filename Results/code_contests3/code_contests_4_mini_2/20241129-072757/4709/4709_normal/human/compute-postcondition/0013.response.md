According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `A` and `B`. The loop executes as long as `i` is less than `B`, starting from `int(A)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(A)`, which is the starting point, and it continues until `i` reaches `int(B)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `int(A) + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `int(A) + 1` must be less than `int(B)`.

State: **`a` is a string of 3 lowercase English letters, `l` is a list obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first character of `a`, `B` is the second character of `a`, `i` is `int(A) + 1`, for the loop to execute again `int(A) + 1` must be less than `int(B)`**
