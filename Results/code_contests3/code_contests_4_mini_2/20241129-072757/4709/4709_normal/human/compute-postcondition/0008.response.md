To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the variables `A`, `B`, and `i`.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(A), int(B)):`. This means that the loop will execute if and only if `int(A)` is less than `int(B)`. 
2. If `int(A)` is equal to `int(B)`, then the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The values of `A` and `B` are characters derived from the string `a`. Since `a` is a string of 3 lowercase English letters, `A` and `B` will be the first and second characters of this string respectively.
4. The integer values of `A` and `B` depend on their ASCII values, which will determine the behavior of the loop.

For the loop to execute at least once:
- `int(A)` must be less than `int(B)`. This means `A` must be less than `B` in terms of their ASCII values.
- The initial value of `i` will be `int(A)` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are:

State: **`a` is a string of 3 lowercase English letters, `l` is a list obtained by splitting `a`, `A` is the first character of `a`, `B` is the second character of `a`, for the loop to execute the first time `int(A) < int(B)` and `i` is `int(A)`**
