The function accepts a string input consisting of two space-separated integers. It counts how many integers in the range between the first integer (inclusive) and the second integer (exclusive) satisfy the condition where the first and last characters of their string representation are equal, and the second and second-to-last characters are equal. It prints the count of such integers. The function does not handle invalid input cases or ensure that the inputs are within valid ranges.
