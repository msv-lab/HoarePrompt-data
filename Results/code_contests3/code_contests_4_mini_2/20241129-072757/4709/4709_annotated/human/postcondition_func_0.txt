The function reads two integer values from a string input, compares them, and initializes a counter. It then iterates through the range between these two integers, counting how many numbers have the property that the first digit equals the fifth digit and the second digit equals the fourth digit when represented as a string. Finally, it prints the count. The function does not handle any input validation or error handling, so it assumes valid input is provided.
