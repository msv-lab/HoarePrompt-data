You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: We have a 3Ã—3 square grid, where each square contains a lowercase English letters. The letter in the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left is c_{ij}.

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters in the squares on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Constraints

* Input consists of lowercase English letters.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


c_{11}c_{12}c_{13}
c_{21}c_{22}c_{23}
c_{31}c_{32}c_{33}


Output

Print the string of length 3 that can be obtained by concatenating the letters on the diagonal connecting the top-left and bottom-right corner of the grid, from the top-left to bottom-right.

Examples

Input

ant
obe
rec


Output

abc


Input

edu
cat
ion


Output

ean
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, represented as three strings of length 3.
def func():
    a = raw_input()
    l = a.split()
    A = l[0]
    B = l[1]
    ans = 0
    if (int(A) == int(B)) :
        ans = 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing the split elements of that grid, `A` is the first element of the list `l`, `B` is the second element of the list `l`, and `ans` is 1 if the integer values of `A` and `B` are equal.
    for i in range(int(A), int(B)):
        C = list(str(i))
        
        if C[0] == C[4] and C[1] == C[3]:
            ans += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters, `l` is a list containing at least 2 split elements of that grid, `A` is the first element of the list `l`, `B` is the second element of the list `l`, `ans` is the count of integers in the range from `int(A)` to `int(B)` that have the property where the first character equals the fifth character and the second character equals the fourth character when represented as strings.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integer values from a string input, compares them, and initializes a counter. It then iterates through the range between these two integers, counting how many numbers have the property that the first digit equals the fifth digit and the second digit equals the fourth digit when represented as a string. Finally, it prints the count. The function does not handle any input validation or error handling, so it assumes valid input is provided.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
