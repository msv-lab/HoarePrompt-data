The variable `l` is assigned the value of `a.split()`, which splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The value of `a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid, so after execution, `l` will be a list of three elements (assuming the input is properly formatted). The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the split elements of that grid.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a 3x3 grid of lowercase English letters; `l` is a list containing the split elements of that grid.**
