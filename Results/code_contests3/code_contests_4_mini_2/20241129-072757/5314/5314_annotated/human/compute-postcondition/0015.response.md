The function `func` accepts two positive integers, `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)) and `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^6\)), along with a list `a` of `n` integers (where each integer \(a_i\) represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day and satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 86400\)). The function processes these inputs to calculate how many days it takes for `t` to become non-positive by decrementing `t` with the available time on each day (which is \(86400 - a[i]\)). It counts the number of days until `t` is less than or equal to zero and prints this count.

The functionality does not explicitly handle cases where `t` could initially be non-positive or if `n` or `a` is not appropriately defined, but as per the provided constraints, these cases are assumed to be valid based on the input conditions. Thus, the function assumes that the input will always meet the specified constraints.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of `n` integers representing time spent on work. It calculates how many days it takes for `t` to be reduced to zero or less by subtracting the available time for each day and prints the number of days counted. **
