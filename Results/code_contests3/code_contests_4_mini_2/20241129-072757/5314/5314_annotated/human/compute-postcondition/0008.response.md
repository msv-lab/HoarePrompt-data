The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. Other variables, `n` and `t`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
