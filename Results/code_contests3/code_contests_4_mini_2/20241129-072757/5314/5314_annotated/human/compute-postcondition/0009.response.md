According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[i])`, and `i` is increased by 1. The exact value of `t` after the last iteration isn't provided, but it is implied that it must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is adjusted accordingly.

Since `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[i])`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `t` must be greater than `86400 - int(a[i])`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[i])` and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than `86400 - int(a[i])`**
