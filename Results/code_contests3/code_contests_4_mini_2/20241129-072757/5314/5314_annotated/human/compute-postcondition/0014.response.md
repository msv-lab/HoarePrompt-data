The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `t`, and `a`. Here, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, indicating the number of days. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, representing a time constraint. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `ai` represents the time Luba has to spend on work during the i-th day, satisfying the condition 0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400.

The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the given conditions. The specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400), and processes these inputs to produce a result based on the specified conditions.**
