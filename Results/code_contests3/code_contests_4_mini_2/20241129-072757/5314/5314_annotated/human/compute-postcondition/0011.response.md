The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variable `n` remains unchanged, and `t` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `i` is increased by 1**
