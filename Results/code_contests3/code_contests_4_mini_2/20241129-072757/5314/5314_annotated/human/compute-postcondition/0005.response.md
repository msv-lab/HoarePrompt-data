The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is reduced by `86400 - int(a[0])`; `a` is a list of strings from the input; `i` is 1**
