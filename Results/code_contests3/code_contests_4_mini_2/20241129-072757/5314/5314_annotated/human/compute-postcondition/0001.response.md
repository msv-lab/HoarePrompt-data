The code `a = raw_input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns that list to the variable `a`. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of integers based on the input. However, we haven't processed the input into integers yet; they are still strings.

Since the initial state does not provide a specific input for `a`, the output state will reflect the update to `a` without making assumptions about its contents. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings from the input.**
