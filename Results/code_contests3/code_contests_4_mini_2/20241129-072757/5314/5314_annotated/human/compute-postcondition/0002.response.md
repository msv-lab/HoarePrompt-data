The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings from the input; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings from the input; `i` is 0.**
