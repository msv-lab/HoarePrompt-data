According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^6, which means `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for `t` as it already satisfies the condition. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings from the input; `i` is 0**
