The provided program aims to determine the minimum number of days it takes for Luba to finish reading a book based on the time available to her each day after completing her work. The problem description outlines this requirement clearly.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the values of `n` (number of days) and `t` (time required to read the book). It then reads a list `a` which contains the time spent on work each day.

2. **Time Calculation**: The program enters a loop where it continuously subtracts the available reading time from `t`. The available reading time for each day `i` is calculated as `86400 - a[i]`, which correctly reflects the total seconds in a day minus the seconds spent working.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until `t` becomes zero or negative, which is the condition needed to determine when Luba can finish the book. The program increments `i` in each iteration to track how many days have passed.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `i`, which represents the minimum day Luba can finish reading the book.

Now, let's examine if the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases:

- The loop structure ensures that it will iterate over all `n` days and correctly determine when Luba finishes reading based on her available time.
- The logic that subtracts the available reading time from `t` and checks for non-positivity is correct. It ensures that the program will eventually stop either when `t` is reduced to zero or when all days have been processed (as guaranteed by the problem statement).
- The implementation respects the constraints of the input values and ensures that the output is the minimum day required, which aligns with the problem description.

However, there is an issue with the use of `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3 (it should be `input()`). This could lead to a runtime error if the program is executed in a Python 3 environment. But since the problem does not specify the version of Python and assuming we focus on functionality, we can consider that the logic itself is correct.

Thus, despite the potential issue in the input function, the core logic of the program adheres to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
