Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 100) and `t` (between 1 and 10^6), and a list `a` containing `n` integers (each between 0 and 86400). It processes the elements of `a` in a loop, subtracting the difference between 86400 and each element from `t` until `t` is no longer positive or all elements of `a` have been processed. It then prints the number of elements processed, which can be at most `n`. If `t` is not sufficient to process all elements, the function will print the number of elements processed until `t` becomes non-positive. The function does not return any value. **
