The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, and it does not affect the other variables. The variable `t` is still subject to the condition that it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`; variable `i` is increased by 1.**
