To determine the output state after executing the given code, we analyze the impact of the statement `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`.

1. The variable `t` is decremented by the value `86400 - int(a[i])`.
2. The variable `a` holds a list of strings obtained from the input, and we are specifically interested in the integer value of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1).
3. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `ai` is a list of integers where each element can be between 0 and 86400, we have to consider the values of `t` and `int(a[i])`.

Assuming the value of `int(a[i])` can be determined from the input, the new value of `t` will be `t - (86400 - int(a[i]))`, which simplifies to `t - 86400 + int(a[i])`.

Given that `t` starts as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6` and `int(a[i])` (which corresponds to `a[1]`) is between 0 and 86400, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is now decremented by `86400 - int(a[1])`; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400); `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split(); `i` is 1.**
