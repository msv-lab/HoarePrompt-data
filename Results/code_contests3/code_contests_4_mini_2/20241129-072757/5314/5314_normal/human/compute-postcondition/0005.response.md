The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `ai`, `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400); `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split(); `i` is 1; `t` is decreased by (86400 - int(a[0])).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400); `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split(); `i` is 1; `t` is decreased by (86400 - int(a[0]))**
