The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` will be 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `ai`, and `a`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is now decremented by `86400 - int(a[1])`; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400); `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split(); `i` is 2.**
