Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that `t` is decreased by the sum of all (86400 - int(a[j])) for j from 0 to `i-1`; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400); `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split(); `i` is equal to the minimum of `n` and the number of iterations completed, which indicates how many elements were processed from the list `a`; `i` is printed.**
