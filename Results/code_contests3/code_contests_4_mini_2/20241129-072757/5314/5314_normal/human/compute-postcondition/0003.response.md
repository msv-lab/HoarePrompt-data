According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6. Since `t` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 1 (as per the given range), the loop can execute at least once. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each `ai` (0 ≤ `ai` ≤ 86400); `a` is a list of strings obtained from `raw_input().split(); `i` is 0**
