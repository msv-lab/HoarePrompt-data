The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `ai`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, indicating the number of elements in the list `ai`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6. The parameter `ai` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `ai` satisfies 0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400, representing time in seconds. After executing the function body, the return value is not specified in the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list of integers `ai`, but the exact output behavior is not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (an integer between 1 and 10^6), and ai (a list of n integers where each integer is between 0 and 86400). The return value is not specified.**
