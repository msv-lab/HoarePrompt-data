The variables `n` and `t` are assigned the values from the input, which is processed by `raw_input()` (or `input()` in Python 3) and converted into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n` and `t` can be any integers within their respective constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6). Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `t` will now hold values based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6**
