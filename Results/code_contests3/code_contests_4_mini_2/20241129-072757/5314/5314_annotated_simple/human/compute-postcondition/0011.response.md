The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `a`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is now less than its previous value by `86400 - int(a[2])`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is now less than its previous value by `86400 - int(a[2])`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `i` is 3**.
