The value of `t` is decremented by `86400 - int(a[i])`. The variable `i` is currently 2, so we need to look at the value of `a[2]`, convert it to an integer using `int(a[i])`, and then calculate the expression. The value of `t` decreases by the difference between `86400` and the integer value of `a[2]`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is now less than its previous value by `86400 - int(a[2])`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `t` is now less than its previous value by `86400 - int(a[2])`, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `i` is 2**
