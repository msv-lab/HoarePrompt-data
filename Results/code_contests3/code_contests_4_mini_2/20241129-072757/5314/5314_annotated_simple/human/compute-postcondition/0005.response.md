The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 0 to 1. The values of `n`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged in this step. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `i` is 1; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[0])`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `i` is 1; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[0])**
