To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to evaluate the impact of the operation on the variable `t`. 

1. The current value of `t` is reduced by the expression `86400 - int(a[i])`.
2. `a[i]` refers to the i-th element of the list `a`, which is a string that will be converted to an integer using `int()`.
3. The value of `i` is currently 1, thus `a[i]` corresponds to `a[1]`.
4. The new value of `t` will be calculated as follows: `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[1])`.

Since the previous state of `t` is not provided, we'll refer to it as `t` and the value of `int(a[1])` is also unknown but will be used directly in calculations.

The output state will reflect the adjustment made to `t` and will specify that `t` has been decreased. 

Thus, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[1])`; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `i` is 1.**
