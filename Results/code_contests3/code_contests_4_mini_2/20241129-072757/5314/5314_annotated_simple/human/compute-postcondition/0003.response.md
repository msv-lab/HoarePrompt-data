According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, which guarantees that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute one time without any adjustments needed. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6, `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace, `i` is 0**
