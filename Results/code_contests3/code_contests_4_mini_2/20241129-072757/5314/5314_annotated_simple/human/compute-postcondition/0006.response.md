According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6 and has been decreased by `86400 - int(a[0])`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain greater than 0 after this adjustment. 

Since `t` is decreased by `86400 - int(a[0])`, we need to ensure that the value of `t` before the decrease was at least `86400 - int(a[0]) + 1`, which ensures that after the decrease, `t` will still be greater than 0. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `t` is adjusted accordingly. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `i` is 1; for the loop to execute again `t` must be at least `86400 - int(a[0]) + 1`**
