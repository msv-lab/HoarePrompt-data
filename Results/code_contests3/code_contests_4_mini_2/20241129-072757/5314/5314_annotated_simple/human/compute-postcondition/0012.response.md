Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^6 minus the sum of `86400 - int(a[0]), 86400 - int(a[1]), ..., 86400 - int(a[i-1])`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations executed (which is the minimum of the length of `a` and the maximum number of times the loop can execute before `t` becomes non-positive). If `t` reached 0 or less, the loop terminated; otherwise, `i` is equal to the length of `a` if all elements were processed.**
