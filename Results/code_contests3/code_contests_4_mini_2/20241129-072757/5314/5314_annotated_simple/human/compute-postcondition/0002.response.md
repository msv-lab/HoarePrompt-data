The variable `i` is initialized to 0, but the values of `n`, `t`, and `a` are not affected by this assignment. The output state reflects that `i` has been set to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input split by whitespace; `i` is 0**
