The function accepts no parameters directly but reads two integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^6), from input, followed by a list of integers representing daily values `ai` (0 ≤ ai ≤ 86400) for each day. It calculates how many days can be processed before the total available time `t` becomes non-positive, deducting `86400 - ai` from `t` for each day processed. The function returns the count of days that can be processed before `t` is exhausted. If `t` reaches 0 or less, the loop stops, and `i` represents the number of days processed. If all days are processed and `t` is still positive, `i` will equal `n`.
