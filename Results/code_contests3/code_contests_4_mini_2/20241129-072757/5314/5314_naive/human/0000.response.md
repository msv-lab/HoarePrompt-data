Correctness: **False**.

The program contains a logic error in the way it calculates the remaining time Luba has to read each day. Specifically, the code uses `t -= 86400 - int(a[i])`, which implies that it is subtracting the total available reading time in a day (i.e., seconds in a day minus the working seconds). However, if Luba has no time left to read (i.e., if `a[i]` is equal to `86400`), the program will not correctly handle the case where she finishes reading on that day.

For example, consider the input:

```
2 86400
86400 0
```

Here, Luba needs exactly `86400` seconds to read the book, and on the first day, she works for `86400` seconds, leaving her with `0` seconds to read. The program would return `1`, indicating that she finishes reading on the first day, which is incorrect because she cannot read at all on that day.

Thus, there is a potential case where the program does not work as expected.
