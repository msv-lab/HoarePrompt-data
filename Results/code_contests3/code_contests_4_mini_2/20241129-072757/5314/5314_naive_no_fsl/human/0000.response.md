To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements step by step.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The first line reads two integers `n` (number of days) and `t` (time required to read the book).
   - The second line reads `n` integers representing the time Luba has to work each day.

2. **Logic of the While Loop**:
   - The program enters a while loop that continues until Luba has finished reading the book (`t > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the free time Luba has for reading by subtracting her working time from the total seconds in a day (86400).
   - It decreases `t` by the free time available for reading on that day.
   - The index `i` is incremented to move to the next day.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of days it took for Luba to finish reading the book.

### Important Edge Cases:
- **Case when Luba finishes reading on the last day**:
   - If `t` is exactly equal to the available reading time on the last day, the program should correctly return `n`.

- **Case when Luba does not have enough reading time**:
   - If the total available reading time over `n` days is less than `t`, the program should ideally indicate that it's not possible to finish the book, but the constraints guarantee that the answer does not exceed `n`.

### Potential Failure Case:
Let's consider an edge case:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  3 1000000
  0 0 0
  ```
  - Here, Luba has 0 seconds available for reading each day. Since `t` is 1000000 seconds, she will never finish reading the book, but the while loop will continue to increment `i` until it goes out of bounds (potentially leading to an index error) or just return `4` after the loop.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case properly when Luba doesnâ€™t have enough time to read (resulting in an incorrect output or potential errors), it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
