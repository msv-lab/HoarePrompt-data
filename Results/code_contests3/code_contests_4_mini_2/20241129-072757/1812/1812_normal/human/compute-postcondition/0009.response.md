Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'), `N` is an integer value derived from the string `S` excluding the last character, `C` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 depending on the last character of `S`, and `M` is calculated as `N - 1 & 3`. If `M` is in (1, 2), then `M` is updated to either 0 or 1 after the operation `M ^= 3`, and `N` is increased by the new value of `M`, resulting in `N` being updated accordingly.***
