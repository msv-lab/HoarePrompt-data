Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input consisting of a positive integer representing the row index (n) and a character representing the seat (s). It calculates and prints a specific value based on the adjusted row index and seat character, but it does not return any value. The function does not handle any potential input errors or edge cases, such as invalid characters for the seat or inputs that do not match the expected format. **
