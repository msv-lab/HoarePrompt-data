The value of `N` is incremented by `M`. The value of `M` can either be 1 or 2, and it will change to the opposite value. Therefore, after executing `N += M`, if `M` was 1, `N` will be `N + 1`, and if `M` was 2, `N` will be `N + 2`. The output state will reflect the possible new states of `N` based on the value of `M` before the operation. 

Output State: **`N` is either N - 1 + 1 or N - 2 + 2 depending on the previous value of `M`; `M` is changed to either 2 or 1 depending on its previous value.**
