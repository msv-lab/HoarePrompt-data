Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `s` is a character ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'), `S` is the string input, `N` is an integer obtained from `S` excluding the last character, and `C` is ord(S[-1]) - ord('a'). If `M` is in (1, 2), then `N` is updated to either N - 1 + 1 or N - 2 + 2 depending on the previous value of `M`, and `M` is changed to either 2 or 1 based on its previous value. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
