Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input comprising a positive integer representing the row number (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and a character representing the seat (either 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'). It processes this input to compute and print a value based on the row number and seat character, which includes adjustments to the row number if certain conditions are met. The function does not explicitly return a value but directly prints the computed result. **
