The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the row number, constrained between 1 and 10^18. The parameter `s` is a character that represents the seat in that row and can be one of the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f'. The function returns a value based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the row number and a character `s` representing the seat in that row. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the combination of the row number and the seat character.**
