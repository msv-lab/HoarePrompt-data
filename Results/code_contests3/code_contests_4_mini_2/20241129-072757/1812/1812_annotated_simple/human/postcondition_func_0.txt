The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) representing the row index and a character `s` ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', or 'f') representing the seat in that row. It calculates and prints a value based on the adjusted row index and seat character. Specifically, if the modulo of `n-1` with 4 is 1 or 2, `n` is adjusted, and the final output formula computes a specific result based on the modified `n` and the seat character. Note that the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
