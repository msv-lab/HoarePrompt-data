The operation `M ^= 3` modifies the value of `M` using the bitwise XOR operation with 3. The value of `M` can either be 1 or 2.

- If `M` is 1:
  - In binary, `1` is `01`, and `3` is `11`.
  - Performing XOR: `01 XOR 11` results in `10` (which is 2 in decimal).
- If `M` is 2:
  - In binary, `2` is `10`, and `3` is `11`.
  - Performing XOR: `10 XOR 11` results in `01` (which is 1 in decimal).

Therefore, the value of `M` becomes either 2 or 1 depending on its initial value.

Since the states of `n` and `s` are not affected by this operation, the output state will reflect the possible new values of `M`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `s` is the input string; `M` is either 1 or 2 (M is now either 2 or 1).**
