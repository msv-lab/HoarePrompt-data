The value of `N` is incremented by `M`. Since `M` is either 1 or 2, `N` will be incremented by either 1 or 2, but the previous value of `N` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `N` is either increased by 1 or 2 depending on the value of `M`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18); `N` is either increased by 1 or 2 depending on the value of `M`**
