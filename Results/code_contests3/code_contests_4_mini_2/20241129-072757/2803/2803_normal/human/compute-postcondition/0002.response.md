The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details about the return value or behavior of the function, it is not possible to describe its functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraints that n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is unspecified.**
