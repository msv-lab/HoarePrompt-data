The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided through `raw_input()`, which accepts a string that is then split into two parts and converted into integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within the bounds of 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18, the values of `n` and `k` can be changed based on the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `k` are now assigned new integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new integer values based on input within the bounds 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
