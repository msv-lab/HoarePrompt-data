Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, through user input. It returns `n` if `k` is equal to 1; otherwise, it calculates and returns \(2^{\text{len}(\text{bin}(n)[2:])} - 1\), which represents the maximum value that can be represented with the number of bits required to represent `n`, minus one. The function does not handle cases where `k` is outside the specified constraints, and it does not return any value explicitly; it only prints the result.**
