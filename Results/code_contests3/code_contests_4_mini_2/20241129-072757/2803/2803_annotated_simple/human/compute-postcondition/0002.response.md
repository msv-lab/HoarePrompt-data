The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as there are no parameters defined in the function signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18} \). 

Since the function's output is not provided in the prompt, we cannot ascertain the specific behavior or return values of the function based solely on the constraints. Therefore, we can conclude that the functionality of the function cannot be detailed without further information on its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and is constrained by the conditions that n and k are positive integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
