Since the input is taken from `raw_input()`, which is expected to provide two space-separated positive integers, `n` and `k` are assigned values based on this input. The conditions state that `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, meaning that `n` and `k` will be positive integers satisfying these conditions.

However, since we do not know the specific input values provided during the execution, we cannot determine the exact values for `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the output state should reflect that `n` and `k` are now both positive integers, but we cannot specify their exact values.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
