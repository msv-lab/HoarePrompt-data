The function `func` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input, where the constraints are that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). It computes and prints a result based on the value of `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than 1, it calculates \(2^{\text{len(bin(n)[2:])}} - 1\), which effectively gives the maximum value of a number with the same number of bits as `n` minus one. If `k` equals 1, the function simply returns `n`. 

The functionality of the function does not directly accept parameters, and it is important to note that it relies on the user providing valid inputs from standard input. The function does not handle any potential errors or edge cases related to invalid inputs, as it assumes that the input will always conform to the specified constraints.

Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k`, and prints \(2^{\text{len(bin(n)[2:])}} - 1\) if \(k > 1\); otherwise, it prints `n`. It does not handle invalid input or edge cases beyond the specified constraints. **
