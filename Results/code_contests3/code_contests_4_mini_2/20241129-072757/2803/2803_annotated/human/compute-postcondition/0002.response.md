The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers with the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Without specific output details provided, I cannot describe the return values or cases. Therefore, based on the available information, I can only note the parameter constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. It does not accept parameters directly.**
