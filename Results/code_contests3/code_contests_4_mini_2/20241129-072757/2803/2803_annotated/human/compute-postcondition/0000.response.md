In this case, `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The code snippet takes input values for `n` and `k` using `raw_input()` and converts them to integers.

Since `raw_input()` is used, the values of `n` and `k` will be assigned based on the user input. However, without specific values being provided through input, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of these variables based on the input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned integer values based on user input, with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^18.**
