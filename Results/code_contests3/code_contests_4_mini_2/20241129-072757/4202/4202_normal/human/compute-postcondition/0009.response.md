According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input received from `raw_input()`. The loop will iterate over the characters in the input string. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, the input string must not be empty. 

Given that:
- `pa` represents the count of '1's in the input string, which is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
- `i` is assigned the last character of the input string, which will only be valid if the input string is non-empty.
- `pb` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- The input string must have at least one character.
- `i` should be the first character of the input string.

Thus, the adjusted state before the loop starts should reflect that the input string is non-empty.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1', `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `i` is the first character of the input string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input string is not empty.**
