In the provided code, `pb` is updated based on the condition `i == '1'`. If `i` is equal to '1', then `pb` is incremented by 1. If `i` is '0', then `pb` remains unchanged. The initial values of `a` and `b` are not directly relevant to this operation.

Given that `pb` was previously defined as 1 if `i` is '1', or 0 otherwise, the possible outcomes for `pb` will be determined by the value of `i`.

- If `i` is '1', then `pb` will become `pb + 1`.
- If `i` is '0', then `pb` will remain the same.

Since `i` is specified as the next character in the input string, the exact value of `pb` after executing the line of code depends on the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pb` is either 2 if `i` is '1' or remains the same if `i` is '0'; `i` is the next character in the input string.**
