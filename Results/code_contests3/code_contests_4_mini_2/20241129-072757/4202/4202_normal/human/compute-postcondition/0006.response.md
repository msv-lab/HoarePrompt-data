The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `i` is the third character of the input string, which is either '0' or '1'. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pa` will increase by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `pa` is either 0 or 1, the output state depends on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1 or 2 (if it started as 1).
If `i` is '0', then `pa` remains 0 or 1.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is either 0 or 1; `i` is either '0' or '1', and `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.**
