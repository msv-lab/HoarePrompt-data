To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, we must consider the components involved in the for loop. The loop iterates over the result of `raw_input()`, which will provide a string of characters.

1. The loop will execute if there is a non-empty string provided by `raw_input()`.
2. The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in the string provided by `raw_input()`.

Given the state before the loop starts (`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is 0), we need to ensure that `raw_input()` returns a string that is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute:

- `raw_input()` should return a non-empty string (which can be any combination of '0' and '1').
- The variable `i` will be initialized to the first character of that input string.

Thus, we conclude that for the loop to execute, we also need to define the value of `i`.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1', `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of that string**.
