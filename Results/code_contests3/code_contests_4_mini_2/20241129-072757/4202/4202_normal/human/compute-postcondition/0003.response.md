According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string returned by `raw_input()`. Given that `i` is the first character of this string, for the loop to execute a second time, there must be at least one more character in the string following the initial character. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the non-empty string returned by `raw_input()`, and `pa` is determined by whether `i` is '1'. Since the loop iterates over each character in the string, if `i` is the first character, then for the loop to execute again, the string must have at least 2 characters, and `i` will then become the second character in the string.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '1' or not; for the loop to execute a second time, the string returned by raw_input() must have at least 2 characters, and `i` will be the second character of that string.**
