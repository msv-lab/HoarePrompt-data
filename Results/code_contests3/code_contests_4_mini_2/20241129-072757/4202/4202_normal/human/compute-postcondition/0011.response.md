According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the input provided to `raw_input()`. The loop will read a new character from the input each time it executes. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the input string. Since we are processing a string character by character, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to have another character available in the input string. 

Assuming the input string has at least one more character, after reading the current character `i`, `i` will be updated to the next character in the string, and `pb` will be set depending on the value of the new `i`.

Thus, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `pa` and `pb` remain unchanged, but `i` will be updated to the next character in the string, and we will need to ensure there is at least one more character available in the input string.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `i` is the next character in the input string; `pb` is 1 if `i` is '1', otherwise `pb` remains 0, for the loop to execute again there must be at least one more character in the input string.**
