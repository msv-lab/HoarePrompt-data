The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The value of `i` is determined from the second character of the input string, which must have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute a second time. Since `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '1' or not, the new value of `pa` will be either 0 or 1 more than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is either 0 or 1; `i` is the second character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is either 0 or 1; `i` is the second character of the input string.**
