According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters of the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. The variable `i` is set to the second character of the input string at the end of the last iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the input string must have at least 3 characters (to provide a third character for the next iteration), and `i` will be updated to the third character in the string.

State: **`a` and `b` are strings consisting only of '0' and '1'; `pa` is either 0 or 1; `i` is the third character of the input string, for the loop to execute a second time the input string must have at least 3 characters.**
