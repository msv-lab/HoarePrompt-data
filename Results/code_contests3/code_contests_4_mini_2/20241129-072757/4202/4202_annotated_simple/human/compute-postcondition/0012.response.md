The variable `pb` is incremented by 1 if the condition `i == '1'` is true. Since `i` is defined as the second character of the input string, its value can either be '1' or '0'. The value of `pb` can either be 0 or 1 prior to this operation. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` will increase by 1 (making it either 1 or 2), and if `i` is '0', `pb` remains unchanged.

Thus, the output state will reflect the possible changes to `pb` based on the value of `i`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string, `pb` is either 0 or 1 or 2 depending on `i`, `i` is the second character of the input string.**
