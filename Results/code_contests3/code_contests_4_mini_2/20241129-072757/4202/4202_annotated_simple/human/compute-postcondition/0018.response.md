Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-empty binary strings, counts the number of '1's in each string, and prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, the function does not take parameters directly and instead reads two strings from standard input. **
