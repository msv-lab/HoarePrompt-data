The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'. Since `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '1', we can determine the possible values for `pa`. If `i` is '1', then `pa` becomes 1 or 2; if `i` is '0', then `pa` remains the same. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `pa` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', or remains the same if `i` is '0'; `i` is the second character of the input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `pa` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', or remains the same if `i` is '0'; `i` is the second character of the input.**
