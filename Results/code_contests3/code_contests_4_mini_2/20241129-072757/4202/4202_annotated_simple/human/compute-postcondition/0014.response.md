The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The previous value of `pb` can be either 0, 1, or 2, depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is '1', `pb` is increased by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `pb` is either 0, 1, or 2 (incremented if `i` is '1'), and `i` is the third character of the input string.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in `a`, `pb` is either 0, 1, or 2 (incremented if `i` is '1'), and `i` is the third character of the input string.**
