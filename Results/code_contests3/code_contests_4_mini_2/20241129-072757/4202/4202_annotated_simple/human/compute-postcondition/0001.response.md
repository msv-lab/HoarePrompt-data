According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the input provided during the `raw_input()`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string returned by `raw_input()`. 

Since `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1", it is important to note that the loop's execution is not directly influenced by `a` and `b`, but rather by the input from `raw_input()`. 

For the loop to execute, `raw_input()` must return a non-empty string. Therefore, we can assume that the loop will execute at least once if `raw_input()` returns a valid non-empty string.

At the end of the last iteration, `pa` is still 0 since it does not change in the loop body, which is omitted. The loop variable `i` will be set to the first character of the input from `raw_input()`.

State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1", `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `raw_input()` returns a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of that input.**
