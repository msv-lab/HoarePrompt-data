`pb` is assigned the value `0`, but the values of the other variables `a`, `b`, `pa`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `i` is the last character of the input string; `pb` is 0.
