According to the code, the loop executes for each character in the input received from `raw_input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the input string. Given that `a` and `b` are non-empty strings, it implies that the input will have more characters beyond the first one, allowing the loop to iterate again. 

Since `i` will take the next character in the input for the next iteration, `i` must be updated to the second character of the input, and `pa` must be determined based on whether the new `i` is '1' or not.

Thus, if the input string has a length greater than 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be the second character of the input, and `pa` will be set based on this new `i`.

State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1", `pa` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i` is '1'; `i` is the second character of the input.**
