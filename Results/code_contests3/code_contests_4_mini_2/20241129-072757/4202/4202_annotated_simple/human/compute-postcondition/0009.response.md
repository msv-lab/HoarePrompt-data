According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by `raw_input()`. The `for` loop will iterate over each character in the input string. For the loop to execute at least once, the input string must not be empty. The current states are `a` and `b` being non-empty strings, `pa` being the count of '1's in the input string, `i` being the last character of the input string, and `pb` being 0. However, the variable `i` in the context of the loop will be reassigned to each character of the input string during the iterations.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure the input string from `raw_input()` is non-empty. Therefore, the `i` variable will be set to the first character of the input string.

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string, `pb` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input string from raw_input() is non-empty and `i` is the first character of that input string.**
