The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if the first character `i` of the input string is equal to '1'. The initial state specifies that `pb` is 0. Therefore, if `i` is '1', `pb` becomes 1; otherwise, it remains 0. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a non-empty string, `pa` is the count of '1's in a non-empty string, `pb` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the first character of the input string.**
