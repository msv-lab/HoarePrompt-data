The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only the characters "0" and "1", with lengths between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The function performs operations based on these two binary strings and returns a result based on the specific logic applied to them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-empty binary string parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a result based on operations performed on these binary strings.**
