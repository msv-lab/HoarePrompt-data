The value of `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1', otherwise, it remains unchanged. The value of `i` is the third character of the input string. Since `pa` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', the final value of `pa` could be either 2 or 3. If `i` is '0', `pa` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `i` is the third character of the input; `pa` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `i` is the third character of the input; `pa` is either 1 or 2 if `i` is '1', otherwise it remains unchanged.**
