The variable `pa` is initialized to `0`. The initial state of `a` and `b` as non-empty strings containing only the characters "0" and "1" is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `pa` is 0.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing only "0" and "1"; `pa` is 0**
