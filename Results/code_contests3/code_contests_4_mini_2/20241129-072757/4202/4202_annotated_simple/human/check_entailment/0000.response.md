Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality required by the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read the input strings `a` and `b`. However, it does not store these inputs in any variables. Instead, it counts the number of '1's in the first input string and assigns it to `pa`, and then counts the number of '1's in the second input string and assigns it to `pb`. The problem description requires that it checks if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` using the specified operations, but the current implementation only compares the counts of '1's in both strings.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses the condition `pa >= pb` to print "YES" or "NO". This logic is flawed because simply having an equal or greater count of '1's in `a` compared to `b` does not guarantee that `a` can be transformed into `b`. The problem requires consideration of the parity of the strings and the ability to manipulate the strings with the operations defined (writing parity and removing the first character).

3. **Missing Operations**: The operations defined in the problem (writing the parity to the end of `a` and removing the first character) are not implemented in the program. The program should simulate these operations and check if `a` can indeed become `b`.

In summary, the program fails to follow the problem description because it does not consider the actual transformation process required to determine if `a` can be turned into `b`, and it uses an incorrect method of comparison based solely on the counts of '1's, disregarding the required operations.
