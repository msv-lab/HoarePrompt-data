You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are fishing with polar bears Alice and Bob. While waiting for the fish to bite, the polar bears get bored. They come up with a game. First Alice and Bob each writes a 01-string (strings that only contain character "0" and "1") a and b. Then you try to turn a into b using two types of operations:

  * Write parity(a) to the end of a. For example, <image>. 
  * Remove the first character of a. For example, <image>. You cannot perform this operation if a is empty. 



You can use as many operations as you want. The problem is, is it possible to turn a into b?

The parity of a 01-string is 1 if there is an odd number of "1"s in the string, and 0 otherwise.

Input

The first line contains the string a and the second line contains the string b (1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 1000). Both strings contain only the characters "0" and "1". Here |x| denotes the length of the string x.

Output

Print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to turn a into b, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

Examples

Input

01011
0110


Output

YES


Input

0011
1110


Output

NO

Note

In the first sample, the steps are as follows: 01011 → 1011 → 011 → 0110
Program:
```
pa = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pa += i == '1'
pb = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pb += i == '1'
print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
