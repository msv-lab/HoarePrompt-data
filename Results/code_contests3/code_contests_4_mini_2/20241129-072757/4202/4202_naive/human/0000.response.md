To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and how it relates to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
We are given two binary strings `a` and `b`. The goal is to determine if we can transform `a` into `b` using two operations:
1. Append the parity of string `a` (0 or 1) to the end of `a`.
2. Remove the first character of `a` (this operation cannot be performed if `a` is empty).

The parity of a string is defined as:
- Parity is `1` if there is an odd number of `1`s in the string.
- Parity is `0` if there is an even number of `1`s in the string.

### Program Analysis
Here's the provided program:
```python
pa = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pa += i == '1'
pb = 0
for i in raw_input():
    pb += i == '1'
print['NO', 'YES'][pa >= pb]
```

#### Breakdown:
1. The program counts the number of `1`s in the string `a` and stores it in `pa`.
2. It counts the number of `1`s in the string `b` and stores it in `pb`.
3. It prints "YES" if `pa` (number of `1`s in `a`) is greater than or equal to `pb` (number of `1`s in `b`), otherwise it prints "NO".

#### Issues:
1. The program only considers the count of `1`s in both strings and doesn't account for the actual string transformation process as defined in the problem statement.
2. The program ignores the operations of removing characters and appending parities, which are crucial for the transformation from `a` to `b`.
3. There are cases where `pa >= pb` may still not allow transforming `a` into `b`. For instance, if `a` is `011` and `b` is `110`, even though `pa` is not less than `pb`, it is impossible to transform `a` into `b` using the allowed operations.

### Example Counter Case
- Consider `a = "01"` and `b = "10"`. 
  - `pa` would be `1` (one `1` in `01`).
  - `pb` would be `1` (one `1` in `10`).
  - The program would output "YES" because `pa >= pb`, but it is impossible to transform `01` into `10` using the allowed operations.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to transform `a` into `b` based on the allowed operations outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **False**.
