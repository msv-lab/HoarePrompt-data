The function reads two binary strings from the input, counts the number of '1's in each string, and compares these counts. It prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in the first string is greater than or equal to the count in the second string, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not take any parameters but expects input from the user directly.
