The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is equal to '1'. The current value of `i` is the second character of the input string, which can either be '0' or '1'. Therefore, `pb` will be updated based on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is '1', then `pb` will increase by 1; if `i` is '0', then `pb` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `pa`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a string containing "0" and "1", `b` is a string containing "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is updated based on the value of `i`, and `i` is the second character of the input string.**
