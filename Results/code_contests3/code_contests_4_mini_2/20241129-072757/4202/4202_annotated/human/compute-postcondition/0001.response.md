According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input provided by `raw_input()`. For the loop to execute at least once, there must be at least one character in the input, which can be either "0" or "1". The variable `i` will take on the value of the first character from the input string. The values of `a`, `b`, and `pa` do not directly influence the loop execution in this case.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the input must not be empty. We can initialize `i` to the first character of the input string. 

State: **`a` is a string containing "0" and "1", `b` is a string containing "0" and "1", `pa` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time the input from raw_input() is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of that input**
