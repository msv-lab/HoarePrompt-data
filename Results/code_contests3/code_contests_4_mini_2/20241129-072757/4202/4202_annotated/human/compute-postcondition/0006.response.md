The value of `i` is used to check if it is equal to the string `'1'`. The variable `pa` is incremented by 1 (or remains the same if `i` is not `'1'`), based on the comparison result. Since the previous state indicates that `a`, `b`, and `i` are defined, but we don't have the specific values of `pa` or `i`, we cannot determine the exact values after this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `pa` due to the evaluation of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is a string containing "0" and "1", `b` is a string containing "0" and "1", `i` is the third character of the input string; `pa` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.**
