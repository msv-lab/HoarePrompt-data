The value of `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '1'. The variable `i` is the third character of the input string. Since `a` and `b` are strings containing "0" and "1", `i` can either be '0' or '1'. The previous value of `pb` is unknown, but it will increase by 1 if `i` is '1'. The output state reflects the values of the variables and the condition checked.

Output State: **`a` is a string containing "0" and "1"; `b` is a string containing "0" and "1"; `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string; `pb` is updated based on `i`; `i` is the third character of the input string; `pb` is incremented by 1 if `i` is '1'.**
