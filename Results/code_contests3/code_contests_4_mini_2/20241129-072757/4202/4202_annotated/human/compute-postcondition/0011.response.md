According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the input string obtained from `raw_input()`. The variable `i` holds the current character being processed. In order for the loop to execute again, there needs to be another character in the input string to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of the non-empty input string. The current state indicates that `a` and `b` are strings containing "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, and `pb` is 1 if `i` is '1' otherwise `pb` remains 0.

For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be updated to the second character of the string. Therefore, `i` will be the next character in the input string, and since the input string is non-empty and has at least one character, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a string containing "0" and "1", `b` is a string containing "0" and "1", `pa` is the count of '1's in the input string, `pb` is 1 if the next character is '1' otherwise `pb` remains 0, and `i` is the second character of the input string.**
