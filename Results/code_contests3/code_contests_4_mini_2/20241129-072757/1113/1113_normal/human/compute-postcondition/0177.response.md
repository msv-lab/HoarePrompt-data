According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it has at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, which means the loop has iterated through the characters in the string `row`. 

The next character in `row` that the loop will process depends on the length of `row`. Since `i` is currently 9, to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 10. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must have at least 11 characters.

Additionally, since `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value when `i` equals '9', after the next iteration, `nRow` will have its updated value.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 10, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the previous value appended with '1'**
