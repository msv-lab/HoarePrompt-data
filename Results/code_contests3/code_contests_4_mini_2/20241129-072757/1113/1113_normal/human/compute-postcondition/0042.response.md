The value of `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row` after '9'. Since `i` is a character, it needs to be converted to an integer to be added to `nRow`. The initial state indicates that `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list of length `nRow + 1`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the next character in `row`. However, without knowing the exact value of `i`, we cannot determine the new value of `nRow`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, which is unknown but will be an integer representation of the character `i`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 1`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is increased by the integer value of `i`.**
