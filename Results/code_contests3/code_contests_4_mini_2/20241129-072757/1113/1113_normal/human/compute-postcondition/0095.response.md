According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is non-empty, and `i` is the first character of `row` that is not equal to '9'. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is the first character of `row`.

Given that `i` is currently the first character of `row` that is not equal to '9', for the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to take on the next character in the string `row`. 

If `row` has more characters after the current character represented by `i`, then the loop will execute again. On the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `row`. 

State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `i` is the next character in `row`**
