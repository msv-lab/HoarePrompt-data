To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code. The loop iterates through each character in the string `row`. For each character `i`, if it is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`; otherwise, it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`. 

After all iterations of the loop have executed:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still between 1 and 10^4.
- The value of `res` remains an empty list as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `nRow` will be constructed from the characters of `row`, with every '9' replaced by '1' and every other character staying the same.

If `row` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `nRow` will remain an empty string. 

Thus, the final state of the variables is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `nRow` is a string formed from `row` with all '9's replaced by '1'.**
