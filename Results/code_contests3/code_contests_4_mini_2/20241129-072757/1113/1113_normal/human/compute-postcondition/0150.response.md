The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string '1'. However, the previous value of `nRow` is unknown as it is not defined in the initial state. The values of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is '9', and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**.
