According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. If `row` contains at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` is updated to include '1' as its new value if `row` has at least one character. If `row` does not have at least one character, `nRow` is increased by `i`, and again `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is '9' and `t` is between 1 and 10^4, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one more character, which is a requirement for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, for the loop to execute again `row` must contain at least one more character.**
