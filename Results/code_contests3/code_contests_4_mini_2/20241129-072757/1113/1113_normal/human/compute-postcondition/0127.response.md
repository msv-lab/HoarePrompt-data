The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `res`, `t`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` must be greater than 10^4 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 0, and `row` is the stripped input string.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` must be greater than 10^4 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 0, `row` is the stripped input string.**
