`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'. However, since the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, we cannot determine the new value of `nRow`. The other variables (`t`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `row` must have at least 10 characters for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is 10, and the value of `nRow` changes but is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` must have at least 10 characters for the loop to execute one more time, `i` is 10, and the value of `nRow` changes but is unknown.**
