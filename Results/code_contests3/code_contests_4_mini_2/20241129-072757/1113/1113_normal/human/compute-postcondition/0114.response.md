According to the code, the loop executes for each character in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which means it is pointing to the first character of the string. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in the `row` string.

Since `row` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute again for the next character. The current character in `row` being processed is the first character (when `i` is 0), and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment to 1, processing the second character in the `row` string.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `nRow` remains '0' if `i` is not '9' (which it is not), and `t` is still 10^4.

State: **`nRow` is '0', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 characters.**
