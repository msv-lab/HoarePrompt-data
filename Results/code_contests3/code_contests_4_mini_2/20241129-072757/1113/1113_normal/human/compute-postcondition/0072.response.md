The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, the initial state does not mention the previous value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine its exact outcome. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty of `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated but its previous value is unknown.**
