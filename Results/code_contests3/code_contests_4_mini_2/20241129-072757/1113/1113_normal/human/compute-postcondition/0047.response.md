The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will hold the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state does not provide any specific value for `row`, and it will be based on user input. Other variables such as `t`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains one additional element which is `nRow`, `i` must be 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains one additional element which is `nRow`, `i` must be 9, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
