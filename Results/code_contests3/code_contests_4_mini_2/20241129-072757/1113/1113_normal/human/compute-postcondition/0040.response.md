According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. Since `row` is non-empty, the loop can execute again for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` is incremented by '1', affecting its value.

To execute one more time, we need to consider the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop will continue to execute. If `i` was '9', then it will move to the next character in the `row` string which will be the character at the next index.

So, for the loop to execute a second time, we need to adjust `i` to the next character in `row`, and we need to consider the updated value of `nRow` which will be `nRow + 1` because `i` was '9'.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow + 1`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'**
