`nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'**
