According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters left to iterate over, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` is '1'. For the loop to execute again, the next character in `row` must be available.

Since `i` is the first character in `row`, the next iteration will use the next character. Assuming `row` has at least one more character, `i` will take that character, and if it is not '9', `nRow` will be adjusted accordingly based on the value of `i`.

If `row` has one more character after '9', `i` will take that character. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` will increase by the value of that character. If `i` is '9', `nRow` will remain '1'.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, for the loop to execute again, `row` must contain at least one more character, `nRow` will be updated based on the next character in `row`.**
