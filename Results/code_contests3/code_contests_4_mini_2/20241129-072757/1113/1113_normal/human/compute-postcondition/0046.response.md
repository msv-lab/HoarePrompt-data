According to the code, the loop will execute a total of 9 times, as it is defined to iterate through the range of 9. The variable `i` serves as the loop counter, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be 8 for the loop to execute a final time. 

Since `i` is currently 8, it can be incremented to 9 for a total of 9 iterations (0 to 8). After this iteration, `i` would be 9, and the loop would not execute again because the range only goes up to 8. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 9, and the loop will not run again as the range condition would not be satisfied. The state of `t` and `res` remains the same, as they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains one additional element which is `nRow`, for the loop to execute a final time `i` must be 9**
