`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, effectively appending the character '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The initial state mentions that `row` has at least 11 characters, but `nRow` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we can only say that `nRow` is updated by appending '1'. The values of `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` has at least 11 characters, `i` is 11, `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end.**
