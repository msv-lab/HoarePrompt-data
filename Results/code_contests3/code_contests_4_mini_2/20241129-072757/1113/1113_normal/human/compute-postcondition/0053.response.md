`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the first character of `row`, which is not '9', and `nRow` is an existing value. Since `i` is a character, it will be treated as its integer representation when added to `nRow`. The output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow` but does not change `t`, `res`, or `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` contains at least one character, and `nRow` is updated by adding the integer value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` contains at least one character, and `nRow` is updated by adding the integer value of `i`.**
