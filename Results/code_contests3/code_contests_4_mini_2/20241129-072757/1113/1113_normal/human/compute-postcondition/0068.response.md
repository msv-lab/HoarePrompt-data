The value of `row` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which will accept input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
