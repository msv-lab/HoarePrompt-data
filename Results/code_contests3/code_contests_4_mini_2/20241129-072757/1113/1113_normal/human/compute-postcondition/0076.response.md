According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 9, which means the loop has processed 9 characters from the `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `row`. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string, it must have at least 10 characters for `i` to be 9 and still allow for the next iteration. Therefore, on the next iteration, `i` will be updated to 10 (the next character in the `row`).

State: **`t` is 10^4, for the loop to execute one more time `row` must have at least 10 characters, `i` is 10**
