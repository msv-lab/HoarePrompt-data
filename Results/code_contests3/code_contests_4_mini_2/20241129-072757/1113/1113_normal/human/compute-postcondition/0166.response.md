The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. This operation does not alter the value of `row` or the contents of the list `res`. The values of `t`, `T`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string.**
