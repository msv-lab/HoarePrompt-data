The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not provided, and since `i` is 0, this means that `nRow` remains unchanged regardless of its initial value. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` is still based on its previous value. The other variables `t`, `row`, and the condition on `i` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` remains unchanged**
