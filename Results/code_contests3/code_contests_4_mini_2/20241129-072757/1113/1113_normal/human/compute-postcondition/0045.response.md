The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The values of `t` and the contents of `res` are not directly affected by this operation. However, since `res` is a list, its length will increase by one with the addition of `nRow`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` now contains one additional element which is `nRow`, and `nRow` is the modified version of `row`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` now contains one additional element which is `nRow`, and `nRow` is the modified version of `row`.**
