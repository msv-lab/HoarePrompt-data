According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` contains at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means `nRow` has been updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `row`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `row` must contain at least 2 characters, and `i` will be the next character in `row` after '9'. If there is no character after '9', the loop will not execute again. 

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `row` contains at least 2 characters, and `i` is the next character in `row` after '9'**
