The variable `maxint` is assigned the value of positive infinity using `float('inf')`. This does not affect any other variables, including `t`, which remains an integer within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity**.
