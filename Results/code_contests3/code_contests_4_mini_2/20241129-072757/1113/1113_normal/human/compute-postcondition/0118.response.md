According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the `row` string. At the end of the last iteration, `nRow` is '01', `t` is 10^4, and `row` contains at least 1 character. Since `i` is assigned to each character in `row`, after the last iteration, `i` will be the last character in `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take the next character in `row`. If `row` has more than one character, then `i` will be set to the second character on the next iteration. If `row` has exactly one character, the loop cannot execute again. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration, assuming `row` has more than one character. 

State: **`nRow` is '01', `t` is 10^4, `i` is the second character in `row` (assuming row has at least 2 characters)**.
