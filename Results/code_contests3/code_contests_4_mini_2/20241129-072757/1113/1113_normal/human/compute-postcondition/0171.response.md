`nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + i`. Given that `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is 8, the concatenation of an empty string with the string representation of `i` results in `nRow` becoming '8'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '8'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '8'**
