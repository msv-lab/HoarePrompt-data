The code `nRow += i` increments the value of `nRow` by `i`. However, we do not have the previous value of `nRow` or `i`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow`. The other variables (`t` and `res`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `nRow` is incremented by `i`**
