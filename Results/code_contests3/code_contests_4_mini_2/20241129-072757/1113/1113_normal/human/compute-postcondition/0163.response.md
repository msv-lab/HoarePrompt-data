The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the string `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state shows that `res` already contains 9 strings, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', while all other characters remain unchanged. This means the value of `nRow` is defined based on the contents of `row`.

After executing the code, the list `res` will now contain 10 strings. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `i`, `row`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the last character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.**
