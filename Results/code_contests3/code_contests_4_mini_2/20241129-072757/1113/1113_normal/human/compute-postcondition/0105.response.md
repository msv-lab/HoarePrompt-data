According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of 9 times, as specified by `range(9)`. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to 8 during the iterations. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, which is the last value before the loop terminates. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9, but since the range is limited to 9, the loop cannot run again.

Thus, the loop cannot execute a second time because `i` is already at its maximum value of 8.

State: **`nRow` is the original input string `row` with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'; `t` is 10^4; `row` is the original input string; `res` now includes `nRow`, but the loop cannot execute again as `i` is 9 and the range is 9.**
