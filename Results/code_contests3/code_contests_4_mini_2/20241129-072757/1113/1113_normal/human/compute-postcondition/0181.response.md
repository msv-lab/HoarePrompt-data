To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze how the loop processes the string `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`, checking if the character is '9'. If it is, '1' is appended to `nRow`; otherwise, the character itself is appended to `nRow`.

Given the initial state:
- `res` is a list containing 10 strings.
- `t` is \(10^5\).
- `T` is greater than \(10^4\).
- `i` starts as 8.
- `row` is a non-empty string.
- `nRow` is initially an empty string.

The loop continues until all characters in `row` have been processed. 

Assuming `row` is processed completely and contains a mix of '9's and other digits, `nRow` will be constructed by replacing every '9' with '1' while retaining the other characters as they are. 

If `row` contains `m` characters, and letâ€™s say `k` of those characters are '9', then after processing:
- `nRow` will have \(m - k\) characters from `row` that are not '9' plus \(k\) characters that are '1', resulting in a total length of `m`.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, the output state will be:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1'.**
