`nRow` is incremented by `i`. Since `nRow` is initially '0', it is treated as a string. Therefore, the operation concatenates '0' with `i` (which is 1), resulting in the string '01'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '01', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`nRow` is '01', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string, `i` is 1**
