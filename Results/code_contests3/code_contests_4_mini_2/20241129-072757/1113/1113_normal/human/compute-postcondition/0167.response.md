According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character.

Given the current states:
- `res` is a list containing 10 strings (which does not impact the loop execution).
- `t` is 10^5 (which also does not affect the loop execution).
- `T` is greater than 10^4 (not relevant for loop execution).
- `i` is 8 (this will be overwritten by the loop variable).
- `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
- `nRow` is an empty string (not relevant for loop execution).

For the loop to be executed at least once, `row` must not be an empty string. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `row` must contain at least one character.
- The loop variable `i` will be overwritten when the loop starts, so its initial value before the loop is not relevant.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must contain at least one character.**
