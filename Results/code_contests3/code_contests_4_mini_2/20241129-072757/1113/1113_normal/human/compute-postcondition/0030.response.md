According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. The current state indicates that `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is 9, but `i` will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the loop execution.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `row` is a non-empty string. Therefore, the adjusted states should indicate that `row` is a non-empty string, and when the loop starts, `i` will be set to the first character of `row`.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` will be the first character of `row`**
