The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string `'1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, but since it is being modified by appending a string, the output state will indicate that `nRow` is now updated to include an additional '1' at the end of its previous value. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `T`, `i`, `row`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the third character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `nRow` is updated to include an additional '1'.**
