The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '1', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`nRow` is '1', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string with at least 1 character, `i` is 0, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
