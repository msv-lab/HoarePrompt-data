To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can deduce the following from the provided loop code:

1. The loop iterates through each character in the string `row`.
2. For each character `i`, if `i` is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
3. If `i` is not '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

Given these rules, after the loop has executed for all characters in `row`, `nRow` will consist of:
- A string composed of '1' for each occurrence of '9' in `row`.
- All other characters from `row` will be included in their original form, except for '9'.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `row` contains the original input string, and `nRow` is the result string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.**
