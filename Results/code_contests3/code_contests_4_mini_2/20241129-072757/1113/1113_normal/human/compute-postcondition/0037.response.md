The value of `nRow` is appended with the string '1', which means that the current value of `nRow` will have '1' added to its end. The values of the other variables (`t`, `res`, `row`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is now `nRow + '1'**.
