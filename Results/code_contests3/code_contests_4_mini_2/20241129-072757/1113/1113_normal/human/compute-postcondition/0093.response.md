`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row` (which is not equal to '9'), `nRow` will now hold the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
