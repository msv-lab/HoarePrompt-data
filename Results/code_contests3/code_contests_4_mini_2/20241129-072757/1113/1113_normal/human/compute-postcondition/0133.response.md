The code `nRow += i` appends the current value of `i` to the string `nRow`. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is an empty string and `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` will contain the string representation of `i`, which is "0". The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4 for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is "0", and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
