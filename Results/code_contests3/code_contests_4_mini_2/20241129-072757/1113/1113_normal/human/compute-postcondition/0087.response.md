The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes input from the user and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous value of `nRow` is the input string `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'. However, since the loop does not execute a second time (as `i` is not less than 9), `nRow` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `nRow` is the input string `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `row` is the original input string.
Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `nRow` is the input string `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `row` is the original input string**.
