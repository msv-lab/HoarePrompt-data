The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This means the previous value of `nRow`, which was a string formed from `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', is now overwritten and lost. The values of `t`, `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `nRow` is '', `i` is 9, `row` is an input string without leading or trailing whitespace.**
