According to the code, the loop will execute a fixed number of times (9 times) regardless of the initial value of `t`. The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 8. For the loop to execute a second time, we need to ensure that it has completed its first execution successfully, which does not depend on `t`. However, since the task requires that `T` must be greater than 10^4 for the second execution, we need to acknowledge that `T` must be set appropriately before the loop starts. 

Thus, the relevant states for the loop's execution are:
- `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.
- `T` must be initialized or adjusted to ensure it will be greater than 10^4 after the first execution.

State: **`t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than 10^4**
