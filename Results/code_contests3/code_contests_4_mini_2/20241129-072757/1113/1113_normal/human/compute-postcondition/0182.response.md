The value of `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 10 strings, and since `nRow` is formed by replacing all '9's in `row` with '1', it will be a new string based on that transformation. The number of elements in `res` will increase by one. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings and `nRow` is appended to `res`, making it a list with 11 strings; `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string.**
