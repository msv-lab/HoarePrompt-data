`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, which appends the character '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The values of `t`, `row`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string with at least one character remaining, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated by appending '1'**
