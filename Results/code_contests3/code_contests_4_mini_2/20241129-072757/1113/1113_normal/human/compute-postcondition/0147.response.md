The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables, including `res`, `t`, `T`, `i`, or `row`. Therefore, the Output State remains as follows: `res` is a list containing 9 strings; `t` is 10^5; `T` is greater than 10^4; `i` is 9; `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is now an empty string.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings; `t` is 10^5; `T` is greater than 10^4; `i` is 9; `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is ''**
