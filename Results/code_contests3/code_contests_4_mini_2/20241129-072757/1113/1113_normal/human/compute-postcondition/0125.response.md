According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `T` must be greater than 10^4 and `t` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `t` will be 10^4 + 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings formed from the corresponding input string `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `t` is 10^5, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than 10^4**
