The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of other variables (`res`, `t`, `T`, `i`, `nRow`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `row` is now the input string stripped of whitespace, and `nRow` remains the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in the original `row` with '1', but its exact value cannot be determined until the input is provided.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.**
