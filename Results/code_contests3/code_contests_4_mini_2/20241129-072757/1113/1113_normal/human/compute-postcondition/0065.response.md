After the loop executes all 9 times, the variable `t` will still be between 1 and 10^4 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `res` will contain 9 elements, each of which is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in the corresponding input `row` with '1', while keeping all other characters unchanged. Each string `nRow` will have been appended to `res` during each iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4; `res` is a list containing 9 strings, each formed from the corresponding input string with all '9's replaced by '1'.**
