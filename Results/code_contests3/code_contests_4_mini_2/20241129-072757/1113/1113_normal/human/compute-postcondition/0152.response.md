The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the first character of `row`, it is a string. The impact of this code depends on how `nRow` was previously defined. However, without knowing the previous value of `nRow`, we cannot specify the exact outcome. The output state indicates that `nRow` will now include the string representation of `i` added to its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is incremented by `i` (the first character of `row`).

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is incremented by `i`.**
