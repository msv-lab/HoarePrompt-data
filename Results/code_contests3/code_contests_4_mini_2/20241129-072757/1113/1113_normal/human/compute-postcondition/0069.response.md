`nRow` is assigned the value of an empty string. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string**
