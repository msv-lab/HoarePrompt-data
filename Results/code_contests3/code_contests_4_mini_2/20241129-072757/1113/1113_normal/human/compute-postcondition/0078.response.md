The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 10. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, but it will increase by 10 after execution. The states of the other variables (`t`, `row`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `row` must have at least 10 characters, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is increased by 10.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` must have at least 10 characters, `i` is 10, and `nRow` is increased by 10.**
