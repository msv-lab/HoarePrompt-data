`row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take a string input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**
