According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, which means that `row` has at least 9 characters (since indexing starts from 0). The next character to be processed will be the one at index 9. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string, it can contain more than 9 characters, allowing the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be set to the next character in `row` at index 9. If `i` equals '9', then `nRow` will be set to '1'; otherwise, `nRow` will be set to '8'. 

Thus, the updated state needs to reflect that `i` is now 9, and the potential values for `nRow` depend on the character at that next index.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and for the loop to execute a second time, if `i` equals '9', then `nRow` is set to '1'; otherwise, `nRow` is set to '8'.**
