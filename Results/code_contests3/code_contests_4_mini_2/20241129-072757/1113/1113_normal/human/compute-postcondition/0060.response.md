`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an unknown value, the result will be that `nRow` is now the original `nRow` followed by '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `row` contains at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `next_char` is the character following `i`, and `nRow` is now concatenated with '1'.
