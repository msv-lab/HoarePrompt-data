According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently the second character of `row`. 

If the original length of `row` is at least 2, then after the current iteration, `i` will take the value of the next character in `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, the length of `row` must be at least 3, and `i` will then be the third character of `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the third character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters.**
