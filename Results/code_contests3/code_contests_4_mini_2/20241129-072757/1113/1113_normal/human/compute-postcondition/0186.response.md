The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it processes a fixed number of test cases, specifically `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer constrained to be between 1 and 10,000. Each test case consists of 9 lines, with each line containing 9 characters, where each character is a digit from '1' to '9', representing a valid Sudoku solution.

After processing the test cases, the function does not explicitly return a value. Instead, it likely outputs results based on the validity of the Sudoku solutions provided in the test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases of valid Sudoku solutions and outputs results based on their validity, without accepting any parameters.**
