Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the second character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
