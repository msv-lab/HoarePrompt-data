`nRow` is appended with '1', and since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 9, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is equal to '9'.
