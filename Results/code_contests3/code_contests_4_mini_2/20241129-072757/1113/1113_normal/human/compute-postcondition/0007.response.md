According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The current state indicates that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, but it does not influence the execution of the loop itself since it will be redefined by the `for` loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, for the loop to execute the first time `T` must be greater than 0 and `t` will be 0 during the first iteration**
