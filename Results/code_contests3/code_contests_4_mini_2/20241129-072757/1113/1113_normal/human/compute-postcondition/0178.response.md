The value of `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value. Since `nRow` is the previous value appended with '1', it will now contain its original value plus '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 10, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the previous value appended with '1' (now longer by one character).

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 10, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the previous value appended with '1'**
