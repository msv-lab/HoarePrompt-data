According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i`. The loop is set to execute for `i` in the range of 9, which means it will run for values of `i` from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`, but we need to consider that `i` must be incremented for the loop to execute again.

Since the loop has already executed for `i` from 0 to 8, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must become 9. However, `i` cannot reach 9 within this loop since the range is exclusive of the upper limit (9).

Thus, the loop cannot execute a second time without exceeding its defined range. Therefore, we conclude that the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings; `t` is 10^5; `T` is greater than 10^4; `i` is 9; `row` is a non-empty string; `nRow` is the result of replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; `nRow` is appended to `res`. The loop cannot execute again as `i` is equal to 9, which is the upper limit of the range.**
