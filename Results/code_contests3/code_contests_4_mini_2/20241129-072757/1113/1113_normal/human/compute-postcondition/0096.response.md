The variable `nRow` is being concatenated with the string '1'. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `nRow`, but it is important to note that `nRow` is being modified by adding the string '1' to it. The variables `t` and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is concatenated with '1'**
