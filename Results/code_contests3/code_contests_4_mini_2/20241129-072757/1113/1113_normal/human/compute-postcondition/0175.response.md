The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 9, we look at the conditional statement provided: since `i` equals '9', `nRow` is set to '1' before this line executes. Therefore, `nRow` will be incremented from '1' by '9'.

1. Before the operation, `nRow` is '1' (because `i` is '9').
2. After executing `nRow += i`, `nRow` becomes '1' + '9', resulting in '10'.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `nRow` and the unchanged values of other variables.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is 10**
