According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to '9', and for the loop to execute the next time, `i` must not be equal to '9'. Since `nRow` is '1' (because `i` was '9'), and for the loop to execute again, `row` must still be a non-empty string, and `i` must change to point to the next character in `row`.

Since `i` is currently '9', we will increment `i` to '0' (assuming a circular indexing for the sake of this example) if `row` has more characters. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `row` must still be a non-empty string, and the new value of `i` will be the character at the 0th index of `row`.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be '0' (the first character of `row`)**.
