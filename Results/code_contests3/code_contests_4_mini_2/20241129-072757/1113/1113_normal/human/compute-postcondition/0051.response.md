The variable `nRow` is incremented by the string '1', which appends '1' to its current value. The value of `i` is '9', but it is not affected by this operation. The initial state indicates that `res` contains `nRow`, so after executing the code, `nRow` will now have '1' added to its value. However, the exact previous value of `nRow` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State indicates that `nRow` has been modified.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'**
