The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the string '1'. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine its previous value. The execution of this code will append '1' to whatever `nRow` was previously. Other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 9, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` has been updated by appending '1' to its previous value.**
