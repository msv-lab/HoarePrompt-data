The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `i` is the next character in the string `row`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `nRow`, but it is affected by the addition of `i`. The impact of this operation is the concatenation of `i` to `nRow`. The values of `t` and `row` are not directly affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated by adding the next character `i` from `row`.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is updated by adding the next character `i` from `row.**
