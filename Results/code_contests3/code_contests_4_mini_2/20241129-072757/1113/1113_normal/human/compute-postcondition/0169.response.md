The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the operation, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1'**
