According to the code, the loop will execute for a fixed number of iterations, specifically 9 times, as determined by the `range(9)`. The state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 10^4 does not affect the loop's ability to execute since it is not used in the loop's control. However, for the loop to execute the first time, the variable `i` must be initialized to 0 (which happens automatically in the loop), and since `t` is stated to be between 1 and 10^4, we are not required to modify this particular state. 

Thus, the conditions for the loop to execute are met with `i` starting at 0, and since `t` can be any integer in the specified range, it will remain unchanged. 

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time, the range is 9**
