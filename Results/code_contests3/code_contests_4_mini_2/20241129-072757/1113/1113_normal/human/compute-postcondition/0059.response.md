According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. If the `row` has at least one more character left to iterate over, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row` after '9', and since `row` contains at least 2 characters, there is at least one character left to process. 

If `i` is currently the character after '9', we need to determine what the next character in the `row` is going to be for the next iteration. Letâ€™s denote that next character as `next_char`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `nRow` will be updated based on the value of `next_char`: if `next_char` is '9', `nRow` will be increased by 1, otherwise, it will increase by the numerical value of `next_char`.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `row` contains at least 2 characters, `i` is the next character in `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character after `i`, and the next character is `next_char`.**
