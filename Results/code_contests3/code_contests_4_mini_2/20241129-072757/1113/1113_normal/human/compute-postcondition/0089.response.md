According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. Given that `nRow` is an empty string and does not affect the loop execution, we can focus on the `row` variable. 

If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `row` must be a non-empty string, and since `i` is the character from `row`, it can be set to the first character of `row`.

State: **`t` is 10^4, `nRow` is an empty string, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `row`**
