The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` (which is 10) to `nRow`. Given that `nRow` was previously appended with '1', it is now a string that ends with '1' followed by '10'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 10, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, and `nRow` is the previous value appended with '10'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 10, `row` is a string with at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the previous value appended with '10'**
