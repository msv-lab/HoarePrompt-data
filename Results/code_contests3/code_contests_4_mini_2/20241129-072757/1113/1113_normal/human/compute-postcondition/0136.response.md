The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending '1' to it. Given that `nRow` is '1' if `i` is '9' and '0' if `i` is not equal to '9', the updated value of `nRow` will be '11' if `i` is '9' or '01' if `i` is not equal to '9'. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is either '11' or '01'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is either '11' or '01'**
