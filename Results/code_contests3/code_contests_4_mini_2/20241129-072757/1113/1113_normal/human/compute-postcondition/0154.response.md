According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row` and `row` is a non-empty string. For the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least one more character after the current position.

Since `i` is the first character of `row` at the end of the last iteration, if `row` has more characters, the loop can execute one more time. After the first character, `i` will take the value of the next character in `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the second character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters.**
