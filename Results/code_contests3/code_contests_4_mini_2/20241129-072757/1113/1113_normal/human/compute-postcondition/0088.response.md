The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string, effectively replacing its previous value which was derived from the original input string `row`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `row` also remains as is. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 10^4, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is the original input string.

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is the original input string**
