The variable `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The initial state indicates that `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 10,000, but since we do not have the actual input value provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `T`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `maxint` is positive infinity; `res` is an empty list; `T` is an input integer.**
