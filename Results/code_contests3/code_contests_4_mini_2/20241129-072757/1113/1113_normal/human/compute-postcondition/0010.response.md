The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect any of the previously defined variables: `t`, `res`, `i`, or `row`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string**
