The loop processes each character in the `row` string. For each character, if it is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`; otherwise, it appends the character itself to `nRow`. The loop will execute for each character in `row`.

Since `row` is the original input string and `nRow` begins as an empty string, after all iterations, `nRow` will contain the transformed version of `row` where every '9' is replaced by '1', and all other characters remain unchanged. 

The variable `t` remains constant at \(10^4\) throughout the loop. The variable `row` remains unchanged as the original input string. The final value of `i` will be the last character in `row`.

Output State: **`nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string, and `i` is the last character of `row`.**
