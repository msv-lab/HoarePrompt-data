`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where the initial value of `nRow` is '0'. Thus, after execution, `nRow` becomes '01'. The other variables (`t`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nRow` is '01', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`nRow` is '01', `t` is 10^4, `row` is the original input string with at least 1 character, `i` is 1**
