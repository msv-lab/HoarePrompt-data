According to the code, the loop is set to execute a total of 9 times, as specified by `range(9)`, which generates numbers from 0 to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, which is the last value in the range. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 9. However, since the range is from 0 to 8, there is no additional value for `i` within the specified range; thus, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, the relevant states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `t` remains 10^4.
- `nRow` is still the modified string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1'.
- `row` is the original input string.
- `res` remains unchanged as it has already been appended with `nRow`.

Since `i` will be 9 for the next iteration, and there is no further execution possible in the loop, we conclude that the loop cannot execute again.

State: **`t` is 10^4, `nRow` is the input string `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `row` is the original input string, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 9, which is not the case as `i` is 9**
