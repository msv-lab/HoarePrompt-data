According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts from 0 and goes up to 8 in the range defined by `range(9)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`, and since `row` is a non-empty string, `i` must be a character representing an integer value between 0 and 8. 

The loop can execute again only if `i` is less than 8. So, if the last value of `i` is 8 (which is the maximum for this loop), then the loop cannot execute again because the next value of `i` would be 9, which is not in the range of the loop.

Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. The next value of `i` will be 9, which is not valid for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 9 at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is 8, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is a string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.**
