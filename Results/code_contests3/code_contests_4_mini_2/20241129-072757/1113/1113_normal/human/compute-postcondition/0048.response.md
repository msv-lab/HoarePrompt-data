The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `res`, `i`, and `row`). Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains one additional element which is `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains one additional element which is `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.**
