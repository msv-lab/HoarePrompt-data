According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate over its characters. Since the current state specifies that `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should represent the first character of `row` in order for execution to begin. The string `row` will be iterated over character by character, starting from the first character.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string**
