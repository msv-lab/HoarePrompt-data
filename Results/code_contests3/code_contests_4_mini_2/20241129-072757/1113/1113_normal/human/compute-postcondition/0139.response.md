According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row` variable, which is an iterable. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` is currently pointing to the next character in `row`, we need to determine what the new value of `i` will be for the upcoming iteration. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` has to either be '11' or '01'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` will be updated to the value of `i`. 

To execute the loop again, `i` should take the next character from `row`. Therefore, if `row` has more characters, `i` will be updated to that next character, and `nRow` will be set according to the rules provided. 

Assuming there is at least one more character left in `row`, we can say the following:

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4, `i` is the next character in `row`, for the loop to execute again `row` must have at least one more character.**
