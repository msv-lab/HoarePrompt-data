According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. 

Before the loop starts, `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains an additional element which is `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string (which could be empty), and `nRow` is an empty string. The value of `i` is not relevant for the loop execution, as it will be overwritten by the loop variable.

To ensure the loop executes, `row` must not be an empty string. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `row` contains at least one character. The value of `i` will be set to the first character of `row` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` contains `nRow`, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` contains at least one character**
