The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is presumably a string. Since `nRow` was not defined in the initial state, we can infer that it starts as an empty string. Thus, appending '1' to it results in `nRow` being '1'. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is '9', `row` contains at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1'**
