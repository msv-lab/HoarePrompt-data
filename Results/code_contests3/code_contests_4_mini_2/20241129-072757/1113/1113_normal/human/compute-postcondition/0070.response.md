According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will run for each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is defined as the input string after stripping whitespace, for the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` is initialized to 0, which is correct as it will represent the current character being processed in the string. 

However, `nRow` is an empty string, which doesn't affect the execution of the loop but indicates that no rows have been processed or stored yet.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` is not an empty string, and `i` will represent the index of the first character in `row` during the first execution.

State: **`t` is 10^4, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
