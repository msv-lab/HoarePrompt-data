According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is therefore less than 9. Since the loop is designed to execute for values of `i` from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 times), it will execute one more time if `i` is less than 9. 

Given that `i` is currently less than 9, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. 

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is a list containing `nRow`, `nRow` is a string formed from `row` with all '9's replaced by '1', `i` is 9**
