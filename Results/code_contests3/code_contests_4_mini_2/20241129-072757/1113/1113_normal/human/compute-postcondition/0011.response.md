According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the last character in `row`. Before the loop starts, `t` does not affect the execution of the loop, while `res` being an empty list is fine as it will be modified within the loop body. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `i` will start from the first character of `row`.

State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `i` is the first character in `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` must contain at least 1 character**
