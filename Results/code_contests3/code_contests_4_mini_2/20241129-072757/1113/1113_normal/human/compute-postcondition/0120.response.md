The variable `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. Given that `nRow` is initially '01' and `i` is the second character in `row`, we do not have the specific value for `i` unless `row` is defined. Assuming `row` has at least 2 characters, `i` can be any character from `row`. 

Since the state of `i` is not explicitly defined, we can only state that `nRow` will change by appending `i` to it. Thus, the final output will reflect that `nRow` is now '01' concatenated with `i`, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nRow` is '01' concatenated with `i`, `t` is 10^4, `i` is the second character in `row`**
