The variable `nRow` is appended with the value of `i`. Given that `i` is the next character in `row` and `nRow` is '1' when `i` is '9', otherwise it is '0' when `i` is not equal to '9', the value of `nRow` will be updated accordingly. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` becomes '19' (since '1' + '9' = '19'). If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` becomes '0' + `i` (which is just `i`, as it takes the value of the `i` character).

Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `nRow` based on the value of `i`. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `t` is 10^5, `T` is greater than 10^4 for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated to '19' if `i` is '9', otherwise `nRow` is updated to `i`.**
