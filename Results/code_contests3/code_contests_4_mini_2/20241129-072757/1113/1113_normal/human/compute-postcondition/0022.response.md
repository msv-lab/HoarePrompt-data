The code snippet `nRow += '1'` appends the character '1' to the existing value of `nRow`. The initial state informs us that `t` is between 1 and 10^4 and that `res` is an empty list. However, the initial value of `nRow` is not specified, so we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation.

Since `nRow` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again, after executing the code, `nRow` will now contain the additional character '1'. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, and `nRow` is increased by '1', but its exact value is unclear.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, and `nRow` is increased by '1'**
