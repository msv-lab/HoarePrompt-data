According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least 11 characters, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 10, which means it has reached the 10th character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 11, and since `row` has at least 10 characters, it must have at least 11 characters to allow `i` to be 11. 

State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` has at least 11 characters, `i` is 11**
