The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, but the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. The variable `i` is also not defined in the given state. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `nRow` is increased by `i`, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.

Output State: **`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list, `nRow` is increased by `i`, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.**
