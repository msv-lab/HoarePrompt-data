Postcondition: ***`t` is between 1 and 10^4, `res` is an empty list. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to include '1' as its new value, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by `i`, and `row` must contain at least one more character for the loop to execute again.***
