`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The variable `i` is 11, but the previous value of `nRow` is not specified. Therefore, the output state describes the impact of the operation without a specific value for `nRow`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 10^4, `row` has at least 11 characters, `i` is 11, and `nRow` is increased by 11.**
