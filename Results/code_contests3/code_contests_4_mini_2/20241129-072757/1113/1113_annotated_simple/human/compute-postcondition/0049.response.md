According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, it does not influence the loop execution directly. 

To execute the loop, `row` must be a non-empty string, and `i` starts from the first character in `row`. Since `i` is specified to be 1 for the loop to execute a second time, it indicates that the loop has already executed once. 

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `row` must contain at least one character, and `i` will be the first character of `row`.

State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes the previous `nRow` appended to it, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
