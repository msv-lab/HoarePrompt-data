The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with '1'. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables (`t`, `res`, `row`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the previous `nRow` appended to it, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the previous `nRow` appended to it, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9'**
