`nRow` is assigned the value `nRow + i`. The variable `i` holds the value of the next element in `row`, and since `t` is 1 and we are executing the loop for one more time, `nRow` will be incremented by this value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will be updated accordingly. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.**
