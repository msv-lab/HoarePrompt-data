The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it is being updated by adding `i`. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
