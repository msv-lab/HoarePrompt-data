According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the contents of `row`. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 2, and `i` is currently a value from `row`. Since `t` is not directly influencing `row`, we need to consider the next element in `row` that `i` will take in the upcoming iteration. Given that `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` will be updated to include '1' this time, but since `i` must take the next value from `row`, we should also account for this.

To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration, we recognize that `i` will be updated to the next value in `row`, and we need to ensure that the program can execute the loop again. Therefore, we need to keep `res` as it is, but we should also specify the next value of `i` and the condition under which `nRow` is to be updated.

State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `i` will be the next value in `row`, and if `i` is '9', then `nRow` will include '1'; otherwise, `nRow` will be increased by the value of `i`.**
