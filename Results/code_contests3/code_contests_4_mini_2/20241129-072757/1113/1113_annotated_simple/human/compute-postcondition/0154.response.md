According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'. If `row` is a non-empty string, the next character in `row` will be assigned to `i`.

Given that `nRow` contains the first character of `row`, and `row` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute again if there are more characters in `row` after the current character `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will remain as the first character of `row`.

State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` contains the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and for the loop to execute a second time, `row` must have at least 2 characters.**
