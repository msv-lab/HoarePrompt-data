According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `row`. The loop iterates through each character in `row`, and since `row` is a non-empty string, it will execute for each character until all characters have been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that for the next iteration, the loop will process the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters beyond the current one, then the loop can execute again. Assuming `row` has at least one more character, the next character will replace `i` with that character.

For the loop to execute a second time, if `i` is '9' again, `nRow` will be updated to include '1'. If the next character is not '9', `nRow` will be incremented by that character, which corresponds to its integer value.

State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must contain at least one more character after the current one.**
