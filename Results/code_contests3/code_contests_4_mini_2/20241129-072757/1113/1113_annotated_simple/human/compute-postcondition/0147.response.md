The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This means that the previous value of `nRow`, which was the transformed version of `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', is now overwritten and lost. Other variables (`res`, `row`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is 9**.
