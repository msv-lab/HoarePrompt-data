The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its current value, which is '11'. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes '111'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '111', and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
