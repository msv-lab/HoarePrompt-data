The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating the current value of `i` to it. Since `nRow` is initially '11', the new value of `nRow` will be '11' + `i`. The variable `i` is the next character in `row`, but its specific value is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact result of the concatenation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` will be '11' + `i`, and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
