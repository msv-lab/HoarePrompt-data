`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is the next character in `row`. The previous value of `nRow` is updated based on the last value of `i`, but since we do not have that specific value, we cannot determine the exact result. The output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is updated based on the last value of `i`, `i` is the next character in `row**
