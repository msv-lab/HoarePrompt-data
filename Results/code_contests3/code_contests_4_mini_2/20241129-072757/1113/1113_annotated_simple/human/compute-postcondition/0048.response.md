The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This action does not affect the values of `t`, `res`, or `row`, but it resets `nRow` to an empty state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes the previous `nRow` appended to it, `row` is an input string, and `i` must be 1 for the loop to execute a second time.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` includes the previous `nRow` appended to it, `row` is an input string, and `i` must be 1 for the loop to execute a second time.**
