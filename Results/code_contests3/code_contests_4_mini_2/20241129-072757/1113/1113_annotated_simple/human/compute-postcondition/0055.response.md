According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `row`. The loop iterates through each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means the loop has processed one character from `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `res` includes the previous `nRow`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character left to process. 

Assuming `row` has at least one more character, `i` will become the next character in `row`. If `row` has more characters, `nRow` will be the previous value plus the new character represented by `i`, and `res` will continue to include the updated `nRow`.

Thus, if `row` has at least one more character, the next values would be:
- `i` becomes the next character in `row`.
- `nRow` will be updated based on the previous value plus `i`.
- `res` will include the updated `nRow`.

State: **`t` is 1, if `i` is the next character in `row`, then `nRow` is the previous value plus `i`, and `res` includes the updated `nRow`.**
