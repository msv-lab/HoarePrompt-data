The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will hold a string input from the user after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res`, `nRow`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the value of `row` will now reflect the user's input. Since `i` is 9, the loop would terminate without executing again. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', and `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace.**
