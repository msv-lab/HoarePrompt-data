The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `i`, `nRow`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
