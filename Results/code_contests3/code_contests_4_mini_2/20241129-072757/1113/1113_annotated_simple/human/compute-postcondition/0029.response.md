The code snippet `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` is not directly affected by this assignment, as it is being reset to an empty string. The other variables (`t`, `res`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 9, and `row` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 9, `row` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**
