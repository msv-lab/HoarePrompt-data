According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must not be an empty string. The variable `i` will take the first character of `row` during the first execution. 

So, for the loop to be executed:
- `row` must contain at least 1 character (i.e., it cannot be an empty string).
- `i` will be the first character of `row`.

State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `nRow` is '', `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace and must contain at least 1 character, `i` is the first character of `row`**
