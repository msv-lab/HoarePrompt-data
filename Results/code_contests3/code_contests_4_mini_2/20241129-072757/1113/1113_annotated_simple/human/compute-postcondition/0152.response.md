`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, `nRow` will now contain that first character. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` contains the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` contains the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**
