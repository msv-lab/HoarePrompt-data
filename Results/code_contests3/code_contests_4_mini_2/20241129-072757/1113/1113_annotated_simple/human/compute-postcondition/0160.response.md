`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` plus `i`. Since `nRow` contains the first and second characters of `row`, and `i` is the 10th character of `row`, `nRow` will now contain the first, second, and tenth characters of `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` must have at least 10 characters, `nRow` now contains the first, second, and tenth characters of `row`, and `i` is the 10th character of `row`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `row` must have at least 10 characters, `nRow` now contains the first, second, and tenth characters of `row`, and `i` is the 10th character of `row`.**
