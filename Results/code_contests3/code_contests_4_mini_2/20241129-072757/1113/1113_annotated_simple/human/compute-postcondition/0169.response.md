The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. However, the initial state does not mention the previous value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine its final value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the increments made to `nRow` but does not specify its value.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated to include '1'**.
