To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, we analyze the loop's behavior based on the initial state and the code provided.

1. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`.
2. If the character is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
3. If the character is anything else, it appends that character to `nRow`.
4. The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the iterations, retaining its value of 1.
5. The variable `res` still contains its initial value from before the loop began, which is the previous value of `nRow`.

Given these points, after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, `nRow` will consist of the characters from `row`, with each '9' replaced by '1'. If `row` is empty, then `nRow` will remain an empty string.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is the result of transforming each '9' in `row` to '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string.**
