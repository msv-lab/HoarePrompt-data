`nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next character in `row`, its specific value is not provided, but `nRow` is updated from its previous value. The value of `res` includes this updated `nRow`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `nRow` and the inclusion in `res`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus `i`, `res` includes the updated `nRow`.**
