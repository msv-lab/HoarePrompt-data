The variable `nRow` is being incremented by the value of `i`. Since `i` is currently 0, the value of `nRow` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 1, `i` is 0, and `nRow` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, and `nRow` remains unchanged**.
