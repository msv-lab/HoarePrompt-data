The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string `'1'` to the current value of `nRow`. Since `nRow` is updated based on `i` being 9, it implies that `nRow` currently holds some value (likely a string) that represents a collection of rows or elements. Appending `'1'` to `nRow` indicates that another row is being added.

Thus, the output state reflects that `nRow` has been updated by appending `'1'` and that the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is updated by appending '1', and `i` is the next element in `row`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is updated by appending '1', `i` is the next element in `row`**
