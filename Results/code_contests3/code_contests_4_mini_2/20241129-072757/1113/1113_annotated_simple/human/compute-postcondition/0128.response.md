The value of `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous value of `nRow` was the transformed version of the last input string, but it is now overwritten. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed; `i` is 1; `nRow` is an empty string; `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed; `i` is 1; `nRow` is an empty string; `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
