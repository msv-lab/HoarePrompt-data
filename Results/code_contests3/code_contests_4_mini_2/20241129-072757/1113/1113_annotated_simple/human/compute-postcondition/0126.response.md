According to the code, the loop is set to execute 9 times, starting from `i = 0` and ending at `i = 8`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be at least 1. Since `res` already contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, we can assume that the first iteration has already occurred, and we are currently at `i = 1`. 

The states that need to be confirmed for the loop to execute a second time are the values of `res`, `t`, `nRow`, and `row`. The requirement that `T` must be greater than `t` is also important, but it only ensures that the loop can potentially continue executing beyond the second iteration. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are as follows: `i` should be 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `T` should be greater than `t` to ensure that any additional conditions are met if the loop were to continue beyond the specified number of iterations.

State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than `t`, `nRow` contains the transformed version of the last input string, `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace**
