According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. Since `row` is defined as the last input string after stripping whitespace, it should contain at least one character for the loop to execute. 

Now, since `i` is initialized to 1 before the loop, it does not affect the loop execution, as `i` will be overwritten by the first character of `row` during the loop's first iteration. However, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` is not an empty string.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `row` must contain at least one character. If `row` is not empty, the first character of `row` will be assigned to `i` during the first iteration.

State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace and must contain at least 1 character for the loop to execute**.
