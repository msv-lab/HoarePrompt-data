According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute for each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 3, which might imply that the loop has already processed three characters of `row`. Given that `i` is the current character being processed, which is not equal to '9', we need to determine the next character for `i` in the next iteration.

Since `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, it contains at least 4 characters for the loop to execute again after 3 iterations. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the fourth character of `row`, which is not equal to '9'.

State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `row` must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character of `row`.**
