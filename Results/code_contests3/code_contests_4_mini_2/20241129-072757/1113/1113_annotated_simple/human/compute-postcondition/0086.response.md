According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate while `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character in `row`, which implies that `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3, and the loop will execute again as long as it remains less than 9.

State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`**
