In this code snippet, `nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The current state specifies that `res` already contains 10 transformed strings, and `nRow` is derived from `row` by replacing '9' with '1'. The value of `t` and the specific content of `row` do not directly influence the operation of appending `nRow` to `res`. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `nRow` to the existing list `res` without altering the other variables.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings; `t` is 2; `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
