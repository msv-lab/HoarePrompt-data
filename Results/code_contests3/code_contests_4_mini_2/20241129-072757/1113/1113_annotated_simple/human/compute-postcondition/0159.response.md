The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` previously contained the first and second characters of `row`, after the execution, `nRow` will now contain those two characters followed by `'1'`. Other variables, such as `res` and `i`, remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings; `nRow` contains the first and second characters of `row` followed by '1'; `i` is the 10th character of `row`.**
