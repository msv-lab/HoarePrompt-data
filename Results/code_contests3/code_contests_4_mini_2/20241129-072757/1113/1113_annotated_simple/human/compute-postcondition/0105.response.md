According to the code, the loop is set to iterate a total of 9 times, with `i` starting from 0 and going up to 8. The current value of `i` is 2 at the end of the last iteration, meaning the loop has executed 3 times so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 9.

State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings; `t` is 3; `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
