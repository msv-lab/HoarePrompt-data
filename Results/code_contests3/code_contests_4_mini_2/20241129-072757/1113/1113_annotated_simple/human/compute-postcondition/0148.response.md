According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `row`. For the loop to execute, the `row` must contain at least one character. The current state indicates that `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace. If `row` is indeed non-empty, then the loop can execute, and the first iteration will set `i` to the first character of `row`. However, if `row` is empty, the loop won't execute at all.

Since `nRow` is an empty string and `res` contains 10 transformed strings, these do not impact the execution of the loop, but we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one character.

For the loop to execute the first time, `row` needs to be a non-empty string, and the index `i` should be set to the first character in that string. 

State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
