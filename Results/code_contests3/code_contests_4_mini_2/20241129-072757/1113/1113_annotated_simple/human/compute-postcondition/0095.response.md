According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row` and processes each character `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 2, `res` contains 10 transformed strings, and `nRow` has been modified based on the value of `i`.

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` remains concatenated to its previous value. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`, where `i` is the first character of `row`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must contain at least one more character after the last processed character. Since `i` is currently the last character processed, we need to move to the next character in `row`.

Assuming that `row` has more characters, the next character will be processed in the next iteration. If `i` corresponds to the last character of `row`, then the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, the state must reflect that `nRow` has been updated based on the last character processed and that `i` will be set to the next character in `row` for the next iteration.

State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is updated based on the last value of `i`, `i` is the next character in `row`**.
