The code assigns an empty string to `nRow`. The previous value of `nRow` was the transformed version of `row`, but now it becomes an empty string. The other variables (`res`, `t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `nRow` is an empty string, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `nRow` is an empty string, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace**
