The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` is currently an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The states of the other variables (`res`, `i`, and `row`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1', and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is equal to '9', `nRow` is '1', and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
