The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`, which means that any previous value of `nRow` is overwritten. The values of `res`, `t`, and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings; `t` is 3; `nRow` is '' (an empty string); `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings; `t` is 3; `nRow` is ''; `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
