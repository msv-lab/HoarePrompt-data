The statement `res.append(nRow)` appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The variable `t` is not affected, and `nRow` is already defined as a string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged. Consequently, the output state reflects the updated state of `res`, which now includes `nRow`. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing each '9' in `row` with '1' and keeping all other characters unchanged, `res` now includes `nRow`.**
