The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of its previous state concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is unknown, but it will now represent the original value followed by '1'. The states of the other variables, `t` and `i`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated to its previous value concatenated with '1'**.
