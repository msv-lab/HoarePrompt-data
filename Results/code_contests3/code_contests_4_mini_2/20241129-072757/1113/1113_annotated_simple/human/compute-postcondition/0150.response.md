The value of `nRow` is incremented by appending the string '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is '9'**.
