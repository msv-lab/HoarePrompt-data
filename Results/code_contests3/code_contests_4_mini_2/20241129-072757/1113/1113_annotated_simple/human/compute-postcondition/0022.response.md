The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string '1', which means that `nRow` will now contain the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is updated to include '1'**
