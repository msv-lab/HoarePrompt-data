The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the affected variables (`res`, `t`, `i`, and `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings where each '9' is replaced with '1'; `t` is 2; `i` is 0; `row` is an input string; `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings where each '9' is replaced with '1'; `t` is 2; `i` is 0; `row` is an input string; `nRow` is an empty string.**
