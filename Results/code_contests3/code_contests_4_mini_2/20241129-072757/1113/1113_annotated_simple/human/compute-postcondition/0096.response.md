`nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to its previous value. The value of `nRow` is dependent on the last value of `i`, but since the exact value of `nRow` is not provided, we can only describe that it has a transformation. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is updated to include '1', `i` is the next character in `row`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is updated to include '1', `i` is the next character in `row`**
