According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the contents of the `row` list. If there are more elements in `row`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next element in `row`, and `t` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what happens to `i` and how it affects `nRow`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be updated to the previous value concatenated with '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` will be updated by adding `i` to its previous value. 

Since `i` is currently the next element in `row`, to execute the loop again, `i` must be the next element in the list. Therefore, after the current iteration, `i` will take the value of the next element in `row`, and `t` remains 1.

State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, for the loop to execute again `row` must have at least one more element.**
