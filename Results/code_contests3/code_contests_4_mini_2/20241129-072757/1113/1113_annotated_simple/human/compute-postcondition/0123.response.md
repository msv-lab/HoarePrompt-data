The code `res.append(nRow)` appends the transformed string `nRow` to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 11 transformed strings, so after the execution of the code, `res` will contain 12 transformed strings (the original 11 plus the newly appended `nRow`). The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`res` contains 12 transformed strings, `t` is the length of `row`, `nRow` contains the transformed string based on `row`, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
