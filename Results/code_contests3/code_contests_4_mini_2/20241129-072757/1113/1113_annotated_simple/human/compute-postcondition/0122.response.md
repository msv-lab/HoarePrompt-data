To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop, we analyze the provided code and the transformations applied to the variables.

The loop processes each character in the string `row`. For every character `i`:
- If `i` is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- If `i` is not '9', it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`.

Given that `res` contains 11 transformed strings and `t` is initially 3, we can infer that the transformations are based on the content of `row` and the presence of '9's in it.

After all characters in `row` have been processed:
- `nRow` will consist of all characters from `row`, with every occurrence of '9' replaced by '1'.
- The total number of characters processed will determine the final state of `nRow`, and `t` will reflect this as it increments by 1 for each character processed.

If `row` has a length of `m`, then after processing all characters:
- `nRow` will have a length equal to `m`, where every '9' in `row` has been transformed into '1'.
- `t` will be `m`, indicating the total number of characters processed.

If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `nRow` remains an empty string while `t` remains 3.

Considering these points, the final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is the length of `row`, `nRow` contains the transformed string based on `row`, and `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**
