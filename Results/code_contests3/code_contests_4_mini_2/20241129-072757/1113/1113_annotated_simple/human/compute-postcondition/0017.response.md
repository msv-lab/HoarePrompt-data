According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `row`. If `row` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `row` is a non-empty iterable. The next value for `i` will be the next element in the iterable `row`. Since the loop will execute one more time, `i` will be updated to the next element in `row`, and `t` remains unchanged. The condition regarding `nRow` only applies if `i` is equal to '9', which is not specified here.

State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more element.**
