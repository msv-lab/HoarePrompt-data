According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `t` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the length of the last input string, which is not directly relevant to the loop index but indicates the processing of that string. The loop variable `t` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `T`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `t` must be incremented. Therefore, if `t` is currently at its maximum value of `T-1`, for the loop to execute a second time, `T` must be greater than `t`, which implies `T` must be at least `t + 1`.

State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `t` is the length of the last input string, for the loop to execute a second time `T` must be greater than `t`, `nRow` contains the transformed version of the last input string, `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace**
