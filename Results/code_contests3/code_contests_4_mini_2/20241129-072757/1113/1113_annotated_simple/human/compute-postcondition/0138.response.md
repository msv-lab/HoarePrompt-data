Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '11', while `i` will be the next character in `row` and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is updated to '1' concatenated with `i`, while `i` will still be the next character in `row`, and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace.***
