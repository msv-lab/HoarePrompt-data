The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes an input string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous state of `row` is the last input string before stripping whitespace. Although the exact value of `row` after the operation is not known, its previous version is known. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is 1, `nRow` contains the transformed version of the last input string, and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed; `i` is 1; `nRow` contains the transformed version of the last input string; `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
