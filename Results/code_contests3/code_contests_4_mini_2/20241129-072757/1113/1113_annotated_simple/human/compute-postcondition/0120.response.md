The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`, which is the fifth character in `row`. Since `row` has at least 5 characters, `i` will hold a valid character. The initial states of `res`, `t`, and `row` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 4, `row` has at least 5 characters, and `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 4, `row` has at least 5 characters, and `nRow` is assigned the value of `i`.**
