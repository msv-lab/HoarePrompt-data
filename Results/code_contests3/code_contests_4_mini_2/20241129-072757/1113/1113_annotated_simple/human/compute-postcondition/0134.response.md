Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to '9', then `nRow` is updated to be the concatenation of `nRow` and `i`, while `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace and contains at least 1 character.***
