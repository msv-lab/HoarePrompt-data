According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. If `row` is an empty string, the loop will not execute at all. Before the loop starts, `t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, and `i` is 9, which will be overwritten by the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `row` should be a non-empty string and `i` should be reset to 0, as it will iterate over the characters in `row`.

State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is an empty string, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is reset to 0**
