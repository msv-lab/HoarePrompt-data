According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that the loop has processed the character '9'. For the loop to execute again, it must process the next character in `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it must contain at least 10 characters for the loop to execute one more time (as '9' is the 10th character). 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is defined as the first character of `row` followed by '1'. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will now be the next character after '9', which would be the 10th character in `row`. Therefore, `nRow` will now contain the first and second characters of `row`.

State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 10 characters, `nRow` contains the first and second characters of `row`, and `i` is the 10th character of `row`.**
