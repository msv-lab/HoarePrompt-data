Postcondition: ***`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '1' and `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace. Otherwise, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` is the first character of `row`, which is not equal to '9'.***
