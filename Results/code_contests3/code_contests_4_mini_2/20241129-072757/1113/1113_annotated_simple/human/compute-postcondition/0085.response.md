The value of `nRow`, which is the transformed version of `row` where every '9' is replaced with '1', is appended to the list `res`. Since `res` already contains 9 transformed strings, after this operation, it will contain 10 transformed strings. The values of `t`, `i`, and `nRow` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the last character in `row`, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the last character in `row`, `nRow` is the transformed version of `row`**
