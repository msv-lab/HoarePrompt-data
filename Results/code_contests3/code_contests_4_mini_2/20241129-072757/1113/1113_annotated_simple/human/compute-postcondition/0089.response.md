According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must contain at least one character. Given that `nRow` is an empty string, we need to ensure that `row` is not empty before the loop starts. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the current character in the string `row`. Since `i` is already initialized to 3, this value will be updated during the execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute the first time, `row` must contain at least one character, and `i` will be updated to the first character in `row` during the first iteration.

State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is now the first character in `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a string with at least 1 character**
