The value of `maxint` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This assignment does not affect the previously defined variable `t` or the `write` function. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write` function; `maxint` is positive infinity.
