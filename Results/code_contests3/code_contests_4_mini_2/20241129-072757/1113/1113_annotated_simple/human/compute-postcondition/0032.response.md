In the given code snippet, `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, so after the execution, `nRow` will hold the value '1'. The variable `t`, `res`, `row`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is reset to 0, and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is reset to 0, and `i` is equal to '9'**.
