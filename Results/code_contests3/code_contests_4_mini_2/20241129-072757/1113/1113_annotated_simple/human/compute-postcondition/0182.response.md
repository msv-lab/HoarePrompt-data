The variable `res` is a list that currently contains 11 transformed strings. The `nRow` variable is an input string with all '9's replaced by '1's, and it will be appended to the `res` list. The `append` method adds `nRow` to the end of the `res` list, increasing its length to 12. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` contains 12 transformed strings, `nRow` is the input string with all '9's replaced by '1's, `row` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace.**
