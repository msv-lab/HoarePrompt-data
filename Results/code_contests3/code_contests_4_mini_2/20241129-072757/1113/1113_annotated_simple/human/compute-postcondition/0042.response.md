The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 1. However, the previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so we cannot determine the new value of `nRow`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is increased by 1**
