The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The previous value of `i` is the next value from `row`, but since we don't have access to the specific value of `i` or `nRow`, we can only state that `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`. The contents of `res` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i**
