According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is currently '9'. This means the loop has processed one character from `row`, and `i` will take on the value of the next character in the string during the next iteration.

Since `row` is non-empty, there is at least one character left to process. After the last iteration, `i` will be assigned the next character from `row`, and since the loop is based on the length of `row`, to execute again, `i` will need to be the next character in `row`.

Thus, if `i` is '9', it implies that `nRow` would not be incremented by the value of `i` in the next iteration, but rather it would depend on the next character in `row`. 

State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute again `i` will be the next character in `row`**
