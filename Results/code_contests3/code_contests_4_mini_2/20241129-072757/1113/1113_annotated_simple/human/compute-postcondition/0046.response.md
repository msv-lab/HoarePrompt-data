According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which iterates from 0 to 8 (a total of 9 iterations). At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be 0 (the first iteration) and will increase by 1 with each subsequent iteration until it reaches 8. The current state indicates that `t` is 1, `nRow` is the result of transforming each '9' in `row` to '1', `res` has `nRow` appended to it, and `row` is a non-empty string.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 9. Since `i` is currently 0, it will become 1 after this iteration. 

State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is the result of transforming each '9' in `row` to '1', `res` includes `nRow` appended to it, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be 1.**
