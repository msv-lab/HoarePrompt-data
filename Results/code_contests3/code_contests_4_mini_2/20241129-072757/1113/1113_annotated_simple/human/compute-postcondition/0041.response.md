`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, it indicates that we cannot determine its previous value. Thus, the output state reflects that `nRow` is being modified by appending '1' to it, but we cannot specify its resulting value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `nRow` is modified by appending '1', but its initial value is unknown.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, `nRow` is modified by appending '1', but its initial value is unknown.**
