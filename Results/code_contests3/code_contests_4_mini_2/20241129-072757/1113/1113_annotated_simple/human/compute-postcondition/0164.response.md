According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last character of `row`, which is a non-empty string. The range for `i` is from 0 to 8, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. 

Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 on each iteration, the next value of `i` will be the character following the last character of `row`. If `row` consists of characters that are numeric (for instance, '0' through '8'), the next value should be 1 greater than the numeric value represented by the last character. 

Given that `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute again, if `i` is currently 8 (the maximum for the loop to continue), then `row` must be adjusted so that `i` can increment to 9 and thus terminate the loop.

State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 9 for the loop to terminate without executing again.**
