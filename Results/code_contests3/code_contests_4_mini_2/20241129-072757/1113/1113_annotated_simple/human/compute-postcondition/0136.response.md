The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The states of the other variables (`res`, `row`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` will be the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '11', and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` will be the next character in `row`, `nRow` is '11', and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
