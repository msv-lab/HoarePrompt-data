The value of `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The previous values of `res`, `t`, and `i` are not affected, and since `row` is dependent on user input, its specific value is unknown. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `row` as an input string.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings where each '9' is replaced with '1', `t` is 2, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string**
