The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is designed to process a number of test cases `t`, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Each test case consists of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters from '1' to '9', which represent a correct solution of a Sudoku puzzle. After executing the function body, it presumably processes these test cases and returns a result based on the validity of the Sudoku solutions provided.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases of Sudoku puzzles, each consisting of 9 lines of 9 characters, and returns validation results for these puzzles without accepting any parameters.**
