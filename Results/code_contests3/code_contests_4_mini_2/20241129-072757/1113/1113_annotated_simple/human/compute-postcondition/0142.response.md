Postcondition: ***`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated to '111' while `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to '11' concatenated with `i`, and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace.***
