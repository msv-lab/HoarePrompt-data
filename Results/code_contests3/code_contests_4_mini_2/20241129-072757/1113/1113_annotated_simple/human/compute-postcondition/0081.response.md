`nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Since `nRow` was not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end of its previous value. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next value from `row`, `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end of its previous value.**
