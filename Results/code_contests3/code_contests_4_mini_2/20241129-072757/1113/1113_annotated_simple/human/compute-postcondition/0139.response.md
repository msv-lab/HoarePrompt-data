According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', `nRow` has been updated to '11', and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to take on the next character in `row`. Since `i` is '9', we can expect that there is at least one more character in `row`. Thus, after the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be updated to '11' again since the last character can be '9'.

State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings plus the 9 input strings transformed, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` will be '11', and `row` remains the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
