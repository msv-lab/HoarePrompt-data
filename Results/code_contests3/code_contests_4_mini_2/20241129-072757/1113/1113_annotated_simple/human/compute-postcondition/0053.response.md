The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the value of `i` to it. Since `i` is the first character of `row` and is not equal to '9', `nRow` will now contain its previous value plus `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is the previous value plus `i`, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is the previous value plus `i`, `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
