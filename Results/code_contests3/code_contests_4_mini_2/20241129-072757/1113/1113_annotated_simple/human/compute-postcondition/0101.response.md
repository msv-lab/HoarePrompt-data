The value of `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`. The previous value of `nRow` is not specified, but it will increase by `i`, which is the next character in `row`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the added value of `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `row`, `nRow` is updated based on the added value of `i`.**
