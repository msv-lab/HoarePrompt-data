The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value `nRow + '1'`. Since `nRow` is not mentioned in the initial state, its previous value is unknown. However, the operation concatenates the string '1' to whatever the current value of `nRow` is. The values of the other variables (`res`, `t`, `row`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the transformation of `nRow` without specifying its previous value.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 4, `row` has at least 5 characters, where `i` is the fifth character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated to include '1'.**
