The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, which is currently the fourth character of `row`. The current states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `row` has at least 4 characters, and `i` is the fourth character of `row`; `nRow` is increased by `i`.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `row` has at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character of `row`; `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
