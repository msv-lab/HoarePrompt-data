The code snippet `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. The initial state specifies that `nRow` is the previous value plus `i`, where `i` is the next character in `row`. However, the current value of `nRow` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we cannot define a specific value for it. 

Since `nRow` is updated by appending '1', the new value of `nRow` becomes the previous value concatenated with '1'. The other variables `t` and `res` are not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is the previous value plus '1', and `res` includes the updated `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is the previous value plus '1', `res` includes the updated `nRow`.**
