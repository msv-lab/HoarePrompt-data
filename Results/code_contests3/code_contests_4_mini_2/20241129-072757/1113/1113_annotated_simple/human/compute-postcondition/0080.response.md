According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, and `i` is '9'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next value of `i` in the `row`. Since `i` is currently '9', according to the code logic, `nRow` will be increased by '1' in the next iteration. However, we also need to determine what the next value of `i` will be.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, we need to assume that the next value of `i` is taken from `row`, and `row` must contain at least one more element. If `row` contains at least one more element, `i` will be the next value from `row`, and `nRow` will be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next value from `row`, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more element.**
