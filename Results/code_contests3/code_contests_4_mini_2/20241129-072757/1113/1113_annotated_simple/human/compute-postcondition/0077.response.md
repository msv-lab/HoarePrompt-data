The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string '1', regardless of its previous value. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value of `nRow`, we can only state that it will now include '1' as part of its current value. Given that other variables remain unaffected, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `nRow` is increased by '1'.**
