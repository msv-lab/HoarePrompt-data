`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` contains the first character of `row` and `i` is the second character of `row`, after execution, `nRow` will now contain the first and second characters of `row` combined. The values of `res` and `row` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` contains the first and second characters of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` contains the first and second characters of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string.**
