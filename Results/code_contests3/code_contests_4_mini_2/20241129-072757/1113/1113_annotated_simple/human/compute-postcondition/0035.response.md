Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, if `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is '1', `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`, `res` still includes the previous value of `nRow`, `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.***
