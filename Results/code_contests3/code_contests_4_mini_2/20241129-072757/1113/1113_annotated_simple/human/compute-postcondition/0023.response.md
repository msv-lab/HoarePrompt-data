The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. The initial value of `i` is the next element in `row`, but the specific value is not provided. Therefore, we can't determine the exact new value of `nRow`. However, we do know that `nRow` is increased by whatever the value of `i` is. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is the next element in `row`, `nRow` is increased by `i`.**
