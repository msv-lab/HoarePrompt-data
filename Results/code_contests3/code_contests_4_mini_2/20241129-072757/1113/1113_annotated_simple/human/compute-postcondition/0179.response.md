The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` represents the next character in `row`, and since `nRow` is being incremented by `i`, it means that `nRow` will now include the next character from `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row`.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is updated to include the next character from `row`.**
