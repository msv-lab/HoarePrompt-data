`nRow` is updated by adding the value of `i`, which is 9. Since `nRow` is updated based on `i`, the new value of `nRow` will be the previous value plus 9. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 1. The loop will continue to execute since `row` will have at least one more element added. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `nRow` is updated by adding 9 to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is updated by adding 9 to its previous value.**
