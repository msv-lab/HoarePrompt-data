`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, but the initial value of `nRow` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the final value of `nRow`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `row`) remain unchanged. Hence, the output state reflects the unchanged values and notes the operation on `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1' to its previous value.**
