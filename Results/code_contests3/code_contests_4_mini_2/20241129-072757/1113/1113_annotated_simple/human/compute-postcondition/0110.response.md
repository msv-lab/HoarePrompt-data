The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. Since the previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `nRow` is '1', `row` is a non-empty string after stripping whitespace, `i` is '9'**
