The loop processes 9 input strings, transforming each string by replacing every occurrence of '9' with '1'. After each iteration, the transformed string is appended to the `res` list. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the `res` list will contain the transformed versions of all 9 input strings plus the 9 previously transformed strings that were part of the initial state.

Output State: **`res` contains 18 transformed strings, `nRow` is the transformed version of the last input string with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace.**
