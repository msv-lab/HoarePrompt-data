Before executing the code, we analyze the impact of the statement `nRow += i`. The variable `nRow` will be incremented by the current value of `i`, which is 0.

Since `i` is 0, the value of `nRow` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1, `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged, and the loop can execute as `row` is a non-empty iterable.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged**
