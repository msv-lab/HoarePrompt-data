The value of `nRow` is assigned the current value of `nRow` concatenated with the value of `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, after execution, `nRow` will contain that first character. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, and `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` contains 11 transformed strings, `t` is 3, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `row` is the input string after stripping whitespace, `i` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is not equal to '9'**.
