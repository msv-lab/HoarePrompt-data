The value of `nRow` is updated by appending the string '1' to it. The previous value of `nRow` is not provided, so we cannot determine its new value. The states of `res`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is updated by appending '1'.**
