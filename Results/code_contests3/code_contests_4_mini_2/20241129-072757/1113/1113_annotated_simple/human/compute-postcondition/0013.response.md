`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, the variable `nRow` has not been defined in the initial state, which means we cannot determine its previous value. Therefore, the output state indicates that `nRow` is being updated with an appended string '1'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is equal to '9'; `nRow` is updated with an appended string '1'**
