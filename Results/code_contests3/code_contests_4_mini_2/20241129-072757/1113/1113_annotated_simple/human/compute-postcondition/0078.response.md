In this code snippet, `nRow` is being updated by adding the value of `i`. The initial state indicates that `i` will be the next value in `row`, and if `i` is '9', then `nRow` will include '1'; otherwise, `nRow` will be increased by the value of `i`. 

However, since the specific value of `i` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical impact on `nRow`. Thus, we will generalize the output state based on the provided information.

Output State: **`res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is the next value in `row`, and `nRow` is increased by `i` or includes '1' if `i` is '9'.**
