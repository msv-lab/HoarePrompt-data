The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. The previous value of `nRow` is the first character of `row`, and it remains unchanged otherwise. Therefore, the updated value of `nRow` will be the first character of `row` followed by '1'. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`res` contains 10 transformed strings, `i` is the second character of `row`, `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '1', `row` is a non-empty string.**
