According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the list `row`. If `row` has more elements, the loop will execute for the next element in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, and `i` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in `row`.

If `i` is 9, then `nRow` is updated to its previous value plus '1', and `res` includes the updated `nRow`. For the loop to execute again, it will move to the next index in `row`. Assuming `row` contains more elements, `i` will take on the next value in the list.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `nRow` will be updated based on the conditions provided, and `i` will be the next element in `row`.

State: **`t` is 1, `nRow` is updated based on `i` being 9, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least one more element, and `i` will be the next element in `row`.**
