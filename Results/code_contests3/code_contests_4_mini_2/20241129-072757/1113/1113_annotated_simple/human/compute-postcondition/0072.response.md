The value of `nRow` is incremented by the string '1'. However, the previous value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains 9 transformed strings, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character in `row`, `i` is equal to '9', and `nRow` is updated to include '1' but its previous value is unknown.
