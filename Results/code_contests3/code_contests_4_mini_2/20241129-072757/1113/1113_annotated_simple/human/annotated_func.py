#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 9 lines containing 9 characters from '1' to '9', representing a correct solution of a sudoku puzzle.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))

            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is equal to `T`, `res` contains `9 * T` transformed strings where each '9' is replaced with '1', and `row` is the last input string after stripping whitespace (if T > 0).
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases of Sudoku puzzles, where each test case consists of 9 lines of 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9'. It transforms each '9' into '1' in the output. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs the transformed lines for each test case, concatenated with newline characters. It assumes valid input according to the specified format and does not handle any potential input errors or unexpected characters.
