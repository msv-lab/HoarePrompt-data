#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9', forming a valid sudoku solution.
def func():
    sys.stdout = io.BytesIO()
    atexit.register(lambda : os.write(1, sys.stdout.getvalue()))
    input = io.BytesIO(os.read(0, os.fstat(0).st_size)).readline
    write = sys.stdout.write
    maxint = float('inf')
    res = []
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        for i in range(9):
            row = input().strip()
            nRow = ''
            for i in row:
                if i == '9':
                    nRow += '1'
                else:
                    nRow += i
            res.append(nRow)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is `T-1`, `res` is a list containing `9 * T` strings formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in each corresponding input `row` with '1'; each string in `res` retains all other characters unchanged.
    write('\n'.join(res))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases of Sudoku solutions by reading 9 lines of input for each test case, replacing all occurrences of '9' in each row with '1', and then outputs the modified rows. It does not validate the Sudoku solutions but simply modifies the input as described.
