Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The task requires the program to change at most 9 elements of a valid Sudoku solution to create an "anti-sudoku," where each row, column, and 3x3 block contains at least two equal elements. 

However, the program only replaces occurrences of the number '9' with '1' without ensuring that the resulting grid satisfies the conditions for an anti-sudoku. This means that:

1. The program does not check or modify other numbers, which is necessary to ensure that at least two equal elements exist in each row, column, and 3x3 block.
2. The modification is not guaranteed to meet the requirement of at least two equal elements in all rows, columns, and blocks, as it simply replaces '9' with '1' without any further checks or modifications.
3. The program does not control the maximum number of changes (which must be at most 9) as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program fails to fulfill the requirements of the problem, making it incorrect.
