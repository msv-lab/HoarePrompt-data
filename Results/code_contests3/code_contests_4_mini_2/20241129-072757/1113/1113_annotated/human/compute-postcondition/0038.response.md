`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The current value of `nRow` is '1' (a string) and `i` is 10 (an integer). The operation attempts to concatenate the string '1' with the integer 10, which results in a TypeError in Python since you cannot directly add a string and an integer.

Since no variables are successfully updated due to the error, the output state reflects the unchanged values:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `i` is 10, and a TypeError occurs due to incompatible types.**
