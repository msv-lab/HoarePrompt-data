`nRow` is being concatenated with the string '1'. However, the variable `nRow` was not defined in the initial state. As a result, the code attempts to perform an operation on an undefined variable. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and an attempt to concatenate '1' to `nRow` fails due to `nRow` being undefined.
