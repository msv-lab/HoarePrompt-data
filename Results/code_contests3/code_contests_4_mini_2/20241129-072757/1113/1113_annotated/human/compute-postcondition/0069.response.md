The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`res`, `T`, `i`, `row`). Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 9 strings; `T` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace; `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings; `T` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace; `nRow` is an empty string.**
