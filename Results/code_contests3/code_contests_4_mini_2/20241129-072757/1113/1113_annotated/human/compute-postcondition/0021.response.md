According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. The variable `i`, which represents the current character in the iteration, is currently 1 (the second character of the string since indexing starts at 0). 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to look at the length of the `row` string. Since `row` is non-empty, it must have at least 2 characters, allowing for `i` to be 1. 

For the next iteration, `i` will need to be incremented to 2, which corresponds to the third character in the string `row`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `row`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be updated to 2, and the code will need to check the character at that position in `row`.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than the length of `row`.**
