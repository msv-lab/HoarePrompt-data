Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.***
