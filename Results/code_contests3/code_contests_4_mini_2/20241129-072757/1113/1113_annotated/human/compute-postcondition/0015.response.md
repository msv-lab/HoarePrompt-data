The variable `nRow` is being assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since the initial state does not provide a value for `nRow`, we cannot determine its exact new value. The variable `i` is 0, so `nRow` will remain unchanged after the operation. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `nRow` remains unchanged**
