The variable `nRow` is assigned an empty string. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is an empty string, `t` is 1, and `i` must be less than 9 for the loop to execute again.
