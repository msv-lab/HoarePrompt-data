The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of its previous state plus the string '1'. However, the initial state does not specify the previous value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value.
