According to the code, the for loop iterates over the string `row`. For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string, which it is according to the given state. The loop will assign each character of `row` to `i` in each iteration. Since `i` is less than 9, it will be adjusted to the first character of `row` on the first iteration.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is the first character of `row`**
