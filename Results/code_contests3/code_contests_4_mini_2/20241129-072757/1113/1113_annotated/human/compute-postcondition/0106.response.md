The variable `row` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables are not affected by this operation, so their previous values remain unchanged. The state of `nRow` would also need to be recalculated based on the new value of `row`, but that calculation is not performed until after this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made by this line of code.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is reset to 0 for the loop to execute again.**
