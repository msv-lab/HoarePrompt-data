To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we analyze the provided loop code and the initial state of the variables.

The loop iterates over each character in the `row` string. For each character:

- If the character is '9', '1' is appended to `nRow`.
- If the character is not '9', that character is appended to `nRow`.

Given that `row` is a string after stripping whitespace, it has at least one character since it is stated to be non-empty. The loop will process each character in `row`, transforming it based on the specified conditions.

If `row` contains a total of `m` characters, after all iterations:
- Each '9' in `row` contributes a '1' to `nRow`.
- Each character that is not '9' is added to `nRow` unchanged.

The final value of `nRow` will consist of all characters from `row`, where each '9' has been replaced by '1'. 

Thus, the output state after the loop has executed completely will summarize the final state of the variables:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'.**
