According to the code, the loop is structured to execute a specific number of times defined by `range(9)`. Since `i` is not defined at the end of the previous iteration, it indicates that the loop has completed its full cycle of iterations, which means `i` has reached 9. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented from its current state (which has reached its maximum value of 9). However, since `i` is already at 9, the loop cannot execute again because `range(9)` allows `i` to take values from 0 to 8 only.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we would need to reset or redefine the range, or `i` would need to be set back to a value less than 9, which is not possible in the current context without modifying the loop structure itself.

State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is reset to 0 for the loop to execute again**
