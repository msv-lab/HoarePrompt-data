`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with `i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, after execution, `nRow` will contain the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and the first character of `row` is not '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, `i` is the first character of `row`, and the first character of `row` is not '9'**
