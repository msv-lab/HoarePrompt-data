The statement `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the variable `nRow`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine the specific result of the operation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is the first character of `row`, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is equal to '9'; `nRow` is updated to include '1' at the end.**
