The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The current value of `nRow` is an empty string (`''`), and `i` is the first character of `row` (which is a non-empty string and not equal to '9'). Thus, `nRow` will now contain the first character of `row`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is now equal to the first character of `row`, `t` is 1, and `i` is the first character of `row`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is now equal to the first character of `row`, `t` is 1, and `i` is the first character of `row`.**
