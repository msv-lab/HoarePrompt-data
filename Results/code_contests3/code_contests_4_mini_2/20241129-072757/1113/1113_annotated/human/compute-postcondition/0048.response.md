The code `nRow = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nRow`. This means that any previous value of `nRow` is overwritten. Since `nRow` was previously the string representation of `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', it is now an empty string. The values of the other variables `t`, `res`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '', `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is 8, `row` is the input string after stripping.**
