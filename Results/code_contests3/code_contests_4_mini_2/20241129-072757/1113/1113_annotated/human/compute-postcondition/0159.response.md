The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself with the string '1' concatenated to it. However, there is no prior information regarding the value of `nRow`, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` has '1' concatenated to its previous value.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` has '1' concatenated to its previous value.**
