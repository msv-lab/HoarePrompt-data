To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to analyze the effect of the loop code on the variables. The loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. 

1. If the character `i` is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
2. If the character `i` is not '9', it appends `i` to `nRow`.

This process continues for every character in `row`. 

Since `row` is a non-empty string and `T` is greater than 1, we can conclude that the loop will iterate through all characters of `row`. 

- If `row` contains any '9's, `nRow` will include '1's corresponding to each '9' found in `row`.
- For all other characters, they will be directly appended to `nRow` without modification.

At the end of all iterations:
- `res` remains unchanged as a list of 19 strings.
- `T` still remains greater than 1.
- `row` remains the same non-empty string as provided initially.
- `nRow` will be the final constructed string based on the conditions met during all iterations.
- `t` remains 1 throughout since it is not modified in the loop.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is constructed based on the characters in `row` with '9's replaced by '1's, and `t` remains 1.**
