According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty string, it contains at least one character, allowing the loop to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, indicating the first character of `row` was processed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1 to process the next character in `row`. The value of `nRow` is dependent on the value of `i`; specifically, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is undefined. However, since `i` is currently 0, `nRow` remains unchanged for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1, and `nRow` remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `i` is 1, `nRow` remains unchanged**.
