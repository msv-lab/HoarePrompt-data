According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', which means that `nRow` is set to '1'. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character remaining to iterate through after '9'.

Since `row` is a non-empty string, it implies that there are characters left in `row` to iterate over. After processing '9', the next character will be processed in the loop. Therefore, `i` will take the next character from `row`, and `t` remains 1.

State: **`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is the next character in `row`, and `nRow` is equal to `i`, and `t` remains 1.**
