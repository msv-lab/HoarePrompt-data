According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop iterates over each character in `row`, and for the loop to execute a second time, the index `i` must be less than 9. Since `i` is already initialized to 1, it suggests that the loop has executed at least once, and we need to ensure that `row` contains enough elements for the loop to continue executing.

To ensure that the loop can execute a second time, `row` must have at least 2 characters (since `i` starts at 1). Additionally, we need to adjust the state to confirm that `i` is 1. 

State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the second time `row` is input stripped of whitespace and has at least 2 characters**
