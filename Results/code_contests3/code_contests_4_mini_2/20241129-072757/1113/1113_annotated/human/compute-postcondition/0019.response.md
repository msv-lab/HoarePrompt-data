The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. Since `i` is 1, `nRow` will increase by 1. The values of `t`, `row`, and `nRow` are affected, with `nRow` changing from its previous value to the new one. Since the previous value of `nRow` is unchanged, we don't know its specific value but can state that it has increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is increased by 1.**
