The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is 0, the operation `nRow += i` concatenates the string representation of `i` (which is "0") to `nRow`. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes "0". The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is "0", `i` is 0, and `i` is not equal to '9'.**
