According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i`, which will take values from 0 to 8 in the range of 9. The variable `t` does not directly impact the ability of the loop to execute. Since the loop will execute regardless of the value of `t`, the states needed for the first execution of the loop are that `i` must be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
