The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to `nRow`. Since `nRow` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an existing variable holding a string value. The value of `t` and `i` do not change, and the only affected variable is `nRow`, which will now contain its previous value concatenated with '1'. The output state reflects the updated value of `nRow`, while `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, `nRow` is the previous value of `nRow` concatenated with '1'**
