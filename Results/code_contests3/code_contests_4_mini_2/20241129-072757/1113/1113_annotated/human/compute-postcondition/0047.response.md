The value of `row` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which means it will be a string representing the input received after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The other variables (`t`, `nRow`, `res`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `nRow` is the string representation of `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 8, and `row` is the input string after stripping.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is the string representation of `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 8, `row` is the input string after stripping.**
