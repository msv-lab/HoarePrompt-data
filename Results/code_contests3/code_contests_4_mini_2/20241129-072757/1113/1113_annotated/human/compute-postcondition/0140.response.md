The code `nRow += '1'` appends the string '1' to the current value of `nRow`. Since the initial state specifies that if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is equal to '91'. Therefore, after executing the code, `nRow` will become '911'. If `i` is not '9', `nRow` will be the next character in `row` concatenated with itself, and then '1' will be appended to that result. However, the specific value of `row` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow` in that case but can express it.

The output state will reflect the changes made to `nRow` based on the condition of `i`. Thus, we have two possible output states depending on the value of `i`.

Output State: **`nRow` is '911' if `i` is '9'; otherwise, `nRow` is equal to the next character in `row` concatenated with itself followed by '1'.**
