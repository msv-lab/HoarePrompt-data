In this case, `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The current value of `nRow` is the second character of the string `row`, and the value of `i` is also the second character of `row`. Therefore, `nRow` will be updated to be two times the second character of `row`. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `row`, `t`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is now equal to two times the second character of `row`, `t` is 1, and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
