`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The initial state indicates that `res` already contains 21 strings, and `nRow` is a string derived from `row` where all '9's have been replaced with '1'. After appending, `res` will now contain 22 strings. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 22 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is a string derived from `row`, `t` is 1**.
