`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`, where `nRow` is the first character of `row` and `i` is the second character of `row`. Since both `nRow` and `i` are characters, the operation concatenates the two characters. The initial state indicates that `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, so the output state reflects that `nRow` now contains the first two characters of the `row`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `nRow` is the first two characters of `row`, `i` is the second character of `row`.**
