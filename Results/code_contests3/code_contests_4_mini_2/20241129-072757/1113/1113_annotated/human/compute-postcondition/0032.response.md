`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` plus '1'. The variable `nRow` is initially an empty string, so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The states of the other variables (`t`, `res`, `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is '9'.
Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is '9'**
