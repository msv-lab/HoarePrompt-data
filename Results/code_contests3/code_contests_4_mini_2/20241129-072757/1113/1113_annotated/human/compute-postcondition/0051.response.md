`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after execution, `nRow` will be `'1'`. The values of `t`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is 9.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is 9**
