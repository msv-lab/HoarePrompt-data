The assignment `nRow = ''` resets the variable `nRow` to an empty string. The previous value of `nRow`, which was formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', is now lost. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change made to `nRow` while mentioning that other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is '', `i` is reset to 0 for the loop to execute again.**
