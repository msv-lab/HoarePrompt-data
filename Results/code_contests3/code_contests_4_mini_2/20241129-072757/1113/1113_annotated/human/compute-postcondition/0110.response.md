The value of `nRow` is concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is an empty string, so after execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1', and `i` is equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '1', `i` is equal to '9'**
