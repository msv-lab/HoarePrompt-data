To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's operation concerning the `row` input string.

The loop iterates over each character in the `row`. For every character:
- If the character is '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`.
- If the character is not '9', it appends the character itself to `nRow`.

Considering that `row` is a non-empty input string, by the end of the loop:
- `nRow` will be constructed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1' while keeping all other characters unchanged.

Thus, after all iterations:
- `res` remains a list containing 21 strings,
- `T` is still greater than 1,
- `row` is unchanged,
- `nRow` will be a string where all '9's in `row` have been replaced with '1',
- `t` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is a string derived from `row` where all '9's have been replaced with '1', `t` is 1.**
