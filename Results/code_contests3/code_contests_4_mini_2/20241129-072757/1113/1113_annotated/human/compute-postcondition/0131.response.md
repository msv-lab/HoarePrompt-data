The value of `nRow` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with the string '1'. Initially, `nRow` is an empty string, so after execution, `nRow` will be '1'. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9', `t` is 1, and `nRow` is '1'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is '9', `t` is 1, `nRow` is '1'**
