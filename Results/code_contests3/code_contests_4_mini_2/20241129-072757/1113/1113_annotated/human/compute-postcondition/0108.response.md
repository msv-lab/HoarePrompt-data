According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. Since `row` is an input string, it must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. The variable `i` has been reset to 0, which is appropriate for the loop to start iterating from the first character of `row`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `row` must not be an empty string. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 1 character, `nRow` is '', `i` is 0**
