According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The variable `i` represents the first character of `row`, which is non-empty. For the loop to execute again, `row` must still have more characters after the current character `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, and `i` is the first character of `row`.

If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` gets updated to include '1' at the end. If `i` is not '9', then `nRow` is increased by `i`. After processing the current character, the next character in `row` will be assigned to `i` for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character remaining. If `i` was the first character, and we assume `row` has more characters, then we need to define the state as follows:

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 2 characters remaining, and `i` will be the second character of `row`.**
