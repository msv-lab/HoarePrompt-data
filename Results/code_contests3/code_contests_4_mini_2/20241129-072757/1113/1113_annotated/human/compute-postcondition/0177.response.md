According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. The current character `i` is the second character of `row`. Since `row` is a non-empty input string, it has at least two characters. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least three characters, so `i` will be updated to the third character in the string during the next iteration.

The condition regarding `nRow` and `t` does not affect the loop's execution for the next iteration; it only pertains to the content of `row` and how it is processed within the loop.

State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`.**
