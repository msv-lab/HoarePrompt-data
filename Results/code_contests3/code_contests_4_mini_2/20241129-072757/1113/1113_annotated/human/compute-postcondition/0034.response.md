`nRow` is concatenated with the value of `i`, which is 1. Therefore, the new value of `nRow` becomes '1' since it was originally an empty string. The states of other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 1**
