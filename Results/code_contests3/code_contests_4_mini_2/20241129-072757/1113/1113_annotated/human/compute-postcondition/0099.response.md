According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. If `row` has at least one more character beyond the current index `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is '9', meaning it corresponds to the last character of `row`. Since `nRow` is determined based on the value of `i`, for the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to the next character in `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` will be the first character of `row` followed by '1', and `i` will be the second character of `row`. 

The conditions indicate that for the loop to execute a second time, the length of `row` must allow for characters beyond the current index '9'. Therefore, `row` must have at least 11 characters, and `i` must be the next character in the sequence.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '1', and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
