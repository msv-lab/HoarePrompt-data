The variable `res` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `t`, `write`, and `maxint` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is float('inf'); `res` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is float('inf'); `res` is an empty list.**
