Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the second character of `row`. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i` followed by '1', and `t` remains 1. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `t` remains 1, and `nRow` is incremented by `i`.***
