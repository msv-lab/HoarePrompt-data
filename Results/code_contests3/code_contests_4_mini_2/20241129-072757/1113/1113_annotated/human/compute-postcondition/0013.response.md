The code `nRow += '1'` will append the string `'1'` to the existing value of `nRow`. However, the variable `nRow` is not defined in the initial state. Since `nRow` is not previously assigned a value, this operation cannot be performed, and it implies that there is an attempt to concatenate a string to an undefined variable. 

Therefore, the output state should reflect that there is an issue with the state of `nRow`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is '9', `row` is a non-empty string, and `nRow` is undefined**.
