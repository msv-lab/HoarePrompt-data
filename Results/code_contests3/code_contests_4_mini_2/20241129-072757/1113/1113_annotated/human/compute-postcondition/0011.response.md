According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must not be an empty string. Given that `t` is 0 and `i` is 0 before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `row` contains at least one character.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
