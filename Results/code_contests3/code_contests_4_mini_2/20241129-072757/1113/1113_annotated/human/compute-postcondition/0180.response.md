Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, and `i` is the third character of `row`. If `i` is '9', `nRow` is increased by appending '1' to its previous value. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.***
