According to the code, the loop will execute based on the `row` variable, which is an input string after stripping. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. The current state indicates that `i` is 8, which may not correspond to the first character in `row`, assuming `row` has characters. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `row` is a non-empty string and that `i` is reset to 0 to reference the first character when the loop begins.

State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '', `res` includes the previous `nRow`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string**
