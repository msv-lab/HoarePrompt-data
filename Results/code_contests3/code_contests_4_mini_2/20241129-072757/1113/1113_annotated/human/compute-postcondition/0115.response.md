`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. However, the initial state does not mention the previous value of `nRow`, indicating it may not have been defined prior to this code snippet. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is being concatenated with '1' which may lead to an error if `nRow` is undefined.
