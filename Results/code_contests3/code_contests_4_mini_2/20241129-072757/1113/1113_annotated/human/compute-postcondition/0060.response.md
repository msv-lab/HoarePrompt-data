`nRow` is assigned the value of the string '1' concatenated with its previous value. However, since the initial state does not provide a prior value for `nRow`, we assume it was previously defined and thus the concatenation will result in `nRow` being updated. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is 2, and `nRow` has been updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, and `nRow` has been updated by concatenating '1' to its previous value.**
