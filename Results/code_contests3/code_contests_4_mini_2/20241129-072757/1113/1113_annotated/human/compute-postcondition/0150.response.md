The value of `nRow` is updated by concatenating '1' to it. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `nRow` becomes '1'. The other variables (`res`, `T`, `row`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `t` is 1, and `i` is '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is '1', `t` is 1, and `i` is '9'**
