The `append` method is called on the list `res`, adding the value of `nRow` to the end of the list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 19 strings plus `nRow`, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is constructed based on the characters in `row` with '9's replaced by '1's, and `t` remains 1.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is constructed based on the characters in `row` with '9's replaced by '1's, and `t` remains 1.**
