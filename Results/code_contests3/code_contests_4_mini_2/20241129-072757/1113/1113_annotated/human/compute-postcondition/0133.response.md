The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the existing string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is not equal to '9', the resulting value of `nRow` will be just the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is not equal to '9', `t` is 1, and `nRow` is equal to `i`.**
