The code snippet `nRow += i` increments the value of `nRow` by `i`. However, the current value of `nRow` is not provided in the initial state. The initial state specifies that `t` is 0 and `i` is 2, but does not mention `nRow`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `nRow`. 

The execution does not change the values of `t` or `i`. We simply know that `nRow` has been incremented by 2.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, and `nRow` is incremented by 2**
