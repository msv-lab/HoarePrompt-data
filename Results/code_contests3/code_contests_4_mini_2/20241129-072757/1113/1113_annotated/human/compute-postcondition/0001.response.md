The code registers a function to be called upon normal program termination. This function writes the contents of `sys.stdout`, which is currently redirected to an instance of `io.BytesIO()`, to the standard output (file descriptor 1). The value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; the function to write `sys.stdout.getvalue()` is registered to be called at exit.**
