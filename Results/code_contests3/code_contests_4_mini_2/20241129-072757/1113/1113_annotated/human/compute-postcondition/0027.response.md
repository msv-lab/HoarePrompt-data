According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 9. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. The condition for the loop to execute is still that `i` must be less than 9.

State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; the value of `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `i` must be less than 9.**
