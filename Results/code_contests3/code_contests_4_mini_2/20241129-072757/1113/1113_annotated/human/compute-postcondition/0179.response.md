The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The value of `i` is the third character of the string `row`, which has at least 3 characters, and the previous value of `nRow` is unknown. Therefore, the output state includes the condition that `nRow` is updated based on its previous value and the character `i`. The values of `res` and `T` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is updated by adding `i` to its previous value.**
