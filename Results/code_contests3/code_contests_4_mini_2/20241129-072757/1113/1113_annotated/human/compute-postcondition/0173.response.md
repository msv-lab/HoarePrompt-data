According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first character of `row`, and since we are iterating through `row`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the next character in `row`. 

Given that `row` is a non-empty string, and after one full iteration where `i` is the first character, the next character would be the second character in `row`. The value of `nRow` will also be updated to this new character. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is now equal to the second character of `row`, `t` is 1, and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
