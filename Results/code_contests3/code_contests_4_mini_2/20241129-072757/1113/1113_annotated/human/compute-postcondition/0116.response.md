The variable `nRow` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The initial value of `nRow` is not provided, but since it is being incremented, its new value will be `nRow + 1`. The states of the other variables (`res`, `T`, `row`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `nRow` is incremented by 1**
