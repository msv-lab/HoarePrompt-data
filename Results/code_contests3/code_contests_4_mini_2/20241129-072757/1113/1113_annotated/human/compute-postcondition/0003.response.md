The code assigns the function `sys.stdout.write` to the variable `write`. This means that `write` is now a reference to the function that outputs text to the standard output. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`**.
