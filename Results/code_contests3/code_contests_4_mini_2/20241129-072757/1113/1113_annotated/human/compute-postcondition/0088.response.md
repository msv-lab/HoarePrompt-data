`nRow` is assigned an empty string `''`. This action does not affect any other variables, as `nRow` was previously a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. The state of `row`, `res`, `T`, and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, and `i` is less than 9.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is an empty string, `i` is less than 9**
