The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. However, the initial value of `nRow` is unknown. The variable `i` is derived from the third character of the string `row`, which is guaranteed to be at least 3 characters long. Therefore, the value of `i` is well-defined as the character at that position. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`, and `nRow` is increased by the value of `i`.**
