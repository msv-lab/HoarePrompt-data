According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute as long as there are more characters in `row` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the first character of `row`. After the loop iterates over the first character, `i` will be set to the next character in `row` for the next iteration. 

If `row` has more than one character, the loop can execute again. Since `nRow` is determined based on the first character of `row`, which is not '9', `nRow` will remain unchanged for the next iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character remaining, and `i` will be the second character of `row`.

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
