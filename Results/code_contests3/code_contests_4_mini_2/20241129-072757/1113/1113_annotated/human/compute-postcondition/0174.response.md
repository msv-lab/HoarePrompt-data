`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The previous value of `nRow` is equal to the second character of `row`, which is a single character string. Therefore, after execution, `nRow` becomes the second character of `row` followed by '1'. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by '1', `t` is 1, `i` is the second character of `row`.**
