`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`. The previous value of `nRow` is '1', so after execution, `nRow` becomes '11'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `nRow` is '11', `row` must have at least 10 elements for the loop to execute a second time, and `i` is 10.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '11', `row` must have at least 10 elements for the loop to execute a second time, and `i` is 10.**
