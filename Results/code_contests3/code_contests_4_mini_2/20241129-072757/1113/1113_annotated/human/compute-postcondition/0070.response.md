According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `row`. The loop will execute for each character in the string `row`. For the loop to execute at least once, `row` must contain at least one character. 

Given the initial state where `res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string, we need to ensure that `row` is not empty. 

Additionally, the variable `i` will be overwritten during the loop execution, as it will iterate over each character in `row`. 

To summarize:
- For the loop to execute, `row` must be a non-empty string.
- The first character of `row` will be assigned to `i` during the first iteration.

State: **`res` is a list containing 9 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is the first character of `row`, for the loop to execute the first time `row` is a non-empty string.**
