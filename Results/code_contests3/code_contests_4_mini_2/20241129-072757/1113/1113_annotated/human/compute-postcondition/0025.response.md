To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we can examine the provided code and the initial state. 

The loop iterates over each character in the `row` string. For each character `i`, if `i` equals '9', it appends '1' to `nRow`. Otherwise, it appends the character `i` itself to `nRow`. 

Letâ€™s deduce the output state based on the behavior of the loop:

1. If `row` is a non-empty string, each character will either be '9' (which transforms to '1' in `nRow`) or remain unchanged if it is any other character.
2. The final value of `nRow` will be a transformation of the original `row` string, replacing every '9' with '1'.
3. Since `t` is not modified within the loop, it will remain 0.
4. The value of `i` at the end of all iterations will not be relevant as it will be the last character iterated over but is not needed for the final state.

Thus, considering these points, if the loop executes on a non-empty `row`, the final output state will reflect the transformation of `row` in `nRow`.

If `row` is empty, the loop does not execute; thus, `nRow` remains an empty string.

Given these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `row` is the original input string.**
