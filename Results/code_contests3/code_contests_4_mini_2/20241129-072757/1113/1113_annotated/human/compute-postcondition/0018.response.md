`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow` concatenated with the string '1'. The value of `nRow` remains unchanged prior to this concatenation, so it will now contain its previous value followed by '1'. The values of `t`, `row`, and `i` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `nRow` is concatenated with '1'.**
