According to the code, the for loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the range provided, which is 9 in this case. The variable `i` starts at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 8. After the last iteration, `i` is 8. Since the loop is set to execute for `i` in the range of 9, it cannot execute again as `i` is equal to the upper limit (9) of the range.

Therefore, there is no adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time because it has already completed all its iterations. 

State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1', for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9**
