The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`. Since `i` is '9', `nRow` is initially '91', and appending '9' results in '9191'. The value of `t` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is equal to '9191', and `t` remains 1.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is equal to '9191', and `t` remains 1.**
