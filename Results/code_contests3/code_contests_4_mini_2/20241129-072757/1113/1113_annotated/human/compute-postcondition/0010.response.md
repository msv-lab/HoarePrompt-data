The variable `nRow` is initialized as an empty string. The values of `t`, `i`, and `row` remain unchanged, as the assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, and `nRow` is an empty string.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 0, `row` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `nRow` is an empty string**
