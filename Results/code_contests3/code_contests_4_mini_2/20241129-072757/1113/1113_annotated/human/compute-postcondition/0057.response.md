`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + i`. The current value of `nRow` is '0' (a string), and `i` is 1 (an integer). In Python, adding a string and an integer will raise a TypeError, as they cannot be concatenated directly. Therefore, we cannot determine a new value for `nRow`. The previous values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '0', `i` is 1 and a TypeError occurs due to attempting to add a string and an integer.**
