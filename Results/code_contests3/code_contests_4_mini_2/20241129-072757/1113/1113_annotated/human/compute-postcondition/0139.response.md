According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `row` is a non-empty string, which means it has at least one character. The variable `i` represents the current character from `row`. 

If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is set to '91' (the concatenation of '9' with '1'), and if `i` is any other character, then `nRow` is set to `i + i` (which effectively doubles the character). The variable `t` remains at 1 regardless of the value of `i`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `row` must have at least one more character following the current character represented by `i`. Thus, if `i` is currently the last character of `row`, then the loop cannot execute again. If `i` is not the last character, then we can simply increment our understanding of `i` to the next character.

If we assume that the current character `i` is not the last character, the next value of `i` will be the next character in `row`, and `nRow` will be set accordingly based on whether the new `i` is '9' or not.

State: **`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, if `i` is '9', then `nRow` is equal to '91' and `t` remains 1. Otherwise, `nRow` is equal to the next character in `row` concatenated with itself and `t` remains 1.**
