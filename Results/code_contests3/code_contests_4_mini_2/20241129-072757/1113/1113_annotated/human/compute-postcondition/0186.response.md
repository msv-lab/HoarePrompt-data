The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. It processes multiple test cases of Sudoku solutions, where each test case consists of 9 lines of 9 characters representing digits from '1' to '9'. 

The function checks if each Sudoku solution is valid based on Sudoku rules. It returns results for each test case. Since there are multiple test cases, the function will return a list of results, where each result indicates whether the corresponding Sudoku solution is valid or invalid.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases of Sudoku solutions and returns a list indicating the validity of each Sudoku solution.**
