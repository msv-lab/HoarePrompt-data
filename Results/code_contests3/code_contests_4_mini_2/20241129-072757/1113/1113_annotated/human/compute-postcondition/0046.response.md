According to the code, the for loop will execute a total of 9 times, with `i` starting from 0 and going up to 8. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be 8. Since the loop is structured to iterate from 0 to 8, it will not execute again if `i` is already 8.

To execute one more time, `i` would need to be incremented to 9, but this is outside the valid range for the loop (which is 0 to 8). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, it cannot happen under the current structure since the loop will not run if `i` equals or exceeds 9.

State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is the string representation of `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, for the loop to execute again `i` must be less than 9 (but it is already 8).**
