The code appends the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. The previous state indicates that `res` is a list containing 9 strings, and `nRow` is a string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'. Therefore, after the execution, `res` will contain one additional string, which is the value of `nRow`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every '9' in `row` with '1'**.
