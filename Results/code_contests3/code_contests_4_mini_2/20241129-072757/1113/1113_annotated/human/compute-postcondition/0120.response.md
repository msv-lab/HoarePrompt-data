The value of `nRow` is incremented by `i`, which is 2. However, the previous value of `nRow` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value after the addition. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `nRow` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, and `nRow` is increased by 2.**
