The code `nRow += i` appends the value of `i` to the string `nRow`. Since `nRow` is initially an empty string and `i` is the first character of `row`, the value of `nRow` will now be equal to `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `i`, `t` is 1, and `i` is the first character of `row` and is not equal to '9'.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is `i`, `t` is 1, and `i` is the first character of `row` and is not equal to '9'.**
