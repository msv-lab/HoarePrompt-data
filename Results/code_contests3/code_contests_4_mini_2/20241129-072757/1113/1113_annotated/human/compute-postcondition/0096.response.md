The variable `nRow` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'1'`. Since `nRow` is originally the first character of `row`, after this operation, `nRow` will be that character followed by the string `'1'`. The values of the other variables (`res`, `T`, `row`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `nRow`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '1', and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
