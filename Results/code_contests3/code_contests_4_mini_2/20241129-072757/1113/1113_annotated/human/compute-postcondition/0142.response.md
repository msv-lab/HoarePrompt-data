Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 19 strings, `T` is greater than 1, and `row` is a non-empty string. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is '911' and `t` remains 1. Otherwise, `nRow` is equal to the next character in `row` concatenated with itself followed by '1'. In the else part, `nRow` is '9191' and `t` remains 1.***
