`nRow` is a string with the value `'11'` and `i` is 10. When we perform the operation `nRow += i`, Python will attempt to concatenate the string `nRow` with the integer `i`. However, since these are different types, this operation will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '11', `i` is 10, and a TypeError occurs due to attempting to concatenate a string and an integer.**
