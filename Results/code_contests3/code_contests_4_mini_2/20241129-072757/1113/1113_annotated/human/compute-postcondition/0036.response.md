According to the code, the loop iterates over `row`, which is assumed to contain multiple elements. The variable `i` determines the current iteration index. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', and `res` includes `nRow` as a new element. Additionally, `i` is currently '9'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next element in `row`. If `row` has at least 10 elements, then the current state of `i` being '9' implies it will be incremented to '10' for the next iteration. If `i` is reset to '1', it suggests that `row` does not have enough elements for `i` to reach '9' again. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain the state of `t`, confirm that `nRow` remains the same, and adjust `i` to '10'.

State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '1', for the loop to execute a second time `row` must have at least 10 elements, and `i` is 10**.
