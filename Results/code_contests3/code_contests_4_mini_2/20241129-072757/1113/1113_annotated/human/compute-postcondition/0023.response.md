The code `nRow += i` increments `nRow` by the value of `i`. The initial state shows that `i` is 2. However, there is no previous value provided for `nRow`, so we cannot determine its new value. The other variables `t` and `row` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, and `nRow` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `row` is a non-empty string, `i` is 2, and `nRow` is increased by 2.**
