According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the iterable `row`. If `row` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since the loop executed because `i` equals '9', `nRow` is '01'. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute successfully, `row` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`t` is 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `row` must have at least 2 elements.**
