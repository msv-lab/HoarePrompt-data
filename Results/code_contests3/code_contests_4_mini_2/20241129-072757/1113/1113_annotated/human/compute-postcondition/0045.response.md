The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the value of `nRow` as a new element to the list `res`. The values of `t` and `nRow` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the inclusion of `nRow` in `res`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is the string representation of `row` with all occurrences of '9' replaced by '1', and `res` includes `nRow` as a new element.**
