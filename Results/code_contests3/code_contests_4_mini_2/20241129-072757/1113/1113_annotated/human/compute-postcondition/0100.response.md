`nRow` is assigned the value of its previous state concatenated with '1'. The initial state indicates that `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '1', so after execution, `nRow` will have one additional '1' appended to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` must have at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '11', and `i` is the second character of `row`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `row` must have at least 11 characters, `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '11', and `i` is the second character of `row`.**
