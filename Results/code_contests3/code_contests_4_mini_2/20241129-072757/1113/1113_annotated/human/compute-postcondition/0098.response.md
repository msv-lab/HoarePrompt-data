Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 10 strings and `T` is greater than 1. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '1', and `i` is the second character of `row`. Otherwise, `nRow` is the first two characters of `row`, and `i` remains the second character of `row`.***
