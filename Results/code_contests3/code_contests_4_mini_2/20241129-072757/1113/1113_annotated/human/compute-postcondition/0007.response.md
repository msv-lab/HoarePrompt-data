According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. The loop will execute `T` times, which means `T` must be at least 1. The variable `t` is being used as the loop index, and it will start at 0 during the first iteration. 

Before the loop starts, the state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, but this is not relevant to the loop's execution since `t` is initialized by the loop itself. 

For the loop to be executed the first time, `T` needs to be greater than 0, and `t` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `T` is greater than 0**
