Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty input string, and `i` is the second character of `row`. If `i` is equal to '9', then `nRow` is the second character of `row` followed by '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is equal to two times the second character of `row`, while `t` remains 1 and `i` is still the second character of `row`.***
