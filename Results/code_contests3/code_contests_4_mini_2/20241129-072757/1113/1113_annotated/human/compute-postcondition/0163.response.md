`nRow` is appended to the list `res`. The previous value of `res` contains 20 strings, and `nRow` is a new string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'. Since `res` is being modified by adding `nRow` to it, the size of `res` will increase by one. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', `t` is 1, and `i` is no longer relevant.**
