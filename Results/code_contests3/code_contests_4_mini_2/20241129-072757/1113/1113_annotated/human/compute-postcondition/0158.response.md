According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `row`. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is a non-empty string, and `i` is the second character of `row`. For the loop to execute one more time, it must move to the next character in `row`. 

If `row` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. Since `i` is currently the second character of `row`, the next value of `i` will be the third character of `row`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `row` must have at least 3 characters, `i` will become the third character of `row`, and the loop will continue processing based on the logic provided.

State: **`res` is a list containing 20 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character of `row`**
