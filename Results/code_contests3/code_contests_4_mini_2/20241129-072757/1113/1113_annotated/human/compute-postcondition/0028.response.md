The variable `row` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input from the user and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of the other variables (`t`, `nRow`, `res`, and `i`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `row`.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1'; `res` includes `nRow` as a new element, `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `i` must be less than 9; `row` is input stripped of whitespace.**
