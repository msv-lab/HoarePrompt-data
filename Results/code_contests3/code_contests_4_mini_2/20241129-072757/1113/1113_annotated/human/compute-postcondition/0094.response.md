Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 10 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string. If the first character of `row` is '9', then `nRow` is '1'. Otherwise, `nRow` is the first character of `row`, and the first character of `row` is not '9', with `i` being the first character of `row`.***
