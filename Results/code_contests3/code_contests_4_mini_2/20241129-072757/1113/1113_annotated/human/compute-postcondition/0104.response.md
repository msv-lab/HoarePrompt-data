The code `res.append(nRow)` adds the value of `nRow` to the list `res`. Since `res` initially contains 10 strings, it will now contain 11 strings after executing this line of code. The other variables (`T`, `row`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated state of `res`.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 11 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is a non-empty string, `nRow` is the string formed by replacing every occurrence of '9' in `row` with '1', `i` is not defined as the loop has completed.**
