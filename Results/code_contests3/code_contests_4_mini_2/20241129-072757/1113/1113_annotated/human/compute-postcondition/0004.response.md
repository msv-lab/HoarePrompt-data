The code assigns the value of `float('inf')` to the variable `maxint`, which represents positive infinity in floating-point representation. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `write` still points to `sys.stdout.write`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `maxint` and the unchanged values of `t` and `write`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `write` is assigned to `sys.stdout.write`; `maxint` is float('inf')**
