The value of `row` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `nRow`, which was formed by replacing all occurrences of '9' in `row` with '1', will depend on the new value of `row` after the input is provided. The other variables `res`, `T`, `nRow`, `t`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is formed by replacing '9' in the new `row` with '1', `t` is 1, `i` is no longer relevant.

Output State: **`res` is a list containing 21 strings, `T` is greater than 1, `row` is an input string, `nRow` is formed by replacing '9' in the new `row` with '1', `t` is 1, `i` is no longer relevant.**
