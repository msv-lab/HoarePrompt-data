According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `row`. The variable `i` represents the current index in the iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `nRow` is either '1' or '0', depending on whether `i` was '9'. However, since `i` is currently 0, `nRow` must be '0' because `i` is not '9'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to point to the next element in `row`. Assuming `row` has more elements, `i` will now be 1. The value of `nRow` will depend on whether the new value of `i` equals '9'. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is 1, and `nRow` will still be '0' since `i` (1) is not equal to '9'.

State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '0', `i` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time**
