Postcondition: ***`res` is a list containing 10 strings. If `i` is '9', then `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '11'. Otherwise, `nRow` is updated to be the concatenation of its previous value and `i`, while `nRow` is the first character of `row` followed by '1' and `i` is the second character of `row`.***
