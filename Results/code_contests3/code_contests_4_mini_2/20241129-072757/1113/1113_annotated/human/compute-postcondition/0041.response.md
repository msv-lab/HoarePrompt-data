`nRow` is assigned the value of `nRow + '1'`, where `nRow` is initially '11'. Therefore, `nRow` becomes '111' after the execution. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition for the loop to execute a third time still depends on `row`, but since we don't have any information about `row`, it won't affect the output state. 

Output State: **`t` is 0, `nRow` is '111', `i` is 10**
