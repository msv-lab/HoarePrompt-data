Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm as described in the problem statement. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads input using `input()` and `raw_input()`, which are not compatible in Python 3. The use of `raw_input()` suggests that this code is intended for Python 2, and it will fail in Python 3 where `input()` should be used for all input reading.

2. **Incorrect Use of `map`**: The variable `nums` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which returns a map object in Python 3. This map object is an iterator and cannot be directly used with `len()` or indexed with `nums[i]`.

3. **Modification of `nums` During Iteration**: The program attempts to remove the maximum element from `nums` while iterating over it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and results since modifying a list while iterating through it can cause skipped elements or errors.

4. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for determining if the sorting can be done correctly is flawed. The loop checks for adjacent elements but does not properly simulate the ravioli sliding effect described in the problem. It only sets the `flag` to `False` if it finds any adjacent elements that differ by 2 or more, but it does not take into account that this condition can cause the stacks to change before the tallest stack is chosen.

5. **Output Logic**: The output logic `print['NO', 'YES'][flag]` is incorrect. In the context of the problem, the flag should actually dictate the output directly as "YES" or "NO", but the way it is implemented here does not clearly reflect the required output format.

Due to these issues, the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description, and thus it cannot guarantee correct results for all potential cases.
