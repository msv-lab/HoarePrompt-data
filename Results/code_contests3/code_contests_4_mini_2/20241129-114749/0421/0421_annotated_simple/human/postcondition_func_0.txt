The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 100). It checks if the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the list is less than 2. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False. It continues checking until all maximum values are removed from the list. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True (indicating all adjacent differences were within the limit) and 'NO' if the flag was set to False. The code may not handle cases where there are fewer than 2 elements in the list correctly, as the loop may not execute as intended.
