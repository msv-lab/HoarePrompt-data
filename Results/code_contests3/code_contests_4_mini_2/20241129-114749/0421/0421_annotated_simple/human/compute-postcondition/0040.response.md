Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements before removing the maximum value, and `i` is less than or equal to `len(nums) - 2. If the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
