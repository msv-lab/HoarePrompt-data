The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements after removing the maximum value, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
