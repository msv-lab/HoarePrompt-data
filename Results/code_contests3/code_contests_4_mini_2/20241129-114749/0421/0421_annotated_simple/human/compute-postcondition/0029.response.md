According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `i` is 1, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

The loop will execute again if `i` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2, which means `len(nums) - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2.

State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2.**
