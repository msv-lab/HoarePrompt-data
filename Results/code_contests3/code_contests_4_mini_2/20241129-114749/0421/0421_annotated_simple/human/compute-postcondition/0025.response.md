According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `nums`. The loop iterates from 0 to `len(nums) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, and `nums` has at least 2 elements, which means `len(nums)` is at least 2. The loop variable `i` is set to iterate from 0 up to `len(nums) - 2`. 

Since the loop has already executed once, `i` would have been incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 again, making it `1`. For the loop to execute another time, `len(nums)` must still be greater than `i + 1`, which is `2`. 

Thus, to execute one more time, `len(nums)` must be greater than `2`.

State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, and `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2, and `i` is 1.**
