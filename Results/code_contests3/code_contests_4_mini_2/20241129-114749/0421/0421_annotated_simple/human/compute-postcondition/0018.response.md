The `max(nums)` function finds the maximum value in the `nums` map object, and then the `remove` method removes the first occurrence of that maximum value from `nums`. The previous state of `nums` is affected, as one element (the maximum) is removed. The other variables (`n`, `flag`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is now a map object with the maximum integer removed, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` or equal to `len(nums) - 2` depending on the loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is now a map object with the maximum integer removed, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` or equal to `len(nums) - 2**
