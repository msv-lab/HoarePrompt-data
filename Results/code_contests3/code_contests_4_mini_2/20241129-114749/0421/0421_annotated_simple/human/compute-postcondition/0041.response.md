According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is less than or equal to `len(nums) - 2`, meaning there is at least one more iteration possible. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently less than or equal to `len(nums) - 2`, after the increment, it will be equal to `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute again, and we need to ensure that `len(nums)` remains the same (i.e., it still has at least 2 elements after removing the maximum value).

State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements after removing the maximum value, `i` is `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to execute one more time.**
