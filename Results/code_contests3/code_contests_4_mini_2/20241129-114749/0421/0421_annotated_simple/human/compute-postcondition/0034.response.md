The `nums.remove(max(nums))` statement removes the maximum value from the `nums` map object. Given that `nums` has at least 2 elements, this operation is valid, and the length of `nums` will decrease by 1 after execution. The other variables (`n`, `flag`, `i`) remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `nums` while noting that the other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is either True or False, `nums` is a map object with one less element after removing the maximum value, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` or equal to `len(nums) - 2.**
