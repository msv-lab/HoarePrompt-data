The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, but it was already set to `False` in the initial state, so there is no change. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements after removing the maximum value, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements after removing the maximum value, `i` is 1**.
