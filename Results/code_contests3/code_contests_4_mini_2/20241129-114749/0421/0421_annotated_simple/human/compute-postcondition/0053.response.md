The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters in the definition provided. Instead, it operates on input values that are expected to be given in a specific format: an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) indicating the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` (where 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the elements of this array. 

Since the output details are not specified in the prompt, we can only infer that the function processes the input values according to the stated constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing elements of an array and performs operations based on these inputs. The specific output behavior is not detailed in the prompt.**
