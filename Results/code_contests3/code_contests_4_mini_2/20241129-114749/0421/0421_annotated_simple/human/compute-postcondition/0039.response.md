The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements before removing the maximum value, `i` is less than or equal to `len(nums) - 2, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
