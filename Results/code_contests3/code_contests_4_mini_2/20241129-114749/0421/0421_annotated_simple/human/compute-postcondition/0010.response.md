The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, which does not change its previous state since it was already `False`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `i` must be less than 1, but this assignment does not alter the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
