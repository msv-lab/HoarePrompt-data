To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop with respect to the variable `flag` and the map `nums`.

The loop iterates through the elements of `nums`, comparing each element with the next one. If the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements is 2 or greater, `flag` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks immediately. 

If the loop completes all its iterations without breaking, it means that all adjacent elements in `nums` had an absolute difference of less than 2, and `flag` remains `True`.

Given that `nums` is a non-empty map object of integers converted from the input string `n`, and since we know that the loop will execute at most `len(nums) - 1` times, we can deduce the following outcomes:

1. If the absolute difference between any two adjacent integers in `nums` is 2 or greater, `flag` will be set to `False`, and the loop will break.
2. If all adjacent integers in `nums` have an absolute difference of less than 2, `flag` will remain `True`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop will reflect the final value of `flag` based on the conditions above. 

Output State: **`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is either True or False depending on the absolute differences of adjacent integers in `nums`, `nums` is a non-empty map object of integers, and `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1` if the loop executed fully or equal to `len(nums) - 2` if the loop was broken early.**
