Postcondition: ***`n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is set to False, and `nums` is a map object with at least 2 elements after removing the maximum value. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` remains False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
