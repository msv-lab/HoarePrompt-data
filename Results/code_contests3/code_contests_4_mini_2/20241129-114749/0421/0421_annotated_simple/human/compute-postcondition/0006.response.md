The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input string representing a valid integer, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map object of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` and index `i + 1` in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
