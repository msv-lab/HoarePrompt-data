According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is set to True, which is fine for the loop to execute. However, `nums` must also be a non-empty iterable for the loop to proceed. Since `nums` is a map object, it will be empty if the input string `n` does not contain any numbers or if it contains only whitespace. 

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `n` must contain at least one valid integer representation (e.g., "1", "2", etc.) when split. Therefore, we can conclude that `n` must not be an empty string or contain only whitespace.

State: **`n` is an input string representing an integer with at least one valid integer value, `flag` is True, and `nums` is a non-empty map object of integers converted from the split input string.**
