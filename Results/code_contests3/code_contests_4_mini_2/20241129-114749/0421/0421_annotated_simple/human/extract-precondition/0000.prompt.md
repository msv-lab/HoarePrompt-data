You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: Everybody knows of [spaghetti sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_sort). You decided to implement an analog sorting algorithm yourself, but as you survey your pantry you realize you're out of spaghetti! The only type of pasta you have is ravioli, but you are not going to let this stop you...

You come up with the following algorithm. For each number in the array ai, build a stack of ai ravioli. The image shows the stack for ai = 4.

<image>

Arrange the stacks in one row in the order in which the corresponding numbers appear in the input array. Find the tallest one (if there are several stacks of maximal height, use the leftmost one). Remove it and add its height to the end of the output array. Shift the stacks in the row so that there is no gap between them. Repeat the procedure until all stacks have been removed.

At first you are very happy with your algorithm, but as you try it on more inputs you realize that it doesn't always produce the right sorted array. Turns out when two stacks of ravioli are next to each other (at any step of the process) and differ in height by two or more, the top ravioli of the taller stack slides down on top of the lower stack.

Given an input array, figure out whether the described algorithm will sort it correctly.

Input

The first line of input contains a single number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) — the size of the array.

The second line of input contains n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the elements of the array.

Output

Output "YES" if the array can be sorted using the described procedure and "NO" if it can not.

Examples

Input

3
1 2 3


Output

YES


Input

3
3 1 2


Output

NO

Note

In the second example the array will change even before the tallest stack is chosen for the first time: ravioli from stack of height 3 will slide on the stack of height 1, and the algorithm will output an array {2, 2, 2}.
Function definition:
```
def func():
