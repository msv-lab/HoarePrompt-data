Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where stacks of ravioli slide down onto lower stacks when they differ in height by two or more. 

For example, consider the input:

```
3
2 1 3
```

According to the problem description, when the algorithm evaluates the stacks, the tallest stack (which is 3) should be selected. However, before it can do so, the stack of height 3 will slide down onto the stack of height 1 because they differ in height by 2. 

As a result, instead of outputting an array that reflects the correct sorting process, the program may not accurately determine the ability to sort the input array. Instead, it will simply check adjacent pairs for height differences but will not simulate the sliding effect correctly, leading to incorrect outcomes.

Thus, the program does not work as expected in this case, confirming that it is incorrect.
