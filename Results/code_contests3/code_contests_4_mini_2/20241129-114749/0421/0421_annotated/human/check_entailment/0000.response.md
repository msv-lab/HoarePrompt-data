Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem statement. Here are the main issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should be replaced with `input()`. Additionally, `n` is read as a string and is not used to validate the input size properly.

2. **Modification of `nums`**: The program attempts to use `nums` as a mutable list when it is actually a map object in the line `nums = map(int, raw_input().split())`. This should be converted to a list to allow for mutation.

3. **Checking Adjacent Elements**: The program checks if any two adjacent elements have an absolute difference of 2 or more. However, it does this before removing the maximum element. The algorithm should simulate the process of removing the tallest stack, which could allow ravioli from a taller stack to slide onto a shorter stack. The program fails to consider the effect of this sliding on the height of the remaining stacks.

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop continues while `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty, but it does not account for the fact that the removal of the maximum element could cause further sliding and thereby change the heights of adjacent stacks. The logic to check the pairs of adjacent elements should be revisited after each removal.

5. **Final Output**: The output logic uses `print['NO', 'YES'][flag]`, which is incorrect syntax in Python. It should be `print('NO' if not flag else 'YES')`.

Overall, the program does not properly simulate the ravioli sliding effect described in the problem statement, and therefore does not guarantee correct results for all input cases. For example, the input `3 1 2` will lead to a situation where the taller stack (3) would slide onto the 1, causing an unexpected outcome. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
