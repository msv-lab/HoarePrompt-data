The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is `False`.**
