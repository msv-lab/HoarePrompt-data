Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `flag` is set to `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
