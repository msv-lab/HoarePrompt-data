The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, and `flag` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
