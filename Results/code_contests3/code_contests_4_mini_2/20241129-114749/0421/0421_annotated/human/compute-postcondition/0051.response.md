Output State: **`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False if there was any pair of consecutive integers in `nums` with an absolute difference of 2 or more, otherwise `flag` is True; `nums` is an empty list as all elements have been removed through the iterations of the loop.**
