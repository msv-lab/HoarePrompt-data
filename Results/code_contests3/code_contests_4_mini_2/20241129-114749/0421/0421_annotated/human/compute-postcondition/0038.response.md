The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
