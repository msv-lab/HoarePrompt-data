The value of `flag` is assigned to `False`, which is its initial value and remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
