Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least one integer, `i` is 0, and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
