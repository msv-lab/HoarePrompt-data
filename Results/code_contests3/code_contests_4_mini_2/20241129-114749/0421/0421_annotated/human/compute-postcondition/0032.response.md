Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, and `nums` contains at least two integers. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any state change.***
