According to the code, the loop executes based on the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which implies that `nums` must contain at least one integer (to ensure the loop iterates) and that its length must be at least 1. 

Given the current state, `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is `True`, and `nums` must contain at least one integer for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we can conclude that:

1. `nums` must currently contain at least one integer for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

Thus, the state can be expressed as follows:

State: **`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is True, `nums` contains at least one integer, `i` is 0**
