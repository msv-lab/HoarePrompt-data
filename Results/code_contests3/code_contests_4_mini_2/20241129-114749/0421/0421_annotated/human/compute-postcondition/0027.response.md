The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` contains at least two integers, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
