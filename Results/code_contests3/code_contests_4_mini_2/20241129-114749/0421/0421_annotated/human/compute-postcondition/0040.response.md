Postcondition: ***`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part to consider.***
