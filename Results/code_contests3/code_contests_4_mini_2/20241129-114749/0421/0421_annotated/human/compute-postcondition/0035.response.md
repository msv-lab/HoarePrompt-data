According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop can execute again if both `flag` is True and `nums` is non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` remains either True or False, and `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with the maximum value removed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must remain True, and `nums` must still be non-empty. Since `nums` had the maximum value removed but is stated to be non-empty, it indicates that there are still elements left in the list. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to `flag` or `nums`.

State: **`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` remains True, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with the maximum value removed**.
