According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty (or truthy). Right before the loop, `flag` is True, which is fine, but `nums` is a map object. A map object is considered truthy only if it has at least one element. Since `n` is a string input, for the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a string that can be converted into integers, which means it should contain digits or valid integer representations. 

Therefore, to ensure that `nums` has elements, `n` needs to be adjusted so that it can be converted into a non-empty list of integers. 

State: **`n` is a valid string that can be converted into a non-empty list of integers; `flag` is True**
