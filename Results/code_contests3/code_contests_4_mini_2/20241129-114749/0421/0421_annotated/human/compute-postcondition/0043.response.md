The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
