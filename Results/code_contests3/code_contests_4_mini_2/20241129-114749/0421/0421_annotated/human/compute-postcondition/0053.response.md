The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the size of the array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai`, which are the elements of the array. The integer `n` must be in the range of 1 to 10, and each element `ai` must be in the range of 1 to 100. The function does not explicitly return any value or output as described in the constraints provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` along with `n` integers as elements of an array, adhering to the specified constraints on their values. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) as elements of an array.**
