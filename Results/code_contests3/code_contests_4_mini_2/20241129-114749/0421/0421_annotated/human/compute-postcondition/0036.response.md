According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 2`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be greater than `1` (since `len(nums) - 1` needs to be at least `0`). 

Given that `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with the maximum value removed, it is implied that `nums` must have at least `2` integers for the loop to execute. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, the variable `i` should be initialized to `0`, which is the starting point of the loop index.

State: **`n` is a valid string that converts into a non-empty list of integers, `flag` remains True, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
