The value of `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which takes the input as a string. Since `n` is supposed to represent the size of the array as an integer, the output state will reflect that `n` is a string input. Other variables are not affected at this point, so the output state is simply that `n` is a string.

Output State: **`n` is a string input**
