The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by `n` space-separated integers (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing elements of an array. It checks if every pair of consecutive integers in the array has an absolute difference of less than 2. If any such pair is found, it sets a flag to False. The function continues removing the maximum element from the list until it is empty. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True (indicating all pairs met the condition) or 'NO' if at least one pair did not meet the condition. Note: The removal of elements and the check for the flag is done in a way that could lead to unexpected behavior if `nums` is empty or if there are other edge cases in the input handling.
