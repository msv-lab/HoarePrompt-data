#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the array, followed by n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the elements of the array.
def func():
    n = input()
    flag = True
    nums = map(int, raw_input().split())
    while flag and nums:
        for i in xrange(len(nums) - 1):
            if abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]) >= 2:
                flag = False
                break
        
        nums.remove(max(nums))
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array; `flag` is False; `nums` is an empty map of integers; `i` is at least `len(nums) - 2` before the last maximum value was removed, indicating that the loop has finished executing due to either `flag` becoming False or `nums` being empty.
    print['NO', 'YES'][flag]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). It checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers in the array is less than 2. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False and stops checking. The function removes the maximum value from the array in each iteration until the array is empty or the flag is False. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True, indicating that all differences were valid, and 'NO' if the flag is False, indicating that at least one difference was not valid. However, the function may not handle the input correctly, as `raw_input` and `print` are used incorrectly, and it lacks proper input validation and processing logic.
