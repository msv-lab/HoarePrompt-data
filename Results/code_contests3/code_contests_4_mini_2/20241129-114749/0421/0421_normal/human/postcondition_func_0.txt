The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of an array, followed by `n` space-separated integers `ai` (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100). It checks if the absolute difference between any two consecutive integers in the array is less than 2. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False and stops checking. The function removes the maximum value from the array in each iteration until the array is empty or the flag is False. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the flag remains True, indicating that all differences were valid, and 'NO' if the flag is False, indicating that at least one difference was not valid. However, the function may not handle the input correctly, as `raw_input` and `print` are used incorrectly, and it lacks proper input validation and processing logic.
