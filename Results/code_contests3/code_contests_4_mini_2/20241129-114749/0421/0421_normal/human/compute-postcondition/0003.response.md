According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. Right before the loop, `flag` is True and `nums` is a map of integers from input, which implies that `nums` should not be empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute, `nums` needs to be a non-empty map (or collection).

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, for the loop to execute the first time `nums` must be a non-empty map of integers from input**
