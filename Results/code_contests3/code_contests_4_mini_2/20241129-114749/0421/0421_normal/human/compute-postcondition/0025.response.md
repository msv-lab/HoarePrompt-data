According to the code, the loop will execute again if the index `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `len(nums)` is greater than 1 since `nums` is a non-empty map of integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**.
