The function `func` accepts an integer `n`, which represents the size of the array, with the constraint that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`. It also accepts `n` space-separated integers `ai`, where each integer satisfies the condition `1 ≤ ai ≤ 100`. After executing the function body, it processes the input values accordingly. However, since no specific output conditions are provided, we cannot detail the exact return value at this time. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` representing the size of the array and `n` integers that are the elements of the array, within the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and n space-separated integers ai (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) representing the elements of the array.**
