According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop iterates over the range created by `len(nums) - 1`. Since `n` is a string input representing the size of the array and is at least "2", we can infer that `len(nums)` must also be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

If the loop executed for the last time with `i`, it implies that `i` has taken a value that is currently less than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1`.

Given that `flag` is still set to False and considering the structure of the loop, we can conclude that the state at the beginning of the next iteration should reflect the incremented index and the condition for `len(nums)`. 

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array that is at least "2", `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, and `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`.**
