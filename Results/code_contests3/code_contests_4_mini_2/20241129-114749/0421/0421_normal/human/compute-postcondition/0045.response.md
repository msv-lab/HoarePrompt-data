According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `nums`. The loop iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 2` (inclusive), meaning it can execute while `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing the size of the array (which is at least "2"), `flag` is False, and `nums` is a non-empty map of integers. 

Since the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. If `i` is currently less than `len(nums) - 2`, then it can be incremented further. 

Thus, if `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, the condition must hold that `i + 1` is still less than `len(nums) - 1`.

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array that is at least "2", `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is incremented by 1 and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 2`.**
