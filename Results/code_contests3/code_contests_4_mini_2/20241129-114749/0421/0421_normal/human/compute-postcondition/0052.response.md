The code attempts to print either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the value of `flag`. Since `flag` is False, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][flag]` will evaluate to `['NO', 'YES'][False]`, which corresponds to the first element of the list, 'NO'. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array; `flag` is False; `nums` is an empty map of integers; `i` is at least `len(nums) - 2`; the output printed is 'NO'.

Output State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array; `flag` is False; `nums` is an empty map of integers; `i` is at least `len(nums) - 2`; the output printed is 'NO'**.
