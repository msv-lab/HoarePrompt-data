Postcondition: ***`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, and `i` is 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
