The value of `flag` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and the absolute difference between the elements `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2.
