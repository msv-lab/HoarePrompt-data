The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `flag` is not defined, but it is explicitly set to `True` now. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a string input representing the size of the array. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True.

Output State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True**
