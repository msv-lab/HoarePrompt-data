Output State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array that is at least "2", `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, and `i` is at least `len(nums) - 2`. If the absolute difference between any two consecutive elements in `nums` is greater than or equal to 2, `flag` is set to False and the loop breaks. If all consecutive elements differ by less than 2, `flag` remains True.**
