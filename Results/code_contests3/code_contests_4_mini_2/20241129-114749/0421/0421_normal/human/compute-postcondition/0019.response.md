To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to assess the conditions for the `while` loop:

1. **Condition Analysis**: The loop will continue to execute as long as both `flag` is `True` and `nums` is not empty.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the last iteration, `flag` could be either `True` or `False`. If it's `False`, the loop cannot execute again regardless of the state of `nums`. If `flag` is `True`, then the next condition to check is whether `nums` is empty or not.

Given that `nums` is mentioned as a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, it implies that at least one element remains in `nums`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, the only state we need to check is the `flag` variable.

- If `flag` is currently `True`, the loop can execute again without any adjustments.
- If `flag` is `False`, then for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `flag` to `True`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `flag` at the end of the last iteration, we need to ensure that it is set to `True` for the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, and `i` is the last index checked before exiting the loop or `len(nums) - 2`**.
