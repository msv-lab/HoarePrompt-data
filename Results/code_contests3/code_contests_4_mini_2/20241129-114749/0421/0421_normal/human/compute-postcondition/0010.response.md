The value of `flag` is assigned to False, but it was already set to False in the initial state. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2.
