According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `flag` and `nums`. The loop will only execute if both `flag` is True and `nums` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `flag` is False, which means the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `flag` must be changed to True. The state of `n` and `nums` does not need to be adjusted because `nums` is already non-empty (as stated). 

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, and `i` is the last index checked before breaking or `len(nums) - 2`**
