The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array that is at least "2", `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop.
