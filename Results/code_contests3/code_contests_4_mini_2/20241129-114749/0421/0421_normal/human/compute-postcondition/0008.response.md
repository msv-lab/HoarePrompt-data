Postcondition: ***`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 0. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
