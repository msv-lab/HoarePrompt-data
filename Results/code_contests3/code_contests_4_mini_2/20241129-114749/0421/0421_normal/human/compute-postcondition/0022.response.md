The variable `flag` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The values of other variables (`n`, `nums`, `i`) remain unaffected in this execution step. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 0**
