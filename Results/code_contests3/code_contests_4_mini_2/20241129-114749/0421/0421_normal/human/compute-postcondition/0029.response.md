According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. 

Since `len(nums)` is greater than 2 (because `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed), the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2, and the program should have at least 3 elements in `nums` (which ensures that `len(nums) - 1` is at least 2).

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is set to False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `len(nums)` must be greater than 2**.
