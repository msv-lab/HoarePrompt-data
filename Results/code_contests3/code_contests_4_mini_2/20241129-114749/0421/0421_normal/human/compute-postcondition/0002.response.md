The code initializes `nums` by mapping the `raw_input().split()` to integers. The variable `n` is a string input representing the size of the array, and `flag` is True. The `raw_input()` function will take an input string which is then split into separate strings based on whitespace, and each of those strings is converted to an integer by the `map(int, ...)` function. However, since the specific input for `raw_input()` is not provided, the exact values of the integers in `nums` cannot be determined.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `nums` is a map of integers created from the input, but we do not have the specific integer values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, `nums` is a map of integers from input**
