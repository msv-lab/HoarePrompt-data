The code snippet `nums.remove(max(nums))` removes the maximum value from the list `nums`. The initial state mentions that `nums` is a non-empty map of integers, which implies that there is at least one integer present. The maximum value is removed, and this action directly affects `nums`. 

Since `flag` is initially set to False and it can only be affected by the condition regarding the absolute difference between consecutive elements, but the code provided does not change `flag`. Thus, the only change in the output state comes from the modification of `nums`.

Output State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array that is at least "2"; `flag` is False; `nums` is the map of integers with the maximum value removed; `i` is at least `len(nums) - 2**
