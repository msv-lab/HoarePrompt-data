According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1, which means `nums` must contain at least 2 elements. 

The variable `i` is set to `len(nums) - 2`, which indicates that the loop will start with `i` being the last index that was checked before the loop. Since the loop uses `xrange(len(nums) - 1)`, it means that `i` will need to be adjusted to start from 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is True, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `len(nums)` must be greater than 1**
