The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array, `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
