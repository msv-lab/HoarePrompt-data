Postcondition: ***`n` is a string input representing the size of the array that is at least "2", `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, and `i` is incremented by 1. If the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop.***
