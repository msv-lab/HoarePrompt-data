The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string input representing the size of the array that must be at least "2", `flag` is False, `nums` is a non-empty map of integers with the maximum value removed, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, and the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to 2, and we break out of the most internal loop.
