According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is less than \( 1 << n \), and `j` is 1. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1.**
