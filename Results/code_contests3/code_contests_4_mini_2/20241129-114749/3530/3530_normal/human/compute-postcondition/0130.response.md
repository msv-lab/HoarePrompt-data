Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is less than \( 1 << n \), `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and \( 1 << j \) is non-zero.***
