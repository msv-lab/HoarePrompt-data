According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` that range from 1 to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will have been incremented, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration would be `n`, the loop will not execute again unless `n` is increased. 

Therefore, the next state must reflect that `i` will be `n + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must remain the same. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated results based on the conditions checked through all possible `mask` values (from 1 to `2^n - 1`), for the loop to execute one more time `i` must be `n + 1`.**
