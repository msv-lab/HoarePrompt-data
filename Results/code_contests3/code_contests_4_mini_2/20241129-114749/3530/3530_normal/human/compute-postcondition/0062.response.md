Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `mask` is less than `2^n`, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
