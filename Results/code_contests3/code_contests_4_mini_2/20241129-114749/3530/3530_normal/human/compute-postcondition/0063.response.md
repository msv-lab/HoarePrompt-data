Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mask` is less than `2^n`, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, considering all `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true for any `j`, `dp[i][mask]` will contain the accumulated values from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modulo `MOD`. If the conditions are not met for all `j`, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.**
