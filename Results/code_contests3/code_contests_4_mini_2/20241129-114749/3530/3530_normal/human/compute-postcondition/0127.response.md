Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative results after processing all valid masks and j values for all `j` in the range [0, n-1]. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j`th bit set for any `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the sum of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` for all valid `j` values. The final result of `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.**
