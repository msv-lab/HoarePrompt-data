Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is at least 2; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1]; `j` is equal to `n - 1` after all iterations; `mask` is 3; `dp[i][mask]` contains the sum of all valid updates based on the conditions described in the loop for each value of `j`, taking modulo `MOD`.**
