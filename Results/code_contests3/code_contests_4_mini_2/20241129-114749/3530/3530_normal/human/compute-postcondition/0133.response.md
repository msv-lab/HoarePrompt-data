Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `mask` is less than \( 1 << n \), and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j`-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
