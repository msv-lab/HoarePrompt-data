According to the code, the for loop iterates over the range defined by `n`. The variable `j` starts at 1 at the end of the previous iteration. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 2.

Additionally, for the loop to execute again, it must be ensured that `n` is greater than 2, as `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `mask` is less than \( 1 << n \), and `j` is 2.**
