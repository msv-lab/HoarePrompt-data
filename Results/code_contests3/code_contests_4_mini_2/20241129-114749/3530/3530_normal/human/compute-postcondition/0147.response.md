The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. This means the result of `dp[i][mask]` will be the remainder when the current value is divided by `MOD`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` are not specified in detail, but their update implies they are affected by the addition from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. Other variables are not affected in this operation.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
