The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the value of `dp[i][mask]` unless it exceeds `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` was influenced by `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, but the current execution affects only `dp[i][mask]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
