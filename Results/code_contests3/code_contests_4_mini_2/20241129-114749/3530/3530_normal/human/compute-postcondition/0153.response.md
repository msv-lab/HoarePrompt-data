According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the index of the current iteration, and it must be noted that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. 

Since `j` will increment by 1 for the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be equal to the next index, which is `j + 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`, which means after the current iteration, `j` should be `n - 1` at maximum.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `mask` is the next value less than \( 1 << n \); for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n` and for the loop to execute again `j` will be `j + 1`.**
