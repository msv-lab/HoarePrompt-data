Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is at least 2, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the bit corresponding to `j` set (which is true since `mask & 1 << j`), then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
