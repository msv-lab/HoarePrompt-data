Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated result based on the conditions checked, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time, `mask` is 2, and the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero.***
