Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is at least 2; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1]; `j` is equal to `n` after all iterations; `mask` is 3; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`; otherwise, other variables remain unchanged.***
