According to the code, the loop variable `j` determines how many times the loop will execute. Given that `j` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute again unless `j` is reset. Since `j` is increased by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be equal to `n`, and we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n` to allow for another iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be reset to `0`. The condition for the loop to continue executing (for the next iteration) must be satisfied by ensuring `j` is less than `n`. 

Since `mask` is currently `3`, it remains unchanged, and we assume the other variables stay the same.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is at least 2; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1]; `j` is 0 for the loop to execute a first time; `mask` is 3.**
