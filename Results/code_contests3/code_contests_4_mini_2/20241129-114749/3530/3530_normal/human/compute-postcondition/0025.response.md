According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 1, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
