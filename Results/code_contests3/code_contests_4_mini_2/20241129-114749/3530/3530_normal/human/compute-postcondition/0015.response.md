According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `2^n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2^n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= N <= 21`, `2^n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. 

Thus, the updated state must reflect that `i` is now 2, and the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `2^n`, which is still valid because `i` (2) is less than `2^n` for `n` values ranging from 1 to 21.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a third time `i` must be less than 2^n.**
