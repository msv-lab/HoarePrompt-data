The `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` line takes user input, splits it into separate strings, converts each string to an integer, and appends the resulting integers as a new item to the list `a`. The previous value of `a` is known to be a map object containing integers from user input, and it gets updated to include the new integers from the current user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` now contains the original integers plus the newly added integers from the most recent input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains the original map object of integers from user input, now updated with new integers; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `_` is 2.**
