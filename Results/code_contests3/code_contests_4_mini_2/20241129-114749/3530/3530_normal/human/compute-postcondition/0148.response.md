Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `mask` is the next value less than \( 1 << n \). If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
