Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is `n`, `mask` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
