The code updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The variable `mask` is currently 3, and `j` is 1, which means that `1 << j` evaluates to `2`. Therefore, `mask ^ 1 << j` calculates to `3 ^ 2`, which results in `1`. The previous value of `dp[i-1][1]` is added to `dp[i][3]`.

Since no specific values for `dp[i][3]` or `dp[i-1][1]` are provided, we cannot determine the exact values after the operation. However, we can state that `dp[i][3]` will have its value increased by the value contained in `dp[i-1][1]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][1]` to it, where `mask` is 3 and `j` is 1.**
