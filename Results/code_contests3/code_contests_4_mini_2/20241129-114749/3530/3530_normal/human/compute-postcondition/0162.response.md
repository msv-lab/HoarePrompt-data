Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` representing the compatibility between `N` men and `N` women. It computes the number of ways to pair each man with a woman such that only compatible pairs (indicated by `1` in the list) are considered. The result is returned as the count of valid pairings modulo `1000000007`. The function handles all valid combinations of pairings and ensures that the compatibility data is processed correctly to yield the final count. **
