Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][1]`, `j` is 0, `mask` is 2, and `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1; `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the range of `MOD`.**
