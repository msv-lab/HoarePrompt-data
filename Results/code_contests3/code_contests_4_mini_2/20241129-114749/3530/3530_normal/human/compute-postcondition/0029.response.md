According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes `2`. Also, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j`, meaning `n` must be greater than `2`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 2, and `mask` is 1**
