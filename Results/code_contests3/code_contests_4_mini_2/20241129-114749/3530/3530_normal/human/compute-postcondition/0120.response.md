The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. This implies that for each valid `i` and `mask`, the cumulative result for `dp[i][mask]` is being incremented based on a previously computed result from `dp[i - 1]`. 

The value of `mask` is altered by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `1 << j`, which means that the `j`-th bit of `mask` is toggled. 

Since `j` is incremented to its current value plus 1, it is essential that this code is part of a loop that continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. The previous values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not defined in the initial state, but we know they are used for updating the cumulative results.

Therefore, the output state reflects the update in `dp[i][mask]` without specific numerical values since they are not provided in the initial state, but we recognize that the value has been updated based on the previous state.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it.**
