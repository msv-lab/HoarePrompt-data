The function `func` accepts a parameter `N`, which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 21, and a parameter `a`, which is a 2D list of integers that represents the compatibility between `N` men and `N` women, where each element in the list is either 0 or 1. The function processes these inputs to determine compatibility and returns a result based on them. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list of integers a, representing compatibility between N men and N women, and returns a result based on this compatibility.**
