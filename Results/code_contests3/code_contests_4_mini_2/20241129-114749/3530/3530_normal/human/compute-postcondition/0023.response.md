The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. This means that the value of `dp[i][mask]` is now constrained to be within the bounds defined by `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variable `dp[i][mask]` are not specified, but they will be altered by this operation. The other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the bounds of `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be within the bounds of `MOD`**
