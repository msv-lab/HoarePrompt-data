The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is being updated in the context of the operation. The other variables (`i`, `mask`, and `j`) are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo `MOD`, where `mask` is 3 and `j` is 1, but the specific values of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` are not given.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo `MOD`, where `mask` is 3 and `j` is 1.**
