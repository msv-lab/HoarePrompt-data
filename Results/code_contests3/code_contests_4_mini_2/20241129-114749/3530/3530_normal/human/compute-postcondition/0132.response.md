The operation modifies `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation does not change the previously calculated values in the array `dp`, but it ensures that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`, and the previous values of the variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`**
