Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer; `dp[n][mask]` contains the cumulative results after processing all valid masks and j values for all `j` in the range [0, n-1], based on the conditions specified in the loop, with each value taken modulo `MOD`.**
