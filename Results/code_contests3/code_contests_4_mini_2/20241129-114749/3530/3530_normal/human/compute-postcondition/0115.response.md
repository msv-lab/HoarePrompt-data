Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative results after processing all valid masks and j values, `mask` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 while the `mask` has the bit at position `j` set (i.e., `mask & 1 << j` is true).***
