The operation updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. Here, `mask` is 3, which in binary is `11`, and `j` is equal to `n`. The bitwise operation `mask ^ (1 << j)` will toggle the j-th bit of `mask`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is at least 2, this means the j-th bit corresponds to the 2^n position, which is out of the current range of bits represented by `mask`. Therefore, `mask ^ (1 << j)` will not affect the first two bits of `mask`.

The previous values indicate that:
- `dp[i][mask]` will be updated.
- `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` is being referenced but its specific value is not provided in the initial state.

Hence, the value of `dp[i][mask]` is increased by the value at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the update to `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to include `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`, while other variables remain unchanged.**
