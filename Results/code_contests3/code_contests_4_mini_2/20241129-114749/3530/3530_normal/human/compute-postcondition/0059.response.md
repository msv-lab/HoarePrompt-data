According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the loop can execute for a second time. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be increased by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `mask` is less than `2^n`, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
