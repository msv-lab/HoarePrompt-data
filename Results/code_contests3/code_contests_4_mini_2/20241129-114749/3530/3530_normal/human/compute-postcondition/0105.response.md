Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is at least 2, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 0 for the loop to execute a first time, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & 1 << `j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][3]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]` and taking modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[i][3]`.***
