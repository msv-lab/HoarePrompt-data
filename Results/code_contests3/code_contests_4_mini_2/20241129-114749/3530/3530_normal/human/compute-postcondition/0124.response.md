The line of code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. This operation involves a bitwise XOR operation on `mask` with `1 << j`, which means that the j-th bit of `mask` is being toggled. The specific values of `dp`, `mask`, `i`, and `j` are not provided, but we know that this operation will affect the `dp` array at the specified indices based on the current values of `i`, `mask`, and `j`.

Since `N`, `a`, `MOD`, `n`, and `j` are previously defined, we can state that:
- `dp[i][mask]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
- The exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` depend on the current state of the program and cannot be determined without further context.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `dp` array while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `j + 1`; `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
