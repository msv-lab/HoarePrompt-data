The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The specific values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not given, but we know that `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and that the bitwise AND of `mask` and \( 1 << j \) is non-zero, indicating that the j-th bit in `mask` is set.

Since `dp[i][mask]` is being updated, we can infer that the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` will influence the outcome. However, we do not have the specific values for the `dp` array, so we can only state that the value will change based on the previous state.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `dp[i][mask]`, acknowledging that it now includes the contribution from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, where `mask` and `j` are defined and `a[i - 1][j]` is 1.**
