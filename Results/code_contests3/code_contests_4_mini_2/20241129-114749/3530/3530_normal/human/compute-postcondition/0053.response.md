The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but the operation will ensure that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the bounds defined by `MOD`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
