According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `(1 << n) - 1`, where `1 << n` is equal to `2^n`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than `0`, the loop will execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, so for the loop to execute for the first time, `i` should be set to `0`, which is the starting value of the range. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to include the initialization of `i` and confirm that `n` is greater than `0`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp` is a list with dimensions (n + 1) x (2^n) initialized to zeros, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time.**
