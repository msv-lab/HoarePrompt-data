Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1]. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` & (1 << `j`) evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][1]`, ensuring that `dp[i][mask]` remains within the range of `MOD`.***
