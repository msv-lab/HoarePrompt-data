Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `j` is `j_current + 1` with `j < n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
