According to the code, the loop is dependent on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, which it is since it is specified as a positive integer greater than 0. The variable `j` will start at 0 and will increment with each iteration until it reaches `n`. 

Before the loop starts, `mask` must also be less than `2^n` for the loop to execute. Therefore, the current state of `mask` should be less than `2^n`. 

Given that `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, the possible values of `n` will also be valid in this range. 

To summarize, the loop can execute if `j` is initialized to 0, and `mask` is set to a value less than `2^n` (where `n` is as defined). 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mask` is less than `2^n`, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**.
