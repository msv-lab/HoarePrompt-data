According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which iterates through the range of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the value of `j` for the next iteration will be `j + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, and `j` is `j + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `n` must be greater than `j + 1**
