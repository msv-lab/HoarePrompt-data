According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `_`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains the new map object of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `_` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
