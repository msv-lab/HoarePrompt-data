Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 0, and the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 while the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero (indicating that the jth bit of mask is set).***
