The variable `a` is assigned an empty list, which means it has been initialized but currently contains no elements. The values of the other variables, `N`, `MOD`, and `n`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.**
