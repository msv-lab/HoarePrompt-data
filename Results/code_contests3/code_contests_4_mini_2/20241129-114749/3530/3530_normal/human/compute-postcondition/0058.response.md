Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `mask` is less than `2^n`, and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 2]` to it, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
