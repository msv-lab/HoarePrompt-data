Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `mask` is less than \( 1 << n \); `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.**
