Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the `j`-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and is taken modulo `MOD`.***
