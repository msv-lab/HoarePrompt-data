Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mask` is less than `2^n`, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. There are no changes made to the state of the program if the condition is false.***
