Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `mask` is the next value less than \( 1 << n \); if `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`.***
