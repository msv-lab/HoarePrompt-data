Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer; `mask` is less than \( 1 << n \); `j` is `n - 1`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the conditions given, resulting in its final value which is the sum of all valid transitions from `dp[i - 1][...]` as specified by the bits set in `mask`.**
