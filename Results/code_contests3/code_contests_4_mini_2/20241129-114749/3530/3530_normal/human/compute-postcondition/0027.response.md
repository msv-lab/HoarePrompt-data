The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is influenced by the addition of `dp[i - 1][3]` to it. The variables `mask` and `j` are defined, with `mask` being 1 and `j` being 1, but they do not affect the operation since they are not directly involved in the modulo operation.

Therefore, the state of `dp[i][mask]` is now the remainder of its previous value after the addition of `dp[i - 1][3]`. Other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value modulo `MOD`**
