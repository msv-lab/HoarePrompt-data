The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. During each iteration, it appends a new map object of integers from the user input to the list `a`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute exactly `n` times, and `a` will end up containing `n` map objects of integers.

After all iterations have finished, `a` will contain `n` map objects, each representing the integers inputted by the user during each iteration. The values of `N`, `MOD`, and `n` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop are completed is:

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
