The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user as a string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and appends the resulting map object to the list `a`. The previous state indicates that `a` is an empty list, and `N` is a positive integer, but we do not have specific values for the input or the contents of `a` since they depend on the user's input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` now contains a new map object with integers derived from the user input.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains the new map object of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer greater than 0; `_` is 0.**
