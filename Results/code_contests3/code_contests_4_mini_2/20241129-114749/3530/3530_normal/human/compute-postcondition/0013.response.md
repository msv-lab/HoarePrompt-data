According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, \(1 << n\) will be greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.

To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than \(2^n\). Given that `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 1 and `N` must still be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\).

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than 2^n.**
