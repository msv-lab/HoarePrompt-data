According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value which is less than `n - 1`, since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increments by 1 on each iteration. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is the next integer in the range [0, n - 1]**
