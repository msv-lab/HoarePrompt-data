According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask`. The loop will execute as long as `mask` is less than `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is at least 1 and less than `2^n` (since it starts at 1 and the loop runs while mask is less than `2^n`). 

To prepare for the next iteration, `mask` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `mask` must be less than `2^n`. Since `mask` will be increased to the next integer, it will be `mask + 1`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `mask` will be `mask + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to execute again will be that `mask` must be less than `2^n`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], for the loop to execute again `mask` must be less than `2^n`, and `mask` is incremented to `mask + 1`.**
