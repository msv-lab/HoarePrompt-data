The state of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The operations involve bit manipulation with `mask` and `j`. Given that `mask` is 1 and `j` is 1, we calculate `mask ^ 1 << j`, which results in `1 ^ 2 = 3`. 

Thus, we are adding the value from `dp[i - 1][3]` to `dp[i][1]`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that a value has been updated in the `dp` array.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][3]` to it, where `mask` is 1 and `j` is 1.**
