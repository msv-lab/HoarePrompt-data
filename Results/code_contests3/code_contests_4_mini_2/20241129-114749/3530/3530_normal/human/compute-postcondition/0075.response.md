Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], and `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`. If the condition does not hold, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
