According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The range of the loop is defined by `n`, which is a positive integer. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, `j` is initialized to `n - 1`, which means it will be decremented in the loop. However, since the loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`, the starting value of `j` is not relevant for the loop execution itself. Instead, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than 0.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `j` will take values from `0` to `n - 1` during the iterations.

As such, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is within the defined constraints, and we can note that `j` will start at `0` on the first iteration.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `mask` is the next value less than \( 1 << n \), `j` is 0**
