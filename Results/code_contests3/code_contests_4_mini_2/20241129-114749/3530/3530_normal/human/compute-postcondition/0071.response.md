Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the jth bit of `mask` is set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
