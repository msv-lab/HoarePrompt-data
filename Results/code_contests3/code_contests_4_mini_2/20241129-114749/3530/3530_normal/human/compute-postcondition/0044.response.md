According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at its current value, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. 

If the loop executes again, `j` will be equal to the next integer in the range, specifically `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we do not have the exact value of `j`, but we know it is currently a valid index within the range, which means it must satisfy `0 <= j < n`. 

Thus, if we denote the current value of `j` as `j_current`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must now be `j_current + 1`. 

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than `n` and `j` will be `j_current + 1`.**
