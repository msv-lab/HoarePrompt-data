Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `dp[i][mask]` contains the cumulative results after processing all valid masks and j values. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the `j`th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with `dp[n][0]` and taken modulo `MOD`.***
