Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is a positive integer; `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1]; `j` is `n`; `mask` is 2; the loop cannot execute again because `j` is not less than `n`. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask` & 1 << j, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.***
