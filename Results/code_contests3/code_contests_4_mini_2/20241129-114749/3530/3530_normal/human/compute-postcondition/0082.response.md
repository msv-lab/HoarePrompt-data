According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is a positive integer. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `j = 0` up to `j = n - 1`. Since `j` is currently `n - 1`, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is outside the current range of the loop. 

Also, the variable `mask` is mentioned, where it must be 2 for the loop to execute a second time, indicating that the state may need to reflect this requirement.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is n-1, for the loop to execute a second time `mask` is 2, and `j` is now n (for the loop to execute again).**
