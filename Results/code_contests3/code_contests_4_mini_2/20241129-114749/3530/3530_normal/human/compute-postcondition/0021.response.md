Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains `n` map objects of integers from user input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range [0, 2^n - 1], `j` is 0, `mask` is 1, `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 shifted left by `j` is non-zero.***
