The value of `dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. Since `dp[0][0]` is already 1 and now `dp[0][i]` (where `i` is 1) is also set to 1, this does not change the value of `dp[0][0]`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is 1, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1**
