According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. Currently, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. 

Since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute a second time as long as `j` remains less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3 to allow `j` to be equal to 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[1][3]` may be updated to `dp[1][3] % MOD`.**
