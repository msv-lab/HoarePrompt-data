The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. However, since the value of `dp[1][3]` remains unchanged, we cannot determine the exact value of `dp[i][mask]`, as the previous states of `dp[i][mask]` are not provided. The other variables `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `mask` is 3; `j` is 2; `dp[1][3]` remains unchanged.**
