According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Given the conditions that `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, we also have that `n` is valid, which implies that `n` should be at least 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be incremented in each iteration starting from 1. Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1**
