According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute at least 3 times. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `mask` is 2, which seem to hold their values for the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute the first time, `j` must be initialized to 0. Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are the initialization of `j` to 0 while ensuring that `n` is at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
