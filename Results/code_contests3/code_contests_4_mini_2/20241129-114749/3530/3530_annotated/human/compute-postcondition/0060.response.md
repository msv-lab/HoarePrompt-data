To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the components involved:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21.
   - `n` is at least 3.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mask` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Conditions**:
   - We have the condition `if a[i - 1][j] equals 1 and mask bitwise AND with 1 << j is true`. 
   - Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, it implies we are checking `a[0][2]`.
   - The `mask` is 3, which in binary is `11`. The operation `1 << j` where `j` is 2 results in `4` (binary `100`). 
   - The bitwise AND operation `mask & (1 << j)` checks if the 2nd bit (third position in binary) is set in `mask`. Since `mask` is `3` (`11` in binary) and `4` is `0b100`, `mask & (1 << j)` will be `0` (because `3 & 4 = 0`).

3. **Effect of the Code**:
   - Since `mask & (1 << j)` evaluates to false (0), the body of the if statement does not execute, meaning no updates to `dp[1][3]` will occur.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The state of `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged because the condition for updating it was not satisfied. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`) also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 1; `mask` is 3; `j` is 2; `dp[1][3]` remains unchanged.**
