Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions N x N. It calculates a value stored in `dp[N][(1 << N) - 1]`, which represents the count of specific configurations based on the input matrix. Finally, it prints this value. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result, which may lead to confusion regarding its output.**
