Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid and at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` is bitwise ANDed with `1 << j`, then `dp[1][1]` is updated with the value of `dp[0][3]` modulo `MOD`.***
