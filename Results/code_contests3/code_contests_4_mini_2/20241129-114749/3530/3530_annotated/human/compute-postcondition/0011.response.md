According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). Since `n` is the number of lines read from input and can vary based on the input provided, as long as `n` is between 1 and 21, \(2^n\) will yield a value of at least 2 (when \(n = 1\)) and at most 2097152 (when \(n = 21\)). 

This means that as long as `n` is valid (between 1 and 21), the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, the value of `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration.

To summarize, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `n` is valid and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is 0**
