Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[2][2]` is updated by adding `dp[1][1]` to it, and `dp[2][2]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[2][2]`.***
