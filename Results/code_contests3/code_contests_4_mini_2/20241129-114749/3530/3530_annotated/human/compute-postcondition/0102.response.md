According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop continues to execute while `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, which makes `j` equal to 1. Additionally, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to be valid.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2.**
