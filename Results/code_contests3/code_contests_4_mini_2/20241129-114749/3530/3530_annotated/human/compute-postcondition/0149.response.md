According to the code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, which is at least 3. The variable `j` is currently 0, meaning the loop has executed once for the first value of `j`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` should be 1. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`, which is at least 3, so `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1, and if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`.**
