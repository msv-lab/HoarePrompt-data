Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `mask` is 2; and `mask` is less than 2^n. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there are no updates to `dp[i][mask]`.***
