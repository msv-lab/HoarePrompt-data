According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. This means that the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`.

After the current iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
