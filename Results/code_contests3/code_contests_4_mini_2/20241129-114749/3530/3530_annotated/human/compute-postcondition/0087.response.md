According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, the state needs to reflect that `j` is now 1. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1.**
