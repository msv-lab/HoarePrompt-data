Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, and `dp[2][mask]` is updated based on the conditions evaluated for all values of `j` from 0 to `n-1`, taking into account `a[i - 1][j]` and `mask & 1 << j`. Specifically, `dp[2][2]` will contain the sum of all valid `dp[1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values modulo `MOD` for all relevant `j` where the conditions hold true.**
