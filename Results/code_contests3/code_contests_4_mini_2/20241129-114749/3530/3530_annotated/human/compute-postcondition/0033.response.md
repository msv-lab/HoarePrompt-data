Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is valid and at least 1; `i` is 1; `mask` is 1; `dp[1][1]` is updated by the sum of relevant `dp[0][mask ^ 1 << j]` values for all valid `j` where `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, with all updates taken modulo `MOD`.**
