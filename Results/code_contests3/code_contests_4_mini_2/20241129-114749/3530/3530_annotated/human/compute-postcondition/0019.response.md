According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for values of `mask` ranging from 1 to \(2^n - 1\) (since \(1 << n\) is equivalent to \(2^n\)). For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1, which is already stated. 

Given that `i` is initialized to 1, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop since `mask` is the variable being iterated over in the loop. The critical condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be at least 1, and `mask` will start from 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid and at least 1, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1**
