According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `n` is valid and at least 2. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2, which it is.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid and at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 2.**
