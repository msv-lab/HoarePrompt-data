The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be the remainder of the division of `dp[i][mask]` by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, but we know that it has been updated with some value from `dp[1][0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the information about the current state of `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]`, while indicating that `dp[i][mask]` has been modified.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
