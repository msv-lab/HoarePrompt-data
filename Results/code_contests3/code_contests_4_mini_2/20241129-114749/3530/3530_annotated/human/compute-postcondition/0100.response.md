The line of code modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the operation performed on `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated with modulo `MOD`.**
