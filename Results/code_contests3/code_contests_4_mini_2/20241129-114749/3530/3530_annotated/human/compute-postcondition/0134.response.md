According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated modulo `MOD` for the loop to execute a second time.**
