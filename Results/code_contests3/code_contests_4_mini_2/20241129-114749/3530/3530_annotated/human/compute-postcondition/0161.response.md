The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 21\), and `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions \(N \times N\). 

The function does not specify output cases, so we can summarize the output based on the provided information. However, since there are no explicit output cases defined in the provided description, we cannot detail specific return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `N` and a 2D list `a`, which is structured as an \(N \times N\) matrix of 0s and 1s, but the specific output is not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions N x N. The specific return value is not defined.**
