Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` has iterated through the range of `n`, and if for any `j`, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` holds true, then `dp[i][mask]` is the sum of all valid `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` values taken modulo `MOD`.**
