According to the code, the loop iterates over a range based on the value of `n`. The loop will execute from `mask = 1` to `mask = (1 << n) - 1`. The condition for the loop to execute a third time means that the loop must have executed at least twice already, which requires `n` to be at least 3 (since `1 << 3` equals 8, leading to 7 valid iterations).

Currently, we have:
- `N` is between 1 and 21,
- `n` is at least 2 (which needs to be increased to at least 3 for the loop to execute a third time),
- `i` is 3.

To ensure the loop can execute a third time, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3. Additionally, since the loop variable `mask` will take on values starting from 1, the initial value of `mask` will be 1 on the first iteration.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 3 and that `mask` starts from 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `mask` is 1 on the first iteration**
