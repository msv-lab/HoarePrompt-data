According to the code, the loop iterates over `mask` starting from 1 and goes up to `1 << n` (which is `2^n`). Since `mask` is currently 1, it can execute again if `mask` is less than `2^n`. Given that `n` is valid and at least 1, `2^n` is at least 2. 

At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` should be incremented by 1. Thus, `mask` will become 2. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid and at least 1, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `mask` must be less than 2^n**
