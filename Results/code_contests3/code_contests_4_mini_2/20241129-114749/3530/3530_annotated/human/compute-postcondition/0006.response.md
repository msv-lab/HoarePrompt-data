The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts those strings into integers, and appends the resulting integers as a list to the existing list `a`. The previous values of `N`, `MOD`, and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect that `a` now contains additional integers from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` now contains a new list of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is 3, and `a` has been extended with the integers from input.**
