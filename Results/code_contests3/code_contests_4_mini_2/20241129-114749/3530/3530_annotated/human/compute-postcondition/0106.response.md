According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it will allow the loop to execute for the third time.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a third time.**
