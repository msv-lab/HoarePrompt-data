The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The value of `i` is 3 and `mask` is 1, meaning that `dp[3][1]` is assigned the result of `dp[3][1] % MOD`. The values of the other variables (`N`, `n`, `j`) and the previous state of `dp[3][1]` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; `dp[3][1]` is updated to `dp[3][1] % MOD`.**
