The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and computing the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables include `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD`. 

Since `dp[i][mask]` is updated but the specific previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided in the initial state, we can only state that it is modified. The other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and `a[i - 1][j]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0, `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated modulo `MOD`.**
