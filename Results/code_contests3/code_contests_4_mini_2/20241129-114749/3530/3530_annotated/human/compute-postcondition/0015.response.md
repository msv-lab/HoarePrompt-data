According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `1 << n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is valid, meaning it could range from 1 to 21. The value of `1 << n` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, which means the loop will execute while `i` is less than `2^n`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. For that to happen, `1 << n` must be greater than 2, which implies that `n` must be at least 2 (since `1 << 1` equals 2). 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
