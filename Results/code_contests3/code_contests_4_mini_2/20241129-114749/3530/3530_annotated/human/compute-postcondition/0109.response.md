Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the value of `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
