According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`, which determines how many iterations the loop will perform. Given that `n` is at least 3, the loop will execute at least 3 times. The variable `j` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n - 1`. Since `i` is 3, it indicates the current index in array `a`, and `mask` is set to 3, which will influence the condition involving `mask & 1 << j`.

For the loop to execute, the current state must reflect the initialization of `j` at its starting point. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` starts at 0. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
