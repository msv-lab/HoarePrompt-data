According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, which is at least 2, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` would have been 0 in the first iteration. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 1.

After the first iteration, `j` would be 1, and since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again when `j` is 1. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1**
