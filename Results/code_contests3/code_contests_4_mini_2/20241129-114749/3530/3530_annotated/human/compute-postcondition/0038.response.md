Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `mask` is 2; `mask` is less than 2^n; `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1; the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` is non-zero; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`; `dp[i][mask]` is now taken modulo `MOD`.**
