According to the code, the loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. This means for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2.

For the loop to execute a second time, `n` must still be at least 3, and since `j` is now 2, there are no additional conditions that need to be modified.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, and `j` is 2.**
