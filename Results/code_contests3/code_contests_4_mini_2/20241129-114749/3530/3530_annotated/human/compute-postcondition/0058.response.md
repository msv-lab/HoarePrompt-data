Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[1][3]` is updated to `dp[1][3] % MOD`. If the condition is not satisfied, no changes are made to `dp[1][3]`.***
