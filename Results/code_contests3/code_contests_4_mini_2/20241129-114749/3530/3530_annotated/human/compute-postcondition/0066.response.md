According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for every value of `mask` from 1 to (1 << n) - 1, which implies that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Since `n` is already stated to be at least 2, the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `mask` will take its first value of 1, and `i` is currently set to 2, which does not affect the execution of the loop itself but may be relevant for the loop body. 

Therefore, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes for the first time are that `mask` is initialized to 1, and `n` is at least 2, which is already satisfied. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1 (for the loop to execute the first time)**
