The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This operation does not affect other variables but changes the value of `dp[i][mask]` to be within the range defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
