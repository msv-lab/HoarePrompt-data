According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mask` and `n`. The loop can execute while `mask` is less than `1 << n`, which represents the range from 1 to \(2^n - 1\). At the end of the last iteration, `mask` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `mask` needs to be increased to the next value, which is 3. Additionally, since `n` is at least 1, it is still valid for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 1; `i` is 1; `mask` is 3; for the loop to execute again, `mask` must be less than 1 << n (which is at least 4 if n is 2).**
