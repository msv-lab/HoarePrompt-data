The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but the operation ensures that it is reduced to a value within the range of `MOD`. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.
