According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 0. Given that `n` is at least 3, the loop can indeed execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1. Since `n` is at least 3, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute a second time.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `j` is 1.**
