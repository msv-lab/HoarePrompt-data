To analyze the impact of the code snippet:

1. The operation `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` modifies the value at `dp[i][mask]` by adding to it the value found at `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.
2. The values of `i`, `mask`, and `j` are provided:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `mask` is 2.
   - `j` is 2.
3. The operation involves bit manipulation where `1 << j` computes `2^j`, which is `4` when `j` is `2`. Thus, `mask ^ 1 << j` computes `mask ^ 4`.
4. The value of `mask` is `2` (which is `10` in binary), and `4` (which is `100` in binary) is `xor` with `mask`:
   - `2 (10 in binary) ^ 4 (100 in binary)` results in `6 (110 in binary)`.
5. The affected values are `dp[3][2]` and `dp[2][6]`, but we do not have the specific values of these `dp` entries, so we cannot compute an exact numerical outcome.

Given that we cannot determine the exact values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, we can only express the change in the state of the program.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2; `dp[3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[2][6]`.**
