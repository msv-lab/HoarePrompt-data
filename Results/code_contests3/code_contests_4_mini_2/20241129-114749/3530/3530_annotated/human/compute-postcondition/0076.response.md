According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. 

Since `j` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1 to 2. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`, so it must hold that `n` is greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 1, `j` is 2**
