The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when `dp[i][mask]` is divided by `MOD`. The values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` do not affect this operation directly, but the value of `dp[i][mask]` will change.

Assuming `dp[i][mask]` contains some integer value before this operation, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` will be `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid and at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` must be 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid and at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 1, `j` must be 2, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD.**
