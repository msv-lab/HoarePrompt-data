According to the code, the for loop iterates from 1 to n (inclusive). The current state indicates that `i` is 1 at the end of the last iteration, meaning the loop has executed once with `i` equal to 1. 

To execute the loop again, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2 after the next iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`, which is valid and at least 1. 

Since `N` is between 1 and 21 and `n` is valid, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 2, and `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21; `n` is valid and at least 2; `i` is 2; `mask` takes values from 1 to (1 << n) - 1; `dp[1][mask]` is updated based on the conditions met during the iterations for all valid masks.**
