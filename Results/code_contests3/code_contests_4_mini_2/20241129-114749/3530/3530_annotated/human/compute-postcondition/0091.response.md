According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the range `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last value it took before the loop ends, which is `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `n`, and the loop will need to check if it can execute one more time, which means it must have a condition on `j` being less than `n`.

State: **`a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` bitwise AND `1 << j` is true for j = n, for the loop to execute one more time, n must be greater than n**.
