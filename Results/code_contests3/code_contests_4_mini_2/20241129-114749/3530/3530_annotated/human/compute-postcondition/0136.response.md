The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, but it is being modified. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated by applying modulo `MOD`.**
