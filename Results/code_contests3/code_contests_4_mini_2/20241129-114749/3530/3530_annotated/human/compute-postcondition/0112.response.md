According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be at least 3**
