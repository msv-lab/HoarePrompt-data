The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder when divided by `MOD`. The previous state of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by this operation, but the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided. Therefore, we can only indicate that `dp[i][mask]` has been modified, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is at least 2; `i` is 1; `mask` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking modulo `MOD`.**
