The statement `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, but it is modified based on its current value. Other variables (`N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables along with the updated state of `dp[i][mask]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated as `dp[i][mask] %= MOD`.**
