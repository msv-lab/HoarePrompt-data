The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. To evaluate `mask ^ 1 << j`, we first calculate `1 << j`, which is `1 << 1` resulting in `2`. Then, `mask ^ 2` becomes `2 ^ 2`, which equals `0`. Therefore, the operation modifies `dp[2][2]` by adding the value of `dp[1][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1, and `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][0]**.
