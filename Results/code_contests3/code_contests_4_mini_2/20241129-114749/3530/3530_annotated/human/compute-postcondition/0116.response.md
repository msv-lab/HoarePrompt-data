The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]` to it. The variables affected are `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ (1 << j)]`. 

1. The initial state specifies that `mask` is 1 when `j` is 0, meaning that initially, `mask` evaluates to `1` (binary `01`).
2. The operation `mask ^ (1 << j)` when `j` is 0 results in `1 ^ 1`, which is `0`. Therefore, `dp[i - 1][0]` will be added to `dp[i][1]`.
3. The value of `dp[i][mask]` (which is `dp[i][1]`) will be updated by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Since the exact values of `dp[i][1]` and `dp[i - 1][0]` are not provided, we cannot specify their numerical values, but we know that `dp[i][1]` is being modified based on `dp[i - 1][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][0]` to it, where `mask` is 1 when `j` is 0.**
