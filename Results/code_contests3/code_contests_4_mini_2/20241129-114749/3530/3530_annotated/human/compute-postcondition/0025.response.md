According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, continuing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, so it has completed the first iteration of the loop where `j` was 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `n` is valid and at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `n` is valid and at least 2; `i` is 1; `mask` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be 1.**
