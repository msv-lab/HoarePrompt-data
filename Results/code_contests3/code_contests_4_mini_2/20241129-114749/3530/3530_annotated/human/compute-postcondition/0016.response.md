`dp[0][i]` is assigned the value 1. The variable `i` is currently 2, so `dp[0][2]` will be set to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `dp[0][2]` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is 2, `dp[0][0]` is 1, `dp[0][1]` is 1, `dp[0][2]` is 1**
