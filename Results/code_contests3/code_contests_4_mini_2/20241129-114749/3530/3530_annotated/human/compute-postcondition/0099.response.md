The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

Let's analyze the variables:
- `i` is 2.
- `mask` is 3.
- `j` is 0.
- The value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the condition `mask & 1 << j` is true, which means that the bit corresponding to `j` in `mask` is set (since `3 & 1` is true).

This indicates that `1 << j` equals `1` (since `j` is 0), and `mask ^ 1 << j` computes as `3 ^ 1`, which results in `2`. 

Thus, we are updating `dp[2][3]` by adding the value of `dp[1][2]` to it.

The output state is determined by the updated value of `dp[2][3]` and the unchanged values of `N`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, `j`, and the value at `a[i - 1][j]`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is 3, `j` is 0, the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[1][2]` to it.**
