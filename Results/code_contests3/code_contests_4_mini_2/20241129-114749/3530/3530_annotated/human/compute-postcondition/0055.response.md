According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` will be 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `mask` is 3, `j` is 1**
