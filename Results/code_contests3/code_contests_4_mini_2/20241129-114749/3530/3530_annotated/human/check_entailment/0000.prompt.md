You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There are N men and N women, both numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.

For each i, j (1 \leq i, j \leq N), the compatibility of Man i and Woman j is given as an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, Man i and Woman j are compatible; if a_{i, j} = 0, they are not.

Taro is trying to make N pairs, each consisting of a man and a woman who are compatible. Here, each man and each woman must belong to exactly one pair.

Find the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq N \leq 21
* a_{i, j} is 0 or 1.

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


N
a_{1, 1} \ldots a_{1, N}
:
a_{N, 1} \ldots a_{N, N}


Output

Print the number of ways in which Taro can make N pairs, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 21, and a is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions N x N.
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    n = input()
    a = []
    for _ in range(n):
        a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` is a 2D list containing `n` lists of integers from input, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the number of lines read from input.
    dp = [([0] * (1 << n)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1 << n):
        dp[0][i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `dp[0][i]` is 1 for all `i` in the range from 0 to (1 << n) - 1.
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
            for j in range(n):
                if a[i - 1][j] == 1 and mask & 1 << j:
                    dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]
                    dp[i][mask] %= MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `n` is valid, `i` is `n`, `mask` is 2^n - 1, and `dp[n][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions evaluated during all iterations of `i`, `mask`, and `j`.
    print(dp[n][(1 << n) - 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `N` (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0 or 1) with dimensions N x N. It calculates a value stored in `dp[N][(1 << N) - 1]`, which represents the count of specific configurations based on the input matrix. Finally, it prints this value. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result, which may lead to confusion regarding its output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
