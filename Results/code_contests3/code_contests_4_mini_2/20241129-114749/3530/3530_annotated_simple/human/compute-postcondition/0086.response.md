Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `mask` is the next value. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` includes the bit at position `j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no updates are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
