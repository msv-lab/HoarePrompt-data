Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` & 1 << `j` evaluates to true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated with the value from `dp[i - 1][7]` and `dp[i][mask]` is now modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[i][mask]`.***
