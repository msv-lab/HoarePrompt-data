According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and since `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time for `j = 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 1.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `mask` is less than \(2^n\), `j` is 1.**
