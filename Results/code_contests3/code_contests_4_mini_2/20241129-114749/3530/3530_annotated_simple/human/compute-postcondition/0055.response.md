According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is at least 1, which means the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be increased by 1, making it 1. Since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `mask` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
