Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `mask` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. If these conditions are not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
