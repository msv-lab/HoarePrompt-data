Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 0. If `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and `mask & 1 << j` evaluates to true, then `dp[3][2]` is updated by taking `dp[3][2]` modulo `MOD`, while `dp[2][3]` remains unaffected.***
