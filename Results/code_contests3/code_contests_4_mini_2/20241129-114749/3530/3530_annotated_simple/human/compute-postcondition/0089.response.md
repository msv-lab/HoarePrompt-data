The expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and computing the remainder when divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect any other variables. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact value after the operation, only that it is now constrained by `MOD`. 

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
