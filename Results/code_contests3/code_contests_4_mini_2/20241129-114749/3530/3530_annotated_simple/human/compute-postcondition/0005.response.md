According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. Since the loop variable `_` increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

Assuming the loop has executed `N-1` times, the next value of `_` will be `N`, which means for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than the current value of _ (which is N-1)**
