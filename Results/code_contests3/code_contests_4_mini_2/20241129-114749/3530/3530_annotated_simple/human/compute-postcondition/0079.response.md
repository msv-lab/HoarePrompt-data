Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, and `dp[i][mask]` is reduced modulo `MOD`.***
