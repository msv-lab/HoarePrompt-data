According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, the loop will execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, and `i` is set to 2. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` should start at 0, which is the first value in the range of `n`. The other states do not need to be modified for the loop to execute.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
