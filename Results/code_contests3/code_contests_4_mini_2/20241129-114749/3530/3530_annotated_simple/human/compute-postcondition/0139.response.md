The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. Here, `i` is 3 and `mask` is 2, so `mask ^ 1 << j` evaluates to `2 ^ 1 << 2`. The value `1 << 2` equals 4, and `2 ^ 4` results in 6. Therefore, the expression updates `dp[3][2]` by adding the value of `dp[2][6]` to it. The states of variables `N`, `a`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[2][6]` to it.**
