Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0. If the value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `dp[i][mask]`.***
