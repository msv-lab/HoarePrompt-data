The line of code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` modifies the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking its current value and applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact numerical impact, but we know that it will be reduced to the remainder when divided by `MOD`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is 3; `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its current value modulo `MOD`.**
