Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, `dp[3][2]` is the result of all valid updates made during the iterations of the loop modulo `MOD`, `j` is 0, the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and (1 left shifted by `j`) is non-zero.***
