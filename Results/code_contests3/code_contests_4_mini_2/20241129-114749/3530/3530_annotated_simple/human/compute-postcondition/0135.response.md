The code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

1. The variable `i` is currently 3, so `i - 1` equals 2.
2. The variable `mask` is 2, and `j` is 1. Thus, `1 << j` equals `1 << 1`, which is 2 in decimal.
3. The expression `mask ^ 1 << j` calculates `mask ^ 2`. Since `mask` is 2 (binary `10`), `mask ^ 2` will result in 0 (binary `00`).
4. Therefore, we access `dp[2][0]` and add it to `dp[3][2]`.

The actual values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are not provided, so we cannot compute the exact numerical result. However, we can say that the value of `dp[3][2]` is incremented by the value of `dp[2][0]`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `dp[3][2]` has been updated based on `dp[2][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[2][0]`**
