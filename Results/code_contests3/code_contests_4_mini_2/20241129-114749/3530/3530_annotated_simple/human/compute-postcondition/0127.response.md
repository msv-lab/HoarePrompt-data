Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1; `dp[i][mask]` is the result of all valid updates made during the iterations of the loop modulo `MOD`, where updates occur if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask` for each `j` in the range of `n`.**
