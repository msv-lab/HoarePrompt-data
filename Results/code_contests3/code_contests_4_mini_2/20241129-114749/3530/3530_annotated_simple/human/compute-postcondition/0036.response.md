Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is 2, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during the loop executions. The value of `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and `1 << j` is non-zero (indicating that the j-th bit of `mask` is set).***
