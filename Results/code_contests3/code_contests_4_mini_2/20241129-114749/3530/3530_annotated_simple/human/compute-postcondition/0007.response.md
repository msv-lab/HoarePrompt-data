According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than the number of iterations that have already been executed, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21. Given that the loop will execute `N` times, if it has executed `N-1` times so far, for the loop to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `N-1`, which is always true.

Since the loop is designed to iterate `N` times, and if it has executed `N-1` times, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `N-1` in the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `_` would need to be incremented to `N`, and this means that `_` is now `N`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, for the loop to execute a second time, `_` must be equal to `N`**
