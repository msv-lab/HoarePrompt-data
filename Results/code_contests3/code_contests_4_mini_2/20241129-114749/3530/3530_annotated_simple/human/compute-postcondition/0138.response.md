According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1, making `j` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 3**
