To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the given code in conjunction with the initial state.

1. **Initial State:** 
   - `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `MOD` is 1000000007.
   - `n` is an input string, which we can assume to represent the number of iterations the loop will execute, parsed as an integer.

2. **Loop Behavior:** 
   - The loop executes `n` times.
   - In each iteration, a list of integers from input is read and appended to list `a`. 

3. **Final State after Loop Execution:**
   - After the loop executes exactly `n` times, `a` will contain `n` lists of integers, where each list corresponds to the integers provided by the user during each iteration.
   - The value of `N` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.
   - The value of `MOD` also remains unchanged.

Assuming `n` is a valid integer that dictates the number of times the loop runs (which is between 1 and 21 based on the context given by `N`), the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is a list containing `n` lists of integers obtained from input; `MOD` is 1000000007.**
