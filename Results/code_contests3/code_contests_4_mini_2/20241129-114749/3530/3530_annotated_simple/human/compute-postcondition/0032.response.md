Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND 1 shifted left by `j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated and taken modulo `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
