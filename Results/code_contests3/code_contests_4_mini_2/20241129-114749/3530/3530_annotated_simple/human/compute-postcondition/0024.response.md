Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and for the loop to execute the first time `mask` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` is bitwise ANDed with `1 << j`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking its value modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
