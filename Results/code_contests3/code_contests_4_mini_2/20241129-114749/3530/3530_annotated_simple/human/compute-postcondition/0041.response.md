To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the situation step by step.

1. The code updates `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value from `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`. This operation involves:
   - The variable `i` is currently 1.
   - The variable `mask` is 2.
   - The variable `j` is 2.

2. The expression `1 << j` shifts the number 1 to the left by `j` positions, which means:
   - `1 << 2` equals 4 (in binary: 0001 becomes 0100).

3. The operation `mask ^ 1 << j` computes:
   - `mask ^ 4` where `mask` is 2 (in binary: 0010).
   - Therefore, `2 (0010) ^ 4 (0100)` results in `6 (0110)`.

4. The value `dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][6]`. Since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we cannot make any assumptions about the previous values. However, we can note that this operation modifies `dp[i][mask]`.

5. The output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the calculations.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][6]`**.
