The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the current value of `dp[i][mask]` and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. The specific values of `i` and `mask` are not provided, but they refer to indices in the `dp` array. The operation does not change the value being added but ensures the result stays within the bounds of `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[3][2]` is updated to be `dp[3][2] % MOD` after adding `dp[2][0]`.

Output State: **`dp[3][2]` is updated to be `dp[3][2] % MOD` after adding `dp[2][0]**
