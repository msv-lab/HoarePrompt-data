The line of code `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

To analyze this:
- `dp[i][mask]` is being modified, but we need to know its previous value to determine the new value.
- The term `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask value where the j-th bit of `mask` is toggled (changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
- The value being added is `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, which is dependent on the state of the `dp` array at the previous level (`i - 1`) and the modified mask.

Since we do not have the specific previous values of `dp[i][mask]` or `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, we cannot determine exact numerical results but can infer that the values of `dp[i][mask]` and `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` are involved in the calculation.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the previous state of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated by adding `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it.**
