According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition set by `n`. Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be 1 after the first iteration. 

The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 1, if the loop has executed at least once already, `j` would have been incremented to 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `mask` must be 2.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is currently 1 (after the first iteration) and `mask` is set to 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `mask` is 2, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during the loop executions.**
