The code `a.append(map(int, raw_input().split()))` is executed. This line takes input from the user, splits it into components, converts each component into an integer using `map`, and appends the resulting iterable to the list `a`. The variable `N` indicates that the loop will execute a second time when `_` equals `N`, but the current state of `a` is unknown. The values of `a` will change based on the input provided, and there are no changes to `N` or `_`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is updated with a list of integers from user input based on the current execution of the loop.
Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is updated with a list of integers from user input based on the current execution of the loop.**
