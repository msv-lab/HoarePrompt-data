According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j`, which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`. Given the state at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is currently 0. For the loop to execute a second time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `n` is at least 2, after incrementing, `j` will be 1, and the loop can execute again. The next iteration will check the condition for `a[i - 1][j]` where `i` is 2 and `j` will be 1, and it will also consider the updated `mask`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `mask` is the next value for the loop to execute a second time.**
