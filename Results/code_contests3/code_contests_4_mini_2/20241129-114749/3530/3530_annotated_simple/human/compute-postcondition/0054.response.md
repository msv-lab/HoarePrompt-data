Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND `1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking modulo `MOD`. If the condition is not met, no changes are made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
