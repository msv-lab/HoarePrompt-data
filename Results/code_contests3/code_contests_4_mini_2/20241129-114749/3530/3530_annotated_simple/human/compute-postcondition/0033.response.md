Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during the loop executions. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` AND 1 shifted left by `j` is true for any `j` in the range, then `dp[i][mask]` will reflect the accumulated values based on the previous row's `dp` values, taken modulo `MOD`.**
