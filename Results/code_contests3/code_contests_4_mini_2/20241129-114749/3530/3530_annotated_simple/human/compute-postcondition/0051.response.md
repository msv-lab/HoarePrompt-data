Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `mask` is 3, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during the loop executions, the element `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1, and the bitwise AND operation between `mask` and `1 << j` results in a non-zero value.***
