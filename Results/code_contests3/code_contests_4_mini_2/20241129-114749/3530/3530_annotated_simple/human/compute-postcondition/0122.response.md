Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 1; if `a[i - 1][j]` is 1 and the bit corresponding to `j` is set in `mask`, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated and now `dp[i][mask]` %= `MOD`. Otherwise, `dp[i][mask]` remains unchanged.***
