Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise AND with `1 << j` is true, then `dp[3][2]` is updated by applying modulo `MOD` after adding `dp[2][6]` to it. Otherwise, there is no change to `dp[3][2]`.***
