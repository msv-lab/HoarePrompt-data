Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `mask` is the next value for the loop to execute a second time. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, there are no changes made to `dp[i][mask]`.***
