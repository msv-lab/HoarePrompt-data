According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. Since the loop variable `j` will start from 0 and increment by 1, for the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be 2 (after the second iteration).

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, and `j` is 2**
