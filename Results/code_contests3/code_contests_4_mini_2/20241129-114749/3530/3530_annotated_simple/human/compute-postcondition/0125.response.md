The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the remainder of `dp[i][mask]` when divided by `MOD`. Since `dp[i][mask]` was previously updated by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it, the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` is now being constrained within the range of `0` to `MOD - 1`. Other variables `N`, `a`, `n`, `i`, `mask`, and `j` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains at least 1 list; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 3; `mask` is 1; `j` is 2; `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.**
