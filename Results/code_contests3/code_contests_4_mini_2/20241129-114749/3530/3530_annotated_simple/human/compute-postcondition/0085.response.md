The code `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulo of its current value with `MOD`. The value of `dp[i][mask]` is affected by this operation, while other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is unknown, but it will be updated to ensure it falls within the range defined by `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask]` modulo `MOD`**
