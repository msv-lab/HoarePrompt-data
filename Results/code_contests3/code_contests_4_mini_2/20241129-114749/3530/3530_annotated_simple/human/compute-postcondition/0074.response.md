The value of `dp[i][mask]` is updated using the modulo operation with `MOD`. This operation ensures that `dp[i][mask]` is within the bounds determined by `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` is modified, but other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`, and `dp[i][mask]` is now `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**.
