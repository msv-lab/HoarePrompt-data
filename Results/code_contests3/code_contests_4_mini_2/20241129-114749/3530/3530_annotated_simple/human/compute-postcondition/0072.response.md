According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1, and to execute the loop a second time, `n` must still be at least 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2**
