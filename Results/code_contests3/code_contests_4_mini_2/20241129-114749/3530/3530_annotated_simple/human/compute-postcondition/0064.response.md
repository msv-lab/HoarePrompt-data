Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `2^n - 1`, and `dp[i][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions met during all iterations of the loop, taken modulo `MOD`.**
