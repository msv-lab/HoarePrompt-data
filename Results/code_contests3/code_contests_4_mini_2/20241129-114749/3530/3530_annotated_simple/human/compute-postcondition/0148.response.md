Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, and `mask` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` is equal to 1 and `mask` AND (1 shifted left by `j`) is true, then `dp[3][3]` is updated to `dp[3][3] % MOD`. If the condition is not met, no updates are made to `dp[3][3]`.***
