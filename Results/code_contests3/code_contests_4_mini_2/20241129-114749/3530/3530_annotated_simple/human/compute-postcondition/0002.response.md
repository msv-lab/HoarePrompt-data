The code `a = []` initializes `a` as an empty list. This directly affects the variable `a`, setting it to an empty list regardless of its previous state. The other variables (`N`, `MOD`, `n`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` is an empty list; `MOD` is 1000000007; `n` is an input string**
