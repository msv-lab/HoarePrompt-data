Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 1, `j` is 0, `dp[i][mask]` is the result of all valid updates made during the iterations modulo `MOD`, the value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the bitwise AND of `mask` and 1 left-shifted by `j` is true (non-zero).***
