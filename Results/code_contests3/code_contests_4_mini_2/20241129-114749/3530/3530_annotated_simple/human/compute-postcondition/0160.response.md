Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is the length of `a`, `dp[N][mask]` contains the accumulated values based on the conditions met during all iterations of the loop for each possible `mask`, `i` is `N`, `mask` is in the range from 1 to `2^n - 1`, and `j` is in the range from 0 to `n - 1`; the value `dp[n][(1 << n) - 1]` is printed.**
