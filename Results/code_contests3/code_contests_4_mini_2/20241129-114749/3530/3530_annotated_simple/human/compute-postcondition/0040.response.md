According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21; `a` contains at least 1 list; `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `mask` is 2; if `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` has the j-th bit set, then `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking modulus with `MOD`.**
