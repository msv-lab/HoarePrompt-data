The statement `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. The expression `1 << j` represents a bitwise left shift, which effectively calculates `2^j`. The variable `mask` is being modified by XOR'ing it with `1 << j`, which changes the corresponding bit in `mask`. 

To summarize:
- `dp[i][mask]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i - 1][...]`.
- The previous values of `dp` at `i` and `i - 1`, as well as the current values of `mask` and `j`, will determine the outcome.
- Since `n` is at least 2, this ensures that `i` can be decremented without going out of bounds.

The specific values of `dp` depend on the initial state, but the overall structure suggests that the operation accomplishes an aggregation of computed values across states.

Since no specific numbers are provided for `dp`, `mask`, or `j`, the output state reflects the aggregation process itself.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated based on `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]`**
