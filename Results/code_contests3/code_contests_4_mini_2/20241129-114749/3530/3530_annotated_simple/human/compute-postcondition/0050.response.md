According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The initial state mentions that `i` is 1, which is appropriate for the loop's first execution. The variable `j` is also defined as `n`, which will be updated during the loop iterations starting from 0. 

For the loop to execute, we must ensure that `j` starts at 0. Given that the loop iterates `n` times starting at `j = 0`, we can confirm that the loop will execute successfully.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `mask` is 3, `dp[i][mask]` has been updated based on the conditions met during the loop executions, for the loop to execute the first time `j` should start at 0**
