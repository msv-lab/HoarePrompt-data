Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `mask` is 2, `j` is 1. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` bitwise ANDed with 1 left-shifted by `j` is non-zero, then `dp[3][2]` is updated to be `dp[3][2] % MOD` after adding `dp[2][0]`. Otherwise, no changes occur to the program state.***
