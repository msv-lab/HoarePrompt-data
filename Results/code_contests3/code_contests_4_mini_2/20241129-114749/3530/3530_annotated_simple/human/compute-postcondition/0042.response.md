The operation `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with respect to `MOD`. This operation will affect `dp[i][mask]` but does not change the values of other variables. Since the previous value of `dp[i][mask]` was updated by adding `dp[i - 1][6]`, the new value of `dp[i][mask]` becomes `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. The specific value of `MOD` is not given, but it is assumed to be a positive integer.

Thus, the Output State is: `dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to `dp[i][mask] % MOD`**
