The expression `dp[i][mask] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. The previous value of `dp[i][mask]` has been updated by adding `dp[i - 1][2]`, but the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` and `MOD` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i][mask]` has been modified by taking the modulus with `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` has been updated by taking modulo `MOD`**
