Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `mask` is 3, and `j` is 3. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask` & 1 << j is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated by taking the remainder of its previous value when divided by `MOD`.***
