The expression `dp[i][mask] += dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` updates the value of `dp[i][mask]` by adding the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 1 << j]` to it. 

- `i` is currently 2, so `i - 1` is 1.
- The value `mask ^ 1 << j` computes a new mask by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `mask` and `1` shifted left by `j`. Since `j` is 2, this means we are XORing `mask` with `4` (which is `1 << 2`).
- The resultant value of `dp[i][mask]` will now include contributions from `dp[1][mask ^ 4]`.

The values of `N`, `a`, `n`, and the previous values of `dp` are not directly affected by this line of code, but the specific value of `dp[i][mask]` will change based on the calculation described.

Since we don't have the specific values for `dp`, `mask`, or the exact computation, the output state will reflect the changes made by the code.

Output State: **`dp[i][mask]` is updated to include the value of `dp[i - 1][mask ^ 4]`.**
