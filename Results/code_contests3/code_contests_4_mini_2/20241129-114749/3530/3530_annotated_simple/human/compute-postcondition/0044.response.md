According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. Since `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute for the third time. 

After the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` becomes 3. 

Hence, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `mask` is 2.**
