Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute a third time `n` must be greater than 2. If `a[i - 1][j]` equals 1 and `mask & 1 << j` is true, then `dp[i][mask]` is updated to be `dp[i][mask] % MOD`. Otherwise, no changes occur to `dp[i][mask]`.***
