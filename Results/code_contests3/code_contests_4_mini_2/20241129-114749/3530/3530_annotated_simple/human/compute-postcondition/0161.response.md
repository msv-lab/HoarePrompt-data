The function `func` accepts two parameters: `N` and `a`. `N` is an integer that must satisfy the condition 1 <= N <= 21. The parameter `a` is a 2D list of integers where each element is either 0 or 1, with dimensions N x N. The function does not return any explicit value in the provided output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `N` and a 2D list `a` of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions N x N. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list a of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions N x N.**
