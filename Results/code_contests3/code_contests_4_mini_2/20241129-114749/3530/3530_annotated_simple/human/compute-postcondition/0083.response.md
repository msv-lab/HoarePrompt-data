Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 1 <= `N` <= 21, `a` contains at least 1 list, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `mask` is the next value (which is `mask + 1`), `dp[i][mask]` is the result of all valid updates made during the iterations modulo `MOD`. The value at `a[i - 1][j]` is 1, and the `mask` includes the bit corresponding to `j`.***
