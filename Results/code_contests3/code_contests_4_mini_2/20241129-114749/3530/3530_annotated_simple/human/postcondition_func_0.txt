The function accepts an integer `N` (where 1 <= N <= 21) and a 2D list `a` of integers (0s and 1s) with dimensions N x N. It calculates a dynamic programming table to determine the number of ways to select a set of items such that no two selected items are in conflict, as represented in the input list. Finally, it prints the total number of valid selections modulo 1000000007.
