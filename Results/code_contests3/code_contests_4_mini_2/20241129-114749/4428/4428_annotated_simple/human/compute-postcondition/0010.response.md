The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, and it is assumed to be an integer. The logic of the loop ensures that `N` is greater than `current i + 1`, allowing the loop to execute one more time. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is incremented to `current i + 1`; `result` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1; `i` is incremented to `current i + 1`; `result` is incremented by 1.**
