According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the input integer `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current iteration index, and `N` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1. 

If we denote the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `current i + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than `current i + 1`.

State: **`N` is an input integer greater than or equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time `N` must be greater than `current i + 1`, and `i` will be incremented to `current i + 1`.**
