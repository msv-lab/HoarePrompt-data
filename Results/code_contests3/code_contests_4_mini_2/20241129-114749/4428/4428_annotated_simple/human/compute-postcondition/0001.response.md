`S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string. The length of `S` must equal `N`, consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D', but the actual input value is not specified. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `S` is now an input string of length `N`.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer; `S` is an input string of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D' characters.**
