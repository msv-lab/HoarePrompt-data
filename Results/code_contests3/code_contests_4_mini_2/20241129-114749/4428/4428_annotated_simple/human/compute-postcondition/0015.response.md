The code `result -= 1` decrements the value of `result` by 1. The variable `result` is affected, while `N` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in this operation. Since `N` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is incremented to `current i + 1`, we can conclude that `result` will be decreased by 1. However, the exact previous value of `result` is unknown.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented to `current i + 1`, and `result` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented to `current i + 1`, and `result` is decreased by 1.**
