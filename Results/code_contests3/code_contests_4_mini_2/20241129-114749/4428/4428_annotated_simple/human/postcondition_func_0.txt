The function accepts a positive integer `N` (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` containing only the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the count of 'I' and the count of 'D' in `S`. If this difference is negative, it sets the result to 0 before printing it. Thus, the function effectively counts how many more 'I's than 'D's are in the string, ensuring the result is not negative.
