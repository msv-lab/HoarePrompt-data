`N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string `S` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `N` is now an input integer while `S` remains as a string of length `N` consisting of 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of 'I' and 'D'**
