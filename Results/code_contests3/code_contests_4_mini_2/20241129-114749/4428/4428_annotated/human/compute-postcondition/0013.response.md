According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 2**
