The function accepts an integer `N` (where 1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates a `result` which is the count of 'I' characters minus the count of 'D' characters in `S`. If the `result` is negative, it is set to 0 before being printed. Therefore, the function effectively returns the net count of 'I's over 'D's, ensuring that the output is non-negative.
