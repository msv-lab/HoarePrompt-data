The value of `N` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input` accepts an input as a string and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, it retains its properties. The variable `S` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `S` is a string of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'**.
