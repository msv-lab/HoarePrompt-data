The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The other variables `N` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1, and `result` is increased by 1.**
