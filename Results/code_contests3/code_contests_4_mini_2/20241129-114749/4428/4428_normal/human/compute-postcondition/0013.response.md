According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, and thus it must now be compared to `N`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `N`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` has been incremented, and for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`. 

Thus, if `i` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration, it would now be `i`, which needs to be less than `N`. To adjust the state for the next iteration, we can denote that `i` is now equal to the previous value plus 1.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is the value after incrementing by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `i` must be less than `N`**
