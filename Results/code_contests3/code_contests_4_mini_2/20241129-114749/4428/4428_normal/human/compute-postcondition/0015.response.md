The `result` variable is decremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is not specified, but it will be one less than its original value after the execution. The state of `N` and `i` remains unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change in `result`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is the value after incrementing by 1, `result` is decremented by 1**
