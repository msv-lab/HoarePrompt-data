According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at some value less than `N` since the loop iterates from `0` to `N-1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` will need to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if it was `i` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` will now be `i + 1`. 

Since `N` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ N ≤ 100`, and the loop will continue while `i < N`, to execute one more time, `N` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than `i + 1**.
