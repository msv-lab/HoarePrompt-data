The value of `result` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `result` is unknown. The values of `N` and `i` remain unchanged, with `N` being a positive integer between 1 and 100, and `i` being incremented by 1. Since this line does not affect `N` or `i` but alters `result`, the output state reflects this change. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `i` is incremented by 1; `result` is decreased by 1**
