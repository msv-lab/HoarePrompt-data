The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, it operates on two implicit constraints: `N`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, and `S`, which is a string of length N consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. 

The output of the function is determined by the conditions based on the characters in the string `S`. Given that the function does not specify its return value in the provided context, we can summarize the parameter constraints and relationships. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to operate based on the implicit parameters N and S, where N is a positive integer, and S is a string of specified characters. However, as the output is not defined in the provided information, we cannot detail the return values.

Functionality: **The function operates on a positive integer N and a string S of length N consisting of 'I' and 'D'. The exact return value is not specified.**
