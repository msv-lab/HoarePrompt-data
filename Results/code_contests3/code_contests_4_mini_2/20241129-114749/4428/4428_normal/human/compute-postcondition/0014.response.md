The variable `result` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `result` is not specified, but it is increased by 1. The variables `N` and `i` remain unaffected in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is the value after incrementing by 1, and `result` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, `i` is the value after incrementing by 1, and `result` is increased by 1.**
