The function accepts a positive integer `N` (between 1 and 100) and a string `S` of length `N` consisting only of the characters 'I' and 'D'. It calculates the difference between the count of 'I's and 'D's in the string, ensuring that the result is not negative. Finally, it prints the result, which represents the net count of 'I's after decrementing for each 'D'. If the calculated result is less than 0, it prints 0 instead.
