Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. If `i` is one of 'H', 'Q', or '9', then 'YES' is not printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of these characters, the behavior of the program is not specified as there is no else part.***
