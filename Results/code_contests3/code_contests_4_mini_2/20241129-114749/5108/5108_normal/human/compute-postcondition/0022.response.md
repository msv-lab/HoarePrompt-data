Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input containing up to 100 characters, where each character's ASCII code is between 33 and 126. It checks if the string contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and assigns the string 'tstr123' to the variable. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and does not handle cases where the input string is empty. **
