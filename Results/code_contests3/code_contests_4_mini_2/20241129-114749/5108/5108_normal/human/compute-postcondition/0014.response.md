The value of `a` is assigned the string 'tstr123'. The previous values of `p` and `i` remain unchanged, but since `a` now holds a new value, `i`'s value will depend on the index `j + 1`, which is not defined in the current context. Without knowing the value of `j`, we cannot determine the exact character that `i` will represent. However, the statement indicates that 'YES' is printed, which does not affect the variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'; `i` is dependent on `j`, and 'YES' is printed. 

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is 'tstr123'; `i` is dependent on `j`, and 'YES' is printed.**
