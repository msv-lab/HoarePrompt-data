`a` is assigned the value 'tstr123'. The previous value of `i` is the first character of `a`, which is 't'. Since 't' is not 'H', 'Q', or '9', the condition for printing 'YES' is not met. The variable `p` remains unchanged as it is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and 'YES' is not printed.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', `i` is 't', and 'YES' is not printed.**
