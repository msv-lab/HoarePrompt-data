Functionality: ** The function accepts user input as a string (expected to be between 1 and 100 characters long with ASCII codes between 33 and 126). It checks if the input string contains any of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and sets a variable `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are found, it prints 'NO'. There is no return value from the function. **
