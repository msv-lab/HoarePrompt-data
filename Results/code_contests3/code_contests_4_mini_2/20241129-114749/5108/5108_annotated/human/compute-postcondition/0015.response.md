The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, for the loop to execute one more time `a` must have more characters remaining, `i` is the next character in `a`, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the loop.
