Postcondition: ***`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters, `a` is 'tstr123', and `i` is 't'. If `i` is one of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not one of those characters, the execution continues without any specific else condition defined.***
