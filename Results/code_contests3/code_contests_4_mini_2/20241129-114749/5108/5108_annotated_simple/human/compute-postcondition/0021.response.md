The function `func` accepts a parameter `p`. `p` is a string that contains between 1 and 100 characters, where each character has an ASCII code between 33 and 126. The string may contain uppercase characters 'H', 'Q', '9', and '+' as valid instructions, while other characters are ignored. The function processes the string and returns a value based on the valid instructions found.
