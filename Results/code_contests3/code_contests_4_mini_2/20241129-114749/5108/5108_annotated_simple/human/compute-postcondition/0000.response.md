The variable `a` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which will accept a string input from the user. The initial state of `p` is not affected by this operation, and since `raw_input()` is not evaluated here, we cannot determine the value of `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is an input string from the user.

Output State: **`p` is a string containing between 1 and 100 characters; `a` is an input string from the user.**
