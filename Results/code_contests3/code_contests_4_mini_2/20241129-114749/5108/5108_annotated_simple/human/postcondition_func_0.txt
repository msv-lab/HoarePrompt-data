The function accepts a string input `a` and checks for the presence of the characters 'H', 'Q', or '9'. If any of these characters are found, it prints 'YES' and changes `a` to 'tstr123'. If none of these characters are found, the function prints 'NO'. The function does not handle any invalid input cases or characters outside of the specified ones, and it only checks for specific characters while ignoring others.
