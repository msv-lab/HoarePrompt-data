The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. Additionally, it expects a ticket number, which is a positive integer of length exactly `n`, containing only the digits 4 and 7. The function does not return any values as it is defined without parameters and no return statement is provided in the given context. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to validate the ticket number based on the constraints of `n` and the digits used.

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number of length n that contains only the digits 4 and 7, and it validates these inputs.**
