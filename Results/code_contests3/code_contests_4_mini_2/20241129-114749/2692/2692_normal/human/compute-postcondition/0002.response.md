The variable `digits` is assigned the result of `map(int, raw_input().strip())`, which means it will take an input string, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and convert each character in that string to an integer. The initial state of `n` does not change, and the state of `digits` will depend on the input provided. Since `n` is constrained to be an even integer and is an input integer, the output state reflects that `digits` will hold the mapped integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 50; `digits` will hold the mapped integers from the input.**
