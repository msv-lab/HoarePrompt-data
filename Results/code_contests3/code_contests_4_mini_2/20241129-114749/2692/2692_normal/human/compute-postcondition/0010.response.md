Functionality: ** The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and expects a ticket number as input, which is a series of digits of length `n` containing only the digits 4 and 7. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, the function does not handle cases where the input does not strictly contain only the digits 4 and 7, nor does it validate the length of the digits against `n` before performing calculations. **
