`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input().strip())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The current constraints on `n` are maintained, as it is defined to be an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `n` is an input integer**
