Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a ticket is lucky based on the problem description. Specifically, it fails to check if all digits in the ticket number are lucky digits (4 or 7). 

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input:
```
4
1234
```
- Expected Output: "NO" (since the number is not a lucky number; it contains digits other than 4 and 7).
- Actual Output: "NO" (but the program does not confirm that the digits are lucky before checking the sum of the halves).

Another case:
- Input:
```
4
4444
```
- Expected Output: "YES" (since it is a lucky number and the halves both sum to 8).
- Actual Output: "YES" (this works correctly).

However, the program does not handle cases where some digits are not lucky even if the sums are equal. For example:
- Input:
```
4
4747
```
- Expected Output: "YES" (since all digits are lucky and both halves sum to 11).
- Actual Output: "YES" (this works correctly).

But it lacks a critical check for the lucky digits. 

Thus, it does not fulfill the complete requirement of the problem statement, making the program incorrect.
