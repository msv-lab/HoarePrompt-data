Functionality: ** The function reads an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of digits (ticket_number) of length exactly `n`. It checks whether the sum of the first half of the digits equals the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result based on the comparison of the sums. Additionally, the input handling assumes that the input is valid and does not account for any invalid input cases. **
