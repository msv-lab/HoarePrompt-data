The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `ticket_number`. The parameter `n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. The parameter `ticket_number` is a string of digits with a length exactly equal to `n` and consists only of the digits 0 to 9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, thus we cannot determine the return value based on the given constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an even integer `n` within the specified range and a string `ticket_number` that meets the criteria of length and character composition. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string `ticket_number` of digits with length exactly `n` consisting only of the digits 0 to 9.**
