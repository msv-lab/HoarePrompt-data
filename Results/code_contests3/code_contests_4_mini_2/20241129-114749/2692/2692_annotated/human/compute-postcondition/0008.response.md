Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, and `ticket_number` is a string of digits with length exactly `n` consisting only of the digits 0 to 9. If the sum of the first half of the digits (converted from `ticket_number`) equals the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
