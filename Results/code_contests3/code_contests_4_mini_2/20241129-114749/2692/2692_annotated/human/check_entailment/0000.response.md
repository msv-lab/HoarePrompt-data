Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description for determining if a ticket is a lucky ticket. Here are the reasons why it is incorrect:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The problem states that a ticket is considered lucky if it is a lucky number (consists only of the digits 4 and 7). The provided program does not include any checks to verify whether all the digits of the ticket number are either 4 or 7. This is a critical requirement from the problem description.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the sums of the first half and the second half of the digits, but it does not correctly handle the input conversion from the string to a list of integers. The `map(int, raw_input().strip())` part will not work as intended because `raw_input()` returns a string, and `map(int, ...)` will apply `int` to each character of that string. The program should first convert the ticket number string into a list of characters and then into integers.

3. **Indexing Error**: The indexing used in the sum calculation `(digits[n / 2 + n % 2:])` is incorrect. It should be `digits[n / 2:]` to correctly slice the second half of the list.

Due to these issues, the program fails to meet the complete requirements of the problem description, which results in it being deemed incorrect. A valid implementation should check for lucky digits, correctly handle input parsing, and ensure proper indexing for summation.
