Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Lucky Number Check**: The problem description states that a ticket number must be a lucky number, which means it should consist only of the digits 4 and 7. However, the program does not contain any check to ensure that the digits of the ticket number are exclusively 4 or 7. As a result, it would accept ticket numbers that contain other digits (like 3, 5, 6, etc.) as valid, which violates the lucky number requirement.

2. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to compare the sums of the first half and the second half of the digits using the expression `digits[n / 2 + n % 2:]`. This is incorrect because it should simply be `digits[n / 2:]` to get the second half. The expression `n % 2` is unnecessary since `n` is guaranteed to be even.

3. **Input Method**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. If this code is intended for Python 3, this would lead to a runtime error.

The combination of these issues means that the program does not accurately implement the requirements set out in the problem description. A valid ticket number must be checked for being a lucky number and the sums of the digits must be correctly compared.

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements in critical ways.
