The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `raw_input().strip()`, which reads a line of input as a string and removes any leading or trailing whitespace before converting it to an integer. Since `n` is specified to be an even integer within the range of 2 to 50, it will hold a positive integer value in that range after the input. The ticket number is not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
