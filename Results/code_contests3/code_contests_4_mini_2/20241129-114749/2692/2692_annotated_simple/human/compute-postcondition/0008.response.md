Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `digits` is a list of integers derived from the input ticket number, which is a positive integer represented as a string of length `n`, containing only the lucky digits 4 and 7. If the sum of the first half of `digits` equals the sum of the second half, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
