The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `n` and `digits` do not change as a result of this print statement. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of `n` and `digits` along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `digits` is assigned the result of mapping int over the input from raw_input(); printed output is 'NO'**
