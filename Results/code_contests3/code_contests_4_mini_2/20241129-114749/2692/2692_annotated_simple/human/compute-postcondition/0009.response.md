The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50. It also accepts a ticket number, which is a positive integer represented as a string of length `n` consisting of digits that may include leading zeros. The ticket number must contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. After executing the function body, it checks if the ticket number is a lucky ticket based on the conditions provided.

Since the output details are not specified in the prompt, we cannot define specific return cases.
