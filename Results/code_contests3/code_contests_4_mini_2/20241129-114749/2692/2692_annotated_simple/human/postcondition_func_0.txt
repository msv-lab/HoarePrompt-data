The function accepts an even integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a ticket number, represented as a string of length `n`, which must consist solely of the digits 4 and 7. It checks if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. If they are equal, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value, it only prints the result based on the condition. Additionally, there is a potential edge case if the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., if `n` is not even or if the ticket number contains digits other than 4 and 7), which is not handled in the code.
