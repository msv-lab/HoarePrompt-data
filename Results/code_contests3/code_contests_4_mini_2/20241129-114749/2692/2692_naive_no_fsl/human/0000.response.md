Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly check if the ticket number is a lucky number as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all digits of the ticket number are lucky digits (i.e., only 4s and 7s). 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
4771
```
In this case, the program would check the sums of the halves and return "YES" because both halves (477 and 1) have equal sums (7). However, the ticket number 4771 is not a lucky number because it contains the digit '1', which is not a lucky digit. 

Thus, the program does not adhere to the requirement that the ticket number must be a lucky number, which leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
