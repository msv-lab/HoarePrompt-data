Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of a single lowercase English letter and returns True if `ch` is a consonant (not in 'aeiou') and False if `ch` is a vowel (in 'aeiou'). However, it does not handle cases where `ch` is a string longer than one character, which would lead to incorrect behavior. It is designed to evaluate only individual characters. **
