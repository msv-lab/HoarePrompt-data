#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 3000.
def func_1(ch):
    return not ch in 'aeiou'
    #The program returns True if 'ch' is a consonant (not in 'aeiou') and False if 'ch' is a vowel (in 'aeiou').
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `ch` consisting of a single lowercase English letter and returns True if `ch` is a consonant (not in 'aeiou') and False if `ch` is a vowel (in 'aeiou'). However, it does not handle cases where `ch` is a string longer than one character, which would lead to incorrect behavior. It is designed to evaluate only individual characters.
