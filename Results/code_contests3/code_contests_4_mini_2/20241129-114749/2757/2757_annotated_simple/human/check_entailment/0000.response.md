Correctness: **False**

The provided program only contains a single function, `func_1`, which checks if a character `ch` is a consonant or a vowel. It returns `True` if `ch` is a consonant (i.e., not in the string 'aeiou') and `False` if it is a vowel. However, this function alone does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which involves more complex logic for identifying and handling typos in entire words based on the presence of consecutive consonants.

The problem description requires the implementation of a feature that:
1. Identifies if a word contains three or more consecutive consonants that are not all the same, indicating a typo.
2. If a typo is found, it should insert spaces into the word to remove the typos by splitting it into valid segments.

The `func_1` function does not perform any of these tasks. It does not analyze the entire word, check for blocks of consonants, or insert spaces as required by the problem. Therefore, it does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem description.

In summary, the provided program lacks the necessary logic to identify and correct typos in a word according to the specified criteria. It only checks individual characters, which is insufficient for solving the problem.
