Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the main issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input as floating-point numbers directly. However, according to the problem description, the input consists of strings formatted as arithmetic expressions of the form "(a+b)/c". The program does not parse these strings or compute their values correctly; instead, it attempts to convert them directly to floats, which will lead to errors.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program fails to evaluate the arithmetic expressions. It does not compute the value of the expressions "(a+b)/c" as required, which means it does not produce the correct jump coordinates for the ships.

3. **Counting Logic**: The counting mechanism used in the program (using `test_list.count(i)`) is inefficient and does not correctly represent the intended functionality. It counts occurrences of each floating-point number in the list, but since the numbers themselves are not being computed from valid expressions, this does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

4. **Output Format**: The expected output is a single line containing space-separated integers representing the number of ships ending up at the same coordinate. Since the coordinates are not calculated, the output will not reflect the correct counts.

In summary, the program does not process the input in the required format, does not evaluate the expressions correctly, and therefore cannot produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.
