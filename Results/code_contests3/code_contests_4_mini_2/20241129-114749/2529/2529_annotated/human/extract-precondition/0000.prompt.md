You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Your task

Problem description: The Rebel fleet is on the run. It consists of m ships currently gathered around a single planet. Just a few seconds ago, the vastly more powerful Empire fleet has appeared in the same solar system, and the Rebels will need to escape into hyperspace. In order to spread the fleet, the captain of each ship has independently come up with the coordinate to which that ship will jump. In the obsolete navigation system used by the Rebels, this coordinate is given as the value of an arithmetic expression of the form <image>.

To plan the future of the resistance movement, Princess Heidi needs to know, for each ship, how many ships are going to end up at the same coordinate after the jump. You are her only hope!

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200 000) – the number of ships. The next m lines describe one jump coordinate each, given as an arithmetic expression. An expression has the form (a+b)/c. Namely, it consists of: an opening parenthesis (, a positive integer a of up to two decimal digits, a plus sign +, a positive integer b of up to two decimal digits, a closing parenthesis ), a slash /, and a positive integer c of up to two decimal digits.

Output

Print a single line consisting of m space-separated integers. The i-th integer should be equal to the number of ships whose coordinate is equal to that of the i-th ship (including the i-th ship itself).

Example

Input

4
(99+98)/97
(26+4)/10
(12+33)/15
(5+1)/7


Output

1 2 2 1 

Note

In the sample testcase, the second and the third ship will both end up at the coordinate 3.

Note that this problem has only two versions – easy and hard.
