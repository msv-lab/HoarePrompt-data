The code initializes `my_list` as an empty list. It does not affect the existing variables `m`, `test_list`, or `i`, which retain their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; the last value appended to `test_list` is the last float input; `i` is `m - 1`; `my_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; the last value appended to `test_list` is the last float input; `i` is `m - 1`; `my_list` is an empty list.**
