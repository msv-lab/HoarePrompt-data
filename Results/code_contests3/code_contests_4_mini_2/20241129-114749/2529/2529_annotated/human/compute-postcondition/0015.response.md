According to the code, the loop iterates over each floating-point number in `test_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first floating-point number in `test_list`, and `my_list` contains the count of `i` in `test_list`. The loop will execute one more time if there are more floating-point numbers left in `test_list` to iterate over.

Since `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, and the loop has already processed the first number, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be the second floating-point number in `test_list`. Therefore, `my_list` will also need to account for the count of this new `i`.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; `i` is the second floating-point number in `test_list`; `my_list` contains the count of the second floating-point number in `test_list`.**
