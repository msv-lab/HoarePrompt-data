`e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. The values of `m`, `test_list`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `e` is a floating-point number input.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `e` is a floating-point number input.**
