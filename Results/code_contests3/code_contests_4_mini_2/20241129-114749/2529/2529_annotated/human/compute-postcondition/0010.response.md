The code `test_list.append(e)` appends the value of `e` to `test_list`. The previous values of the affected variables are `test_list` (which receives the new value) and `e` (which is a float input). The other variables such as `m` and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the appended value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `e` is a float input; `test_list` now includes the appended value of `e.**
