The value of `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`. The previous values of the affected variables are `test_list` containing at least 3 floating-point numbers and `i` being the third floating-point number in `test_list`. The count of `i` in `test_list` is determined, and this count is appended to `my_list`. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `m` â‰¤ 200,000; `test_list` contains at least 3 floating-point numbers; `i` is the third floating-point number in `test_list`; `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list.**
