According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_list`. If `test_list` contains additional items, the loop can continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently the second floating-point number in `test_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be updated to the third floating-point number in `test_list`, and the total count of `i` in `test_list` must be included in `my_list`.

Since `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, and `i` is currently the second element, to execute the loop again, `test_list` must contain at least 3 elements.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains at least 3 floating-point numbers; `i` is the third floating-point number in `test_list`; `my_list` is updated to include the count of `i` in `test_list`.**
