The code appends the float value `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged, and there is no information provided about the previous state or contents of `test_list`. Therefore, we note that `e` is added to `test_list`. 

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `e` is a float input; `e` is appended to `test_list`**
