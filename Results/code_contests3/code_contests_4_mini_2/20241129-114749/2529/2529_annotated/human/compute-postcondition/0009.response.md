The variable `e` is assigned the value of `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `e` is a float input, `e` is appended to `test_list`, `i` is `m - 1` for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `m`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `e` is a float input, `e` is appended to `test_list`, `i` is `m - 1` for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `m`**.
