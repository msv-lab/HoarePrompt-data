Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) as input and then reads `m` floating-point numbers. It counts the occurrences of each number in the input list and prints these counts as space-separated values. The function does not process any specific jump coordinates as strings, and it may produce incorrect results if the same number appears multiple times, as it counts occurrences for each element within the input list. There is no return value from the function; it only outputs the counts directly to the console. **
