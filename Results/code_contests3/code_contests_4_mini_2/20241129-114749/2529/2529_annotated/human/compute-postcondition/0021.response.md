The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it uses an integer `m` that is constrained to the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000. Additionally, it processes jump coordinates formatted as strings in the form "(a+b)/c", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers up to two decimal digits. 

The function returns a result based on the processing of these jump coordinates. However, the specific output or behavior based on these inputs is not provided in the description.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer m constrained to the range 1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000 and jump coordinates as strings formatted as "(a+b)/c", where a, b, and c are positive integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of these jump coordinates.**
