After the loop executes over all the elements in `test_list`, `my_list` will contain the counts of each floating-point number in `test_list`. Since `my_list` is populated with the count of each unique element every time it is iterated, the final output state reflects that `my_list` will have a length equal to `m`, and each value in `my_list` will correspond to the number of occurrences of the respective floating-point number in `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers; `i` is the last floating-point number in `test_list`; `my_list` contains the counts of each floating-point number in `test_list`, with the length of `my_list` equal to `m`.**
