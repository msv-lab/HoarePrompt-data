According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is an input integer constrained to be between 1 and 200,000, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once if `m` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `test_list` being empty does not affect the execution of the loop since the loop does not depend on `test_list`. 

At the beginning of the first iteration, `i` will start from 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `m` must be at least 1, and `i` will be 0.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `test_list` is an empty list, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
