According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is still within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `i` must be equal to the current iteration count. Since `i` increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. 

Thus, if `i` is currently equal to (m - 1), then for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must remain greater than `i + 1`. 

Therefore, if `i` is currently equal to `m - 1`, the updated state for the next iteration will be:
State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000, `e` is a float input, `e` is appended to `test_list`, `i` is `m - 1` for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than `m`.**
