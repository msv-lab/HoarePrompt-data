According to the code, the for loop will execute if `test_list` contains at least one floating-point number. Given that `m` is at least 1, `test_list` will contain `m` floating-point numbers, which means it will have at least one element. Therefore, the loop can execute.

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will take on the value of the first element in `test_list`. Since the last value appended to `test_list` is the last float input, the first element is the first float in the list.

For the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure:
1. `test_list` contains at least 1 floating-point number.
2. `i` will be assigned the first element of `test_list`.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200,000; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers with at least 1 element, `i` is the first floating-point number in `test_list`, and `my_list` is an empty list.**
