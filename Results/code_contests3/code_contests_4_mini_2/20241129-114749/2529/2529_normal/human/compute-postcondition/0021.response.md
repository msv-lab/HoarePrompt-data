The function `func` accepts a parameter `m`, which is a positive integer constrained between 1 and 200,000. Additionally, it takes a series of jump coordinates, each represented as a string in the form '(a+b)/c', where `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers with up to two decimal digits. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified jump coordinates. However, the exact nature of the output based on these inputs is not provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and a series of jump coordinates as strings in the form '(a+b)/c', where a, b, and c are positive integers. It returns a result based on these inputs.**
