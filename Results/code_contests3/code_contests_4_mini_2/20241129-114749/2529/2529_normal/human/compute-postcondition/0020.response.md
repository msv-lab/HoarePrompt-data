The code prints the elements of `my_list` as a string, separated by spaces. The other variables are not affected, and the specific contents of `my_list` are not provided, but it is stated to contain the counts of each element in `test_list`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `my_list` will be printed as a space-separated string.

Output State: **`my_list` contains the counts of each element in `test_list`, printed as a space-separated string.**
