The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged, `i` also remains unchanged, and `e` is a float input. The output state reflects that the list `test_list` now includes the value of `e`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `i` is 1, `e` is a float input, and `test_list` now contains the float value `e`.**
