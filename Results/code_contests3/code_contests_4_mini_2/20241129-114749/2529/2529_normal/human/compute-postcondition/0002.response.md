According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. Since `m` is a positive integer and is specified to be at least 1, the loop will execute as long as `m` is within the specified range. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `m - 1`. Since `test_list` is empty, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` will start at 0.

State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1**
