The value of `my_list` is changed by appending the count of the occurrences of `i` in `test_list`. The variable `test_list` is non-empty, and `i` is some value that exists in the context of the loop. Therefore, `my_list` is updated with the count of `i` in `test_list`. The previous values of `m`, `test_list`, and `my_list` are not specified, but `my_list` will now include the count of `i`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000); `test_list` is a non-empty list; `my_list` is updated with the count of `i` in `test_list.**
