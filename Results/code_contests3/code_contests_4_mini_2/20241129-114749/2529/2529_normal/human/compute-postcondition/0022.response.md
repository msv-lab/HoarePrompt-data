The function `func` accepts a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000) and a series of floating-point numbers entered by the user. It counts the occurrences of each number in the list of inputs and prints these counts as a space-separated string. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotations and the actual behavior of the code: the code does not process jump coordinates in the form '(a+b)/c' as suggested by the annotations, nor does it handle any potential errors related to input types. Thus, the functionality of the function is to read a series of floating-point numbers, count their occurrences, and print the counts, regardless of the annotations suggesting otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `m`, reads `m` floating-point numbers from user input, counts the occurrences of each number, and prints the counts as a space-separated string. **
