According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000). For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1 (since `i` will be incremented). 

After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute for the second time, `i` will be 2. 

State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 2**.
