According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_list`. Since `my_list` is an empty list, the loop will not execute unless `test_list` contains at least one element. The variable `i` will also need to be initialized but is not relevant to the loop execution because it will only be assigned when the loop runs. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `test_list` must have at least one element.

State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), for the loop to execute the first time `test_list` is a non-empty list**
