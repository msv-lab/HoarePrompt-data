The variable `test_list` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `m` is assigned a value from `int(input())`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The initialization of `test_list` does not affect `m` or its value. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `m` and `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `test_list` is an empty list**
