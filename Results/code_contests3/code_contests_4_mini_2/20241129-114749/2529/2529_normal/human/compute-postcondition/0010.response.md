The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` and `i` remain unchanged, as the operation only affects the list. Given that `e` is a floating-point number input, it will be added to the `test_list`. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 200,000), `i` is 2, `e` is a floating-point number input, and `e` has been appended to `test_list.**
