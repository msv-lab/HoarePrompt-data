Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains a significant flaw in how it processes the input expressions. The problem description specifies that the input should be arithmetic expressions of the form "(a+b)/c", but the program is reading each expression as a floating-point number directly. This means that it does not parse the input correctly, and will throw an error when it attempts to convert the input string to a float, as input strings will not be valid float representations.

For example, if the input is:
```
(99+98)/97
```
The program will attempt to convert the string "(99+98)/97" into a float, which will fail. Therefore, the program does not handle the input format as specified in the problem description.

Additionally, even if it could process the strings correctly, the program does not properly calculate the coordinates based on the arithmetic expressions, nor does it account for the fact that multiple expressions can result in the same final coordinate.

In summary, the program fails to correctly read and evaluate the input expressions, and thus does not meet the requirements of the problem as a whole.
