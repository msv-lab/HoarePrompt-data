The provided program is intended to compute the number of ships that will land at the same coordinate after jumping to a coordinate specified by an arithmetic expression of the form (a+b)/c.

However, there is a critical flaw in the program. The input is expected to be in the form of an arithmetic expression, but the program reads the input as a floating-point number directly. This means that it does not parse the arithmetic expression correctly. Instead of performing the arithmetic operation to find the coordinate value, it tries to convert the whole expression into a float, which will not yield the correct result.

For instance, if the input is:
```
(99+98)/97
```
The program will attempt to read this as a float, which will lead to a ValueError, as the input format is not a valid float.

Furthermore, the program does not handle the parsing of the arithmetic expression at all. It fails to compute the actual coordinate from the given expression, which is essential for counting how many ships land at the same coordinate.

Additionally, even if we assume that the parsing was done correctly, the program counts occurrences of the float values in the list `test_list` instead of the actual computed coordinates.

Overall, due to the flawed processing of the arithmetic expressions and incorrect counting mechanism, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
