Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program attempts to read input expressions directly as floating-point numbers using `float(input())`. However, the input expressions are in the form `(a+b)/c`, which are strings and should be evaluated as expressions, not directly converted to floats. This will lead to a `ValueError` if the input format is not compatible with `float()`. The program should instead parse the arithmetic expression and compute the result from it.

2. **Expression Evaluation**: The program does not include any logic to evaluate the arithmetic expression `(a+b)/c`. It should first parse the input strings to extract the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, compute the result of the expression, and then store that result in `test_list`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**: The counting mechanism used (`test_list.count(i)`) is inefficient, particularly for large values of `m` (up to 200,000). It counts occurrences within a loop, leading to O(m^2) complexity, which is not acceptable for this problem size. A more efficient approach would be to use a dictionary to count occurrences in a single pass.

4. **Output Format**: While the program does format the output correctly by joining counts into a string, this is contingent on having the correct counts computed in the first place.

To summarize, the program fails to correctly read, evaluate, and count the jump coordinates according to the outlined problem description, making it incorrect.
