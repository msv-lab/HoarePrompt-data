The function accepts an integer `m` (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000) and reads `m` floating-point numbers from input. It then counts the occurrences of each unique floating-point number in the input list. Finally, it prints these counts as a space-separated string. The function does not validate the input for the arithmetic expressions specified in the comments.
