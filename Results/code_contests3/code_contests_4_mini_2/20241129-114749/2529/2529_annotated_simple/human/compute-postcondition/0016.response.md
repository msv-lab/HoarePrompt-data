`my_list` is updated by appending the count of `i` in `test_list`. Since `i` is the second floating-point number in `test_list`, its count is determined from the current state of `test_list`. The values of `m` and `test_list` do not change, only `my_list` is affected by the addition of the count of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `test_list` is a list of floating-point numbers; `my_list` is updated by appending the count of the second floating-point number `i` from `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `test_list` is a list of floating-point numbers; `my_list` is updated by appending the count of the second floating-point number `i` from `test_list.**
