The variable `e` is assigned the value `float(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `float` converts it to a floating-point number. The previous values of the affected variables (`m` and `i`) are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, and `e` is a floating-point number from input.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, and `e` is a floating-point number from input.**
