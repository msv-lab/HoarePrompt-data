The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it works with a variable `m`, which is an integer constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000. Additionally, the function utilizes jump coordinates that are arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.

Since the output details or behavior of the function based on the input values are not provided, we can only summarize the accepted constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000, and utilizes jump coordinates defined by arithmetic expressions of the form (a+b)/c, where a, b, and c are positive integers with up to two decimal digits.**
