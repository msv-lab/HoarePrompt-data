The code initializes an empty list `my_list`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `m`, `i`, and `test_list`, along with the new initialization of `my_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `i` is `m`; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers from input; `my_list` is an empty list.**
