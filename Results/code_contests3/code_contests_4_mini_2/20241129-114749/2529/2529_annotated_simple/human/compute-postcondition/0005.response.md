According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
