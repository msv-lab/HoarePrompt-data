`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000. After execution, `m` will hold the integer value provided by the user input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000; `m` is an input integer.

Output State: **`m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 200000; `m` is an input integer**
