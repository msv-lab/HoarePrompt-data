After all iterations of the loop have executed, the state of the variables will reflect that `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers, each obtained from user input. The variable `i` will equal `m`, since it increments with each iteration from 0 to `m-1`. 

If `m` is at least 1, the loop will execute `m` times, and `test_list` will contain exactly `m` floating-point numbers. If `m` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `test_list` remains empty.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `i` is `m`; `test_list` contains `m` floating-point numbers from input.**
