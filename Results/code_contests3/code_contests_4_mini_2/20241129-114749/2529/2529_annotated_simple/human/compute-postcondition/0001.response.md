The code initializes an empty list `test_list`. The variable `m` retains its value as an input integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, but is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `m` and the new state of `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `test_list` is an empty list**
