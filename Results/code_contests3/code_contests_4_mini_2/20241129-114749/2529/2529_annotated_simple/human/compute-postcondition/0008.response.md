According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be 2.

State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be greater than 1**
