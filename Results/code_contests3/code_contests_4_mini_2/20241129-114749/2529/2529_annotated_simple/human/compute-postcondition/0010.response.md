The code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `test_list` is not defined in the initial state, but we assume it exists in the context. The values of `m` and `i` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `m` and `i`, along with the addition of `e` to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000; `i` is 2; `test_list` has `e` appended to it.**
