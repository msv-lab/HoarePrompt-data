In this case, the code appends the value of `e` to the list `test_list`. The variable `m` remains unchanged, `i` remains 0, and the value of `e` is retained from input. The output state will reflect that `e` has been added to `test_list`, but we don't have specific details about the contents of `test_list` before the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `e` is a floating-point number from input, and `e` is appended to `test_list`.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 200000, `i` is 0, `e` is a floating-point number from input, and `e` is appended to `test_list.**
