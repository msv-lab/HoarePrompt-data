The value of `b` is decremented by `(k - 1)`, but the previous value of `b` is unspecified, so we cannot determine its specific value after executing the line of code. The other variables `k`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 2, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1).

Output State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 2, and `b` is decreased by (k - 1).**
