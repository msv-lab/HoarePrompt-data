Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, and `res` is 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)` while `a`, `v`, and `res` remain unchanged. If `b` is less than `k`, then `a` is updated to either `a - (b + 1) * v` (if `b` was initially greater than 0) or to `a - v` (if `b` was less than or equal to 0), and `res` remains 1 in both cases.***
