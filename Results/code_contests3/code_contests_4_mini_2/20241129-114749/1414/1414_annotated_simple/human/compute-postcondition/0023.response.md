Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, and `res` is 2. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by (k - 1). If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `b` remains unchanged and `v` is undefined. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - v`, where the exact value of `v` is unknown.***
