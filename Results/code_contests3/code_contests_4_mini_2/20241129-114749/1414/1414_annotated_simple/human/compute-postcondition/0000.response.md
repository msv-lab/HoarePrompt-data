The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned from the input, which is a space-separated string of integers converted to integers using `int`. The previous values of these variables are not specified, so they will now hold the integer values provided as input. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are now assigned specific integer values from the input.

Output State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input**.
