According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `a` must remain greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not directly affect the condition of the `while` loop.

State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, and `res` is 2**
