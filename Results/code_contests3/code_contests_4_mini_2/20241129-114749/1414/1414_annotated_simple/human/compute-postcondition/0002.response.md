According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` is an integer from input, but we do not know its value. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `a` must be greater than 0.

State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `b` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `res` is 0**
