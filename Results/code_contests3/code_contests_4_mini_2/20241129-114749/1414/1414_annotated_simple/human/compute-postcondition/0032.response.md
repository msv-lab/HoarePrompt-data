Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 3. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)`. If `b` is less than `k`, and `b` is greater than 0, then `b` remains unchanged and `res` is still 3. Otherwise, `a` is decreased by `v`, while `res` remains 3.***
