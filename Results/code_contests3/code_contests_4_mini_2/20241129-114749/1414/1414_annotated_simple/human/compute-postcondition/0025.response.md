`res` is incremented by 1, and since `res` was initially 2, the new value of `res` is 3. The values of `k` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 3.  
Output State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 3**
