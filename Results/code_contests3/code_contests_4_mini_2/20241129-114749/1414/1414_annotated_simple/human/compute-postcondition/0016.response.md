The value of `res` is incremented by 1. Since `res` is initially 1, after execution, `res` becomes 2. The values of `k` and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 2.

Output State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 2**
