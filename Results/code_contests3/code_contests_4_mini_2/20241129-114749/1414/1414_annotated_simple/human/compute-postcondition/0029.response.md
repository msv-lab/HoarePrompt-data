The variable `b` is assigned the value of 0. The values of `k`, `a`, and `res` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 3, `b` is 0.

Output State: **`k` is an integer from input, `a` is greater than 0, `res` is 3, `b` is 0**
