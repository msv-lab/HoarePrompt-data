#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `res` is the number of iterations executed, `b` is the final value after all decrements based on the conditions.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters: `k` (maximum number of sections in a box), `a` (number of nuts), `b` (number of divisors), and `v` (capacity of each section). It calculates the number of iterations required to distribute the nuts into the sections based on the availability of sections and divisors until all nuts are distributed. The function prints the total number of iterations required for all nuts to be accounted for. If there are no nuts left (`a` becomes less than or equal to 0), the loop terminates, and the function outputs the count of iterations.
