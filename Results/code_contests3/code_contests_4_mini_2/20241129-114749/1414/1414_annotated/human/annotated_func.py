#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer between 2 and 1000, a is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), b is a positive integer representing the number of divisors (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and v is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0, `res` is the total number of iterations executed, `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `v` is a positive integer.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: an integer `k` (between 2 and 1000), a positive integer `a` (representing the number of nuts), a positive integer `b` (representing the number of divisors), and a positive integer `v` (representing the capacity of each section of the box). It calculates and prints the total number of iterations required to process all the nuts based on the number of divisors available and the specified conditions, decrementing the number of nuts based on the values of `k`, `b`, and `v`.
