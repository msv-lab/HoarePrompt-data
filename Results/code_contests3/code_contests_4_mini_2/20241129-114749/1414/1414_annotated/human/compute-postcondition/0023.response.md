Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `v` is a positive integer, and `a` is greater than or equal to 0. `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is decreased by a value between 1 and 999. If `b` is less than `k` and greater than 0, then `b` is set to 0; otherwise, `a` remains greater than or equal to 0.***
