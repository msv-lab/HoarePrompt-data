The variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are each assigned values based on the input received from `raw_input()`, which takes a single line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each part into an integer. The previous states of the variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` were not specified, so they will now be assigned new integer values based on the input provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that these variables have been initialized with new integer values.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `a` is a positive integer representing the number of nuts (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is a positive integer representing the number of divisors (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), and `v` is a positive integer representing the capacity of each section of the box (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000).**
