Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `v` is a positive integer, and `b` is an integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. If `b` is less than `k`, and greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by (b + 1) * v, and `res` is increased by 1; if `b` is 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, and `res` is also increased by 1.***
