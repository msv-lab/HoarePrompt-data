The variable `b` is decreased by the value of `(k - 1)`. The value of `k` is between 2 and 1000, so `(k - 1)` will range from 1 to 999. The states of the other variables `v`, `a`, and `res` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `v` is a positive integer; `a` is greater than 0; `res` is increased by 1; and `b` is decreased by a value between 1 and 999.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `v` is a positive integer; `a` is greater than 0; `res` is increased by 1; and `b` is decreased by a value between 1 and 999.**
