The value of `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `b`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `b`. Other variables `k`, `v`, `a`, and `res` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `v` is a positive integer, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`.

Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `v` is a positive integer, `a` is decreased by `k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`.**
