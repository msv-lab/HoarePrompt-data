Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and `v` is a positive integer. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is decreased by `k * v` and `b` is decreased by `(k - 1)`, while `res` remains 1. If `b` is less than `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` if `b` is greater than 0, or `a` is decreased by `v` if `b` is 0, and `b` is set to 0, with `res` still being 1.***
