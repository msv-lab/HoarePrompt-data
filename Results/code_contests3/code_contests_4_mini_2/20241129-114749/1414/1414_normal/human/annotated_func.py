#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000) representing the maximum number of sections in a box, a is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) representing the number of nuts, b is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) representing the number of divisors, and v is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000) representing the capacity of each section of the box.
def func():
    k, a, b, v = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    res = 0
    while a > 0:
        res += 1
        
        if b >= k:
            a = a - k * v
            b = b - (k - 1)
        elif b > 0:
            a = a - (b + 1) * v
            b = 0
        else:
            a = a - v
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is less than or equal to 0, `b` is 0 or less, `res` is the total number of iterations executed, `k`, and `v` remain unchanged as integers within their specified ranges.
    print(res)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer inputs: `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v`, where `k` represents the maximum number of sections in a box, `a` is the number of nuts, `b` is the number of divisors, and `v` is the capacity of each section. The function calculates how many iterations are needed to distribute all the nuts, considering the constraints of sections and divisors. It prints the total number of iterations once all nuts are distributed. The function does not return any messages regarding the distribution of nuts, as indicated in the annotations.
