The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are assigned the values inputted by the user via `raw_input()`, which is split into a list and converted to integers. The previous values of the variables are unknown, but they must adhere to the constraints provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that these variables now hold specific integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 1000), `a` is an integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `v` is an integer (1 ≤ v ≤ 1000)**
