Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers. If `b >= k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `b` is greater than 0, `a` is updated, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, then `k`, `b`, and `res` remain unchanged while `a` is decreased by `v`.***
