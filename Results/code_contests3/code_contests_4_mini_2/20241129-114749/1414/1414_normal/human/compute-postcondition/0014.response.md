Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, while `a` and `v` remain unchanged, and `res` is 1. If `b` is less than `k`, and greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. If `b` is less than `k` and less than or equal to 0, then `a` is updated to `a - v`, while `b` remains unchanged, and `v` is an integer between 1 and 1000, with `res` remaining 1.***
