The variable `b` is assigned the value `b - (k - 1)`. The value of `b` is decreased by `k - 1`. The previous values of `a` and `res` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `res` is increased by 1, and `b` is decreased by `k - 1`**.
