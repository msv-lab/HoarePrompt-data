The variable `b` is assigned the value `0`. This change only affects the value of `b`, while the other variables `k`, `a`, `v`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is an integer, `a` is decreased by (0 + 1) * v, `b` is 0, `v` is an integer, `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`k` is an integer, `a` is decreased by (0 + 1) * v, `b` is 0, `v` is an integer, `res` is increased by 1**
