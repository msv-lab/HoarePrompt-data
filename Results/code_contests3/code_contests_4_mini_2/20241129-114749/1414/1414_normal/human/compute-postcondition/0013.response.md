Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers within the specified ranges. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is updated to `a - (b + 1) * v` and `b` is set to 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `a - v`, while `b` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `v` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `res` remains 1, with the condition that `b` is less than `k` and `b` is less than or equal to 0.***
