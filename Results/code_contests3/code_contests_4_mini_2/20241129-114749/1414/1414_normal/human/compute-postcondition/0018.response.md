The value of `b` is updated by subtracting `(k - 1)` from it. Since `k`, `b`, and `v` are integers within specified ranges, the new value of `b` becomes `b - (k - 1)`. The values of `a`, `res`, and `v` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, and `res` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is updated to `b - (k - 1)`, `res` is increased by 1**
