Postcondition: ***`k`, `a`, `b`, and `v` are integers. If `b` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `a` is updated to `a - k * v`, `b` is decreased by `k - 1`, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is greater than 0, then `a` is decreased by `v`, `b` is set to 0, and `res` is increased by 1. If `b` is not greater than 0, `a` is decreased by `v`, while `b` remains unchanged, and `res` is also increased by 1.***
