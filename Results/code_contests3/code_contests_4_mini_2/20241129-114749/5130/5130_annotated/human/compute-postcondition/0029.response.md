Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps` must have `comps[p[j]]` equal to 0, `col` is increased by 1, `j` is now `p[j]` (the new value of `j` is based on the value of `p` at the previous index), and `comps[j]` is set to `col`.**
