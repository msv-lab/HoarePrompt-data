The variable `col` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `comps` remain unchanged as this code does not modify them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`; `p` is a list of integers each decreased by 1 from the input values; `b` is now a list of integers from the input values; `comps` is a list of zeros with length `n`; `col` is 0.
