Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, and for the loop to execute again `comps[p[j]]` must be 0; `j` is now assigned the value of `p[j]`.**
