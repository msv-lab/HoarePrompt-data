Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps` has all elements corresponding to the indices followed by `p` set to 1, `col` is set to 1, and `j` is the last index accessed in `p` that resulted in a non-zero assignment in `comps`.***
