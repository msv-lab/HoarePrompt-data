The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is not provided. The variables `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `col` is increased by 1**
