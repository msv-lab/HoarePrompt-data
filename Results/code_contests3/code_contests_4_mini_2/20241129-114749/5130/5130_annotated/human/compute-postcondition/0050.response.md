Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 2. If `comps[2]` is equal to 0, then `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is equal to the final value of `p[j]` after the last iteration, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The loop continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0.***
