To determine the conditions for the loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the state of the variables involved in the loop condition.

The loop condition is `comps[p[j]] == 0`. For the loop to execute, the expression `comps[p[j]]` must evaluate to `0`. 

1. We have the following variables before the loop: `n > 1`, `i = 2`, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j = 2`.
2. The variable `j` is currently `2`, so we need to look at `p[j]`, which means we need to access the value of `p[2]`.
3. The loop will execute if `comps[p[2]] == 0`. This means that the value at `comps` indexed by `p[2]` must be `0`.

Since we don't have explicit information about the current values of `p` or `comps`, we must ensure that `comps[p[2]]` is `0` for the loop to execute. 

Thus, we can summarize that in order for the loop to execute, we need the condition `comps[p[2]] == 0` to hold true. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `comps[p[2]]` must be equal to 0**.
