The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous state indicates that `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` has been updated to `p[j]`. The other variables' states are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is updated to `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
