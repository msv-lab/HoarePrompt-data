Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, if `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps` contains all elements corresponding to indices followed by `p` set to the final value of `col`, `col` has been incremented based on the number of iterations, and `j` is now equal to the last value assigned through `p` before the loop condition failed.***
