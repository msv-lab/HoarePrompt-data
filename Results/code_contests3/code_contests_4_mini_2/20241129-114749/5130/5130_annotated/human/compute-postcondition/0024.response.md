The variable `j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `p`, `b`, `comps`, `col`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps` has all elements corresponding to the indices followed by `p` set to 1, `col` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, and `comps[i]` is set to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps` has all elements corresponding to the indices followed by `p` set to 1, `col` is increased by 1, `j` is 1, and `comps[i]` is set to `col`.**
