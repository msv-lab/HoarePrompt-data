The value of `p` is assigned a list comprehension that processes the input from `raw_input()`. Each value `v` from the split input is converted to an integer, and then 1 is subtracted from it. The variable `n` retains its value from the initial input, while `p` is now defined based on the new input. The variable `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `p` based on the new input and the unchanged values of `n` and `b`.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(raw_input())`; `p` is a list of integers each decreased by 1 from the input values; `b` remains unchanged.**
