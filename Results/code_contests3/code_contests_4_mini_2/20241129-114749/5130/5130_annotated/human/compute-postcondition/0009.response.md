`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of integers decreased by 1 from the input values, `b` is a list of integers from the input values, `comps` is a list where the first element is now 1 and the other elements remain 0, `col` is 1, and `j` is 0.
