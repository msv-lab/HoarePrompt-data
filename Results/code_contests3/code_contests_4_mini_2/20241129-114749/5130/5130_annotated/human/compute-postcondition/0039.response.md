`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, after execution, `j` will also be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2.  
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
