Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is the final value after all iterations, `j` is equal to the last value assigned from `p[j]`, and `comps` has been updated such that all indices reachable from the initial `j` in `p` have been set to the final value of `col`.**
