The variable `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The previous value of `j` is equal to `p[0]`, and since `comps[p[0]]` is 0, it indicates `p[0]` is an index that points to the value of `comps`, which is 0. Therefore, `j` will now take the value of `comps[p[0]]`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is equal to 0, `j` is 0, `comps[p[0]]` is 0**
