The code assigns the value of `col` to `comps[j]`. Given that `col` is equal to 0 and `j` is 0, the assignment results in `comps[0]` being set to 0. However, since `comps[0]` is already equal to `col`, which is also 0, there is no change to its value. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is 0, `col` is 0, `j` is 0, `comps[p[0]]` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is 0, `col` is 0, `j` is 0, `comps[p[0]]` is 0**
