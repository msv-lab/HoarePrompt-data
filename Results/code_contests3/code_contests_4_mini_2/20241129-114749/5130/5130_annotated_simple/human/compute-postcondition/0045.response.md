The value of `comps[j]` is assigned the value `col`. The variable `j` is determined by the expression `p[j]`, which is already known, but we don't have the specific value of `j` or `col`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[j]`, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[j]`, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`**
