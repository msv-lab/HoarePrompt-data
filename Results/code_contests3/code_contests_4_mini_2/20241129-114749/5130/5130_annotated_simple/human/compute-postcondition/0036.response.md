According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Since `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute for the second time as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
