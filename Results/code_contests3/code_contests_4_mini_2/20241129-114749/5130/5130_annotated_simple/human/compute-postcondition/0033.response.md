The code assigns the value of `col` to `comps[j]`. Since `j` is already defined as `p[p[1]]`, the value of `comps[j]` is updated to the current value of `col`, which was previously increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is now `p[p[1]]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[1]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is now `p[p[1]]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col**.
