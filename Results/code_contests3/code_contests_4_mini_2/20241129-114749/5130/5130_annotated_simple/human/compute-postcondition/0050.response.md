Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2. If `comps[i]` is equal to 0, then `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `j` is the final value of `p[j]` after all iterations. The loop continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0, indicating that multiple values in `comps` may have been assigned `col` during the iterations.***
