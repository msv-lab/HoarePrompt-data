The variable `comps` is assigned a list containing `n` elements, all initialized to `0`. The value of `n` is a new integer based on user input. Therefore, if `n` is a positive integer, `comps` will be a list of zeros with length equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a new integer from raw_input; `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 based on the input; `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length equal to the new `n`; `comps` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**
