To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop.

The loop condition is `comps[p[j]] == 0`. This means that for the loop to execute, the value in the `comps` array at the index `p[j]` must be equal to 0.

Now, let's look at the given state right before the loop:
- `n` is greater than 2 (this variable does not affect the loop condition directly).
- `i` is 2 (this variable does not affect the loop condition directly).
- `j` is 2 (this variable determines which index of `comps` is checked).
- `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, which has been increased by 1. 

The key point here is that `comps[p[j]]` needs to be 0 for the loop to execute. The current state indicates that `comps[2]` has a value of `col + 1`, which means it's not equal to 0 (unless `col` is -1, which isn't guaranteed). 

Thus, we need to adjust the value of `comps[p[j]]` to ensure that it equals 0 for the loop to execute. Given that `j` is 2, we need to ensure:
- `comps[2]` must be set to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time then comps[2] must be set to 0**
