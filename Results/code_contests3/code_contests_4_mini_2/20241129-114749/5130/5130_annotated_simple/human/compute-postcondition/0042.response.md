The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `j` is `p[2]`, and since `n` is greater than 2, `j` is a valid index in the `comps` list. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, and `comps[j]` is set to `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `p[2]`, and `comps[j]` is set to `col**
