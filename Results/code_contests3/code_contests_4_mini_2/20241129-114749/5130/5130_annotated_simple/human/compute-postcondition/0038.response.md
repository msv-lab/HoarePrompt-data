The variable `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `i` is 2, and `col` has been increased by 1, but its specific value is not given. Therefore, `comps[2]` is now equal to the new value of `col`. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col` which has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col` which has been increased by 1.**
