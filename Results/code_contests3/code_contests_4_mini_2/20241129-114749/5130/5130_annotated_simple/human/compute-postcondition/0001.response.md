The variable `p` is assigned a new list generated by a list comprehension, which takes the input from `raw_input()`, splits it into individual string elements, converts each of them to an integer, and then subtracts 1 from each integer. The value of `n` determines the length of the list `p`, but as `n` is being reassigned from `raw_input()`, we need to consider the new input value for `n`. 

Since `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, after adjusting for zero-based indexing, the values in `p` will be integers ranging from `0` to `n-1`. The length of the list `b` remains unaffected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `p` based on the new input taken for `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a new integer from raw_input, `p` is a list of integers from 0 to n-1 based on the input, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones with length equal to the new n**
