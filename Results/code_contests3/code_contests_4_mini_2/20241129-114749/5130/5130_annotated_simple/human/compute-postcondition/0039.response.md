`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, `j` will also be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col` which has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col` which has been increased by 1.**
