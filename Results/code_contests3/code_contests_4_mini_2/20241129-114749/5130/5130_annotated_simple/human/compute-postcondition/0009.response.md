`j` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The states of the other variables `n`, `comps[0]`, and `col` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is increased by 1, and `j` is 0.**
