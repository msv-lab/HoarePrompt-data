The value of `j` is updated to `p[j]`. The initial value of `j` is `p[2]`, which means `j` now takes the value of whatever is stored in `p` at index 2. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` may change depending on the contents of `p`, but since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, these values remain unaffected by the assignment to `j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is now `p[j]` (where `j` corresponds to the value at `p[2]`).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is now `p[j]`**.
