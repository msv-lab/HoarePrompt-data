The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), a list `p` that is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones of length `n`. It identifies the number of unique connected components in the permutation defined by `p` and checks the sum of the list `b`. The function returns 0 if there is only one connected component, and adds 1 if the sum of `b` is 0. Thus, the function effectively returns the number of unique components minus one if there is at least one component and increments the result by 1 if there are no 1's in `b`.
