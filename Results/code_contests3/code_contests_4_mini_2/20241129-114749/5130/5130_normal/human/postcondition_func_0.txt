The function accepts an integer `n`, a list `p` representing a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones. It calculates the number of distinct connected components in the permutation defined by `p` and checks if the sum of the list `b` is zero. The function returns 0 if there is only one connected component, the total number of connected components otherwise, and adds 1 if the sum of `b` is zero.
