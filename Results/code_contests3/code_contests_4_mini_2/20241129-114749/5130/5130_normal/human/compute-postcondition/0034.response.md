Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is the last updated value from the chain of `p` indices, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `comps[k]` for all values of `k` that were updated during the loop have the value of `col`, where `k` corresponds to all indices traversed in the loop until the first non-zero `comps` value is encountered.**
