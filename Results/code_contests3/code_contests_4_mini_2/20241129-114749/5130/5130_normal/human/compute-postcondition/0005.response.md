According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `comps` is initialized with `n` zeros, it is ready to hold values during the loop iterations. The variable `i` will represent the current iteration index and should start at 0 for the loop to execute its first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
