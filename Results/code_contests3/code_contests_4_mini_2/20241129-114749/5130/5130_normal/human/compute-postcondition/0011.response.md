The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. The current value of `j` is 0, so `j` will now hold the value of `p[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]`, and now `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]`, `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`.**
