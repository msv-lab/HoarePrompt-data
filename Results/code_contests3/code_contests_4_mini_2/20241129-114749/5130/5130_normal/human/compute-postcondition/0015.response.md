In the given code, `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The variable `col` is equal to `comps[0]`, and `j` is currently equal to `p[p[0]]`. Since `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, the value of `comps[j]` will be set to `comps[0]`. The variables `n`, `i`, and the specific values of `comps` and `j` do not change in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment that occurred.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is equal to `comps[0]`, `j` is now equal to `p[p[0]]; comps[j] is assigned the value of comps[0]**
