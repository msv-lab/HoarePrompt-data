`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `j` is 2, and `col` has been increased by 1. Therefore, `comps[2]` will be assigned the new value of `col`. The values of `n`, `i`, and other variables are not directly affected. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the new value of `col`, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the new value of `col`, `j` is 2**
