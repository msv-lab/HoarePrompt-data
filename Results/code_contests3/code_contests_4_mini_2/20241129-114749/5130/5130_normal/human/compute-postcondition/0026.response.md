The value of `j` is assigned the value of `p[j]`. Since the initial state specifies that `j` is 1, `j` will now hold the value of `p[1]`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are unchanged, but we need to note that `j` has been updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is now equal to `p[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is now equal to `p[1]**
