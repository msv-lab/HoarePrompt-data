Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0. If `comps[0]` is equal to `0`, then `col` is assigned the value of `comps[0]`, `j` is updated to the final value determined by the chain of indices from `p`, and `comps[j]` is set to `col`. The loop continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer `0`, resulting in `j` pointing to an index in `p` where `comps` is not `0`.***
