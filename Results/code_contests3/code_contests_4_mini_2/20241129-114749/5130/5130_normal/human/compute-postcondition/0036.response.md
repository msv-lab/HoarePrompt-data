According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Since `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again as long as `i` remains less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. 

For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`, which is already satisfied since `n` is greater than 0. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
