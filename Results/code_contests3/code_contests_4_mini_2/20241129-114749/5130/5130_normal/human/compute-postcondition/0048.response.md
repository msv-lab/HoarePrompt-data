The variable `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`. The previous value of `col` is unspecified but it is stated to be increased by 1. The previous value of `j` is also unspecified, but it is updated to `p[j]`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col.**
