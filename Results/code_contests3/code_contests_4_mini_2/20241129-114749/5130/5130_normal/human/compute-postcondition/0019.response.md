Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is equal to `comps[0]`, `j` is assigned the final value determined by the chain of indices from `p`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`. The loop continues until `comps[p[j]]` is no longer 0, meaning the final value of `j` will point to an index in `p` where `comps` is not 0.**
