The value of `comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. The value of `col` has been increased by 1, but we do not know its exact value. Therefore, `comps[i]` will hold the new value of `col`, which is unknown. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `comps[i]` is assigned the new value of `col` after it was increased by 1.**
