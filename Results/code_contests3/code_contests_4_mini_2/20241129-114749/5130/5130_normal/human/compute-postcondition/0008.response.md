`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`. Since `i` is 0, `comps[0]` will be updated to the current value of `col`, which is increased by 1. The previous value of `comps[i]` was 0, but now it will be equal to `col`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]**
