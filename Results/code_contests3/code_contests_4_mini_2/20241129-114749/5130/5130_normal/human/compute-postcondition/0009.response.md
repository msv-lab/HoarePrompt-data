`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 0, `j` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]`, and `j` is 0.  
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]`, `j` is 0**
