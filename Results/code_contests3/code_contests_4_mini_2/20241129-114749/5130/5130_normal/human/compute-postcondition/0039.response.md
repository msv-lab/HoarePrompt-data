`j` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is 2, so after execution, `j` will be 2. The states of the other variables `n`, `col`, and `comps[2]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`, `j` is 2**
