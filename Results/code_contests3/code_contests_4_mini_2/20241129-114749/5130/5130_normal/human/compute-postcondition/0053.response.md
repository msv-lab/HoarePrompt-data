The function `func` accepts two parameters: `p` and `b`. Parameter `p` is a list of integers that represents a valid permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). Parameter `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, with a length of `n`. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a single integer. The exact nature of this return value is based on the relationships and constraints defined by the inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `p` representing a valid permutation of integers from 1 to n and a list `b` consisting of zeros and ones, and it returns a single integer based on the processing of these inputs.**
