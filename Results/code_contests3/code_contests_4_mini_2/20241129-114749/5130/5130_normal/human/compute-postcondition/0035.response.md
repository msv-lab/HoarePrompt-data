Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. If `comps[i]` is 0, then `comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, and `comps[k]` for all indices `k` updated during the loop have the value of `col`, where `k` corresponds to all indices traversed in the loop until the first non-zero `comps` value is encountered.***
