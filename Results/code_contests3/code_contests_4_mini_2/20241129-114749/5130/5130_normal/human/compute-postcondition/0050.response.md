Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2. If `comps[i]` is 0, `col` is increased by the number of iterations the loop executed, and `comps[j]` is assigned the final value of `col`, where `j` is the last value assigned during the loop. If `comps[i]` is not 0, no changes are made to `col` or `comps[j]`.***
