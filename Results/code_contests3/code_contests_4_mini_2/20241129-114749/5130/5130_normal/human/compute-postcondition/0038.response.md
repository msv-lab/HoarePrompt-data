`comps[i]` is assigned the value of `col`, and since `col` is increased by 1, we don't have the specific value of `col` but know that it is greater than its previous value. The value of `i` is 2, so `comps[2]` will be set to the current value of `col`. The state of `n` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `col` is increased by 1, and `comps[2]` is assigned the value of `col`.**
