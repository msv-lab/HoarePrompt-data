The value of `col` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `col` is not given. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `comps[i]` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is equal to 0, and `col` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[i]` is equal to 0, and `col` is increased by 1.**
