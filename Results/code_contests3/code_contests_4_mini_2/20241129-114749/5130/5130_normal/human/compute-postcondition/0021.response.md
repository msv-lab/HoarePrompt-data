According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, so the loop can execute again. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
