`comps[j]` is assigned the value of `col`, where `j` is previously assigned the value of `p[0]`. The exact value of `p[0]` is not specified, but `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, and `col` has been assigned to `comps[0]`. Therefore, the value of `comps[j]` will now be equal to `col`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `comps[0]` is equal to `col`, `col` is equal to `comps[0]`, `j` is assigned the value of `p[0]`, and `comps[j]` is now equal to `col`.**
