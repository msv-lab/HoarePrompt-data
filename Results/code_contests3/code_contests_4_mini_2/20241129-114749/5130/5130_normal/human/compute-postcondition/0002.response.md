The code assigns the result of `map(int, raw_input().split())` to `b`. The `raw_input()` function accepts a line of input, and `split()` divides that line into separate string components. Each component is then converted to an integer by `map(int, ...)`. The variable `b` will hold a map object that produces integers based on the input provided. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new input integer; `p` is a list of integers derived from the input, each value is one less than the corresponding input value; `b` is a map object of integers from input.**
