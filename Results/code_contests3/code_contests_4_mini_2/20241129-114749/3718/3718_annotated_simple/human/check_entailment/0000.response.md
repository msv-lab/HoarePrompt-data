Correctness: **False**

The provided program only calculates the Euclidean distance between two cities based on their coordinates. It does not address the requirements of the problem description, which involves determining the minimum detection radius for a radar that can register the movements of the enemy rings surrounding the cities.

Specifically, the program lacks the following critical components:

1. **Inclusion of Radii**: The problem requires consideration of the radii of the enemy rings surrounding each city in order to compute the minimum detection radius. The program does not take these radii into account.

2. **Radar Placement Logic**: The program does not implement any logic to find the optimal placement of the radar based on the distances between the cities and their respective enemy rings.

3. **Output**: The problem specifies that the output should be a single real number representing the minimum detection radius, while the program simply returns the distance as an integer or floating-point number without any further computation.

In conclusion, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description and fails to compute the necessary minimum detection radius for the radar.
