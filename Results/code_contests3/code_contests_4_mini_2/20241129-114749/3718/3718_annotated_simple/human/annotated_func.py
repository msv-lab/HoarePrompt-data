#State of the program right berfore the function call: x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities, and the input also includes the radius of the flatland rings surrounding these cities, which are not explicitly included in the function's parameters but are implied to be part of the context of the problem. The absolute values of x1, y1, x2, and y2 are less than or equal to 10^4, and the corresponding radii are positive integers between 1 and 10^4.
def func_1(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    return sqrt((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2)
    #The program returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities defined by coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and it returns the Euclidean distance between these two points calculated using the formula for distance in a 2D space. The function does not consider any additional context related to the radius of the flatland rings mentioned in the annotations.
