Precondition: **x1, y1, x2, and y2 are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities, and the input also includes the radius of the flatland rings surrounding these cities, which are not explicitly included in the function's parameters but are implied to be part of the context of the problem. The absolute values of x1, y1, x2, and y2 are less than or equal to 10^4, and the corresponding radii are positive integers between 1 and 10^4.**
