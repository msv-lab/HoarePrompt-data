The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All these parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities defined by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the integer coordinates of two cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, and returns the Euclidean distance between the cities defined by the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).**
