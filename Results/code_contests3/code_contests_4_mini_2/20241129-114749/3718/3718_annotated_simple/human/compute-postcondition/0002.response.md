Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters representing the coordinates of two cities (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), and it returns the Euclidean distance between these two points calculated using the formula for distance in a 2D space. The function does not consider any additional context related to the radius of the flatland rings mentioned in the annotations.**
