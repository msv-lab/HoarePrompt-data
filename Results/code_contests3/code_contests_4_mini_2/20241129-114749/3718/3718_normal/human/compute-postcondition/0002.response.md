Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing the coordinates of two cities and returns the Euclidean distance between them. The function does not handle any edge cases related to the input values, such as invalid or non-integer inputs, but it is designed to calculate the distance correctly for any valid integer coordinates within the specified range. **
