The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. All parameters are integers representing the coordinates of two different cities. After executing the function body, it returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities located at the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integer coordinates for two cities and return the Euclidean distance between them.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2 (all integers representing city coordinates) and returns the Euclidean distance between the two cities.**
