To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description. The problem describes a scenario where we need to calculate the minimum detection radius \( r \) for a radar, given two cities and their respective distance to the enemy circles.

The program does the following:

1. It defines a function `func_1` to calculate the Euclidean distance \( d \) between two points (the cities).
2. It reads the coordinates and radius of two cities from the input.
3. It calculates the distance \( d \) between the two cities.
4. It initializes a variable \( r \) to 0.0 and then checks two conditions:
   - If the sum of the two radii \( r1 + r2 \) is less than the distance \( d \), it calculates the required radius \( r \) as \( (d - r1 - r2) / 2.0 \).
   - If the absolute difference of the two radii \( |r1 - r2| \) is greater than the distance \( d \), it calculates \( r \) as \( (|r1 - r2| - d) / 2.0 \).
5. Finally, it prints the value of \( r \) formatted to six decimal places.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Case 1:** When the cities are very close together, and the radii are such that they overlap significantly.
- **Case 2:** When one city is at the origin, and the other is far away with a small radius.
  
### Edge Case Examination

For the input:
```
0 0 1
1 0 1
```
The distance \( d \) between the cities is 1. The sum of the radii \( r1 + r2 = 2 \). Since \( r1 + r2 > d \), the program will not enter the first condition. The absolute difference \( |r1 - r2| = 0 \), which is not greater than \( d \). Thus, \( r \) remains 0.0, which is incorrect because the radar should at least be able to detect one of the circles at the edge.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle the case where the cities are sufficiently close (overlapping circles) because it does not return a positive radius when the circles are overlapping. Thus, the output will be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
