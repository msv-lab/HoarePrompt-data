Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum detection radius \( r \) such that a radar can be placed at some point to detect movements from two enemy rings surrounding two cities. This involves considering both the Euclidean distance between the two cities and the radii of the enemy circles surrounding them.

The annotated program function `func_1` only computes the Euclidean distance between the two cities based on their coordinates \( (x1, y1) \) and \( (x2, y2) \) but does not take into account the radii \( r1 \) and \( r2 \) of the enemy circles. 

To determine the minimum radius \( r \), the following must be considered:
1. The distance between the centers of the two cities.
2. The sum of the radii of the two circles (i.e., \( r1 + r2 \)).
3. The minimum detection radius \( r \) would need to account for the distance between the two cities minus the radii of both circles, or half the distance between the circles if they overlap.

The function fails to implement this logic and thus cannot provide the correct detection radius as required by the problem statement. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
