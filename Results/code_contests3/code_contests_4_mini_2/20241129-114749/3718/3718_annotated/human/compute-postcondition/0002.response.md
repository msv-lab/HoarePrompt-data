Functionality: ** The function accepts four integer parameters x1, y1, x2, and y2, which represent the coordinates of two cities, and it returns the Euclidean distance between these two cities. The function does not account for the associated radii of the cities (r1 and r2), meaning it strictly calculates the distance based on coordinates without any radius considerations. **
