To analyze the provided program based on the problem description, we need to ensure that the program correctly handles all valid inputs, specifically integers from 0 to 15.

The problem description states that the input is a single integer `a` in the range of 0 to 15 inclusive, and the output should be a single integer based on that input.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` to read input. However, `raw_input()` is a function from Python 2.x. In Python 3.x, it should be `input()`. If this code were to run in a Python 3 environment, it would raise an error since `raw_input()` is not defined.

2. **Indexing**: The program accesses an index of a predefined list based on the integer input. The list has 16 elements (index 0 to 15), which means that valid inputs from 0 to 15 will correctly map to an output from the list.

3. **Output Values**: The output values based on the provided list are:
   - For input 0 → output 15
   - For input 1 → output 14
   - For input 2 → output 12
   - For input 3 → output 13
   - For input 4 → output 8
   - For input 5 → output 9
   - For input 6 → output 10
   - For input 7 → output 11
   - For input 8 → output 0
   - For input 9 → output 1
   - For input 10 → output 2
   - For input 11 → output 3
   - For input 12 → output 4
   - For input 13 → output 5
   - For input 14 → output 6
   - For input 15 → output 7

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the scenario if the input is outside the range of 0 to 15 because it does not check if the input is valid before using it as an index. However, since the problem guarantees that `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`, we assume that the input will always be valid.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program fails to run in Python 3 due to the use of `raw_input()`, it is incorrect. The program does not handle cases where the input is not within the expected bounds (though the description states it will always be). 

Correctness: **False**. 

The specific case where the program does not work is when executed in a Python 3 environment, where it will raise a `NameError` due to `raw_input()` not being defined.
