The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; instead, it retrieves input through `raw_input()`, which prompts the user to enter an integer. The function is designed to print an element from a predefined list based on this input. The list contains 16 predetermined integers, and the expected input should be an integer within the range of 0 to 15 (inclusive) to avoid an `IndexError`. However, if the user inputs a value outside this range (negative integers or numbers greater than 15), the function will raise an error, as it does not handle such cases. 

Functionality: ** The function prompts the user for an integer input, and prints the corresponding value from a predefined list based on that input; it expects the input to be between 0 and 15, and will raise an `IndexError` if the input is outside this range. **
