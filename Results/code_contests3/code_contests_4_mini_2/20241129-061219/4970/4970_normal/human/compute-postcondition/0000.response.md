To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact step by step.

1. The code contains a list of integers: `[15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.
2. The `raw_input()` function is called, which would prompt the user for input, and the result is converted to an integer using `int()`.
3. The variable `a`, which is a single integer such that \(0 \leq a \leq 15\), is used as the index for this list.
4. Depending on the actual integer value of `a`, the corresponding value from the list will be printed.

Since the output of `print()` is not captured as a variable but rather displayed directly, we note that a value from the list based on the input will be returned.

Therefore, the output state should reflect the input integer `a` and the corresponding value in the list at that index.

Output State: **`a` is a single integer such that 0 ≤ `a` ≤ 15; the output is the value at index `a` from the list.**
