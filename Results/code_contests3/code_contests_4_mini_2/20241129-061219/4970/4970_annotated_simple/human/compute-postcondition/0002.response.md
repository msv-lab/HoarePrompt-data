The function `func` does not accept any parameters but relies on user input to select an index from a predefined list. The list contains integers, and the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then converted to an integer to index into the list. The valid indices for the input are from 0 to 14, as the list contains 15 elements (indices 0 through 14). If the user enters an integer outside this range (for example, 15 or greater, or any negative integer), an `IndexError` will occur since those indices do not exist in the list. 

The function does not have a return value; it only prints the selected value from the list based on user input. Thus, while the annotations hint at a parameter `a`, the actual implementation does not accept any arguments directly.

Functionality: ** The function prompts the user to input an integer, which it uses to index into a predefined list of integers. It prints the corresponding value from the list based on the input index, but it does not handle cases where the input index is out of range, leading to potential IndexError exceptions. **
