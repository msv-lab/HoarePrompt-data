Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. Specifically, the problem states that the program must take a single integer input `a` (where \(0 \leq a \leq 15\)) and produce a corresponding integer as output. However, the program uses a fixed list to output an integer based on the input taken from `raw_input()`, which is not properly defined in terms of its expected behavior according to the problem description.

Here's why the implementation is incorrect:
1. The program uses `int(raw_input())` to read input, which is not compatible with Python 3 (the correct method should be `input()`).
2. The output is derived from a hardcoded list with a length of 16, but it does not clearly show how the list relates to the input `a`. The expected output for an input of `3` is `13`, which is the fourth element in the list. However, there is no explanation or logic provided in the problem description that indicates this relationship.
3. The program does not have a return statement, and it simply prints the result instead of returning it, which may not align with the expected behavior of a function returning a value.

Due to these discrepancies, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem as described.
