To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem description and the program's behavior.

### Problem Description
The problem states that the input is a single integer `a` such that `0 ≤ a ≤ 15`. The output should be a single integer corresponding to the input based on some predefined mapping.

### Program Analysis
The program provided is as follows:
```python
print([15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7][int(raw_input())])
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` (which is for Python 2, but let's assume Python 3's input method is intended) to take an input, which is then converted to an integer and used as an index to access an element from the predefined list.

2. **List Structure**: The list is:
   ```
   [15, 14, 12, 13, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
   ```
   This list contains 16 elements indexed from 0 to 15. 

3. **Output Mapping**: The mapping from input integer `a` to the output integer is directly based on the index of this list.

### Potential Cases
We need to check if the mapping works for every integer from `0` to `15`:
- For `a = 0`, output is `15`
- For `a = 1`, output is `14`
- For `a = 2`, output is `12`
- For `a = 3`, output is `13`
- For `a = 4`, output is `8`
- For `a = 5`, output is `9`
- For `a = 6`, output is `10`
- For `a = 7`, output is `11`
- For `a = 8`, output is `0`
- For `a = 9`, output is `1`
- For `a = 10`, output is `2`
- For `a = 11`, output is `3`
- For `a = 12`, output is `4`
- For `a = 13`, output is `5`
- For `a = 14`, output is `6`
- For `a = 15`, output is `7`

### Conclusion
Since all possible inputs from `0` to `15` are accounted for, and the program correctly retrieves the mapped output for each input without any exceptions or errors, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
