Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not conform to the problem description in a key way. According to the problem description, the output should be a single integer based on the input integer `a`, which ranges from 0 to 15. However, the function directly takes user input and prints an element from a predefined list without returning the output or accepting `a` as a parameter.

The function uses `raw_input()` to get input, which is not specified in the problem description. Additionally, there is a mismatch in handling the output: the function prints the result but does not return it as an integer. The requirement is for the function to output a single integer, but it does not follow the expected function signature or return behavior.

Moreover, the list used in the function has a length of 16, and it correctly uses the input value as an index to access that list, but since it directly prints the value without a proper return mechanism, it deviates from the expected output format stipulated by the problem. 

For example, if `a` is 3, the function would output 13, which is correct, but it does so in a way that violates the requirement of returning an integer value. Thus, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
