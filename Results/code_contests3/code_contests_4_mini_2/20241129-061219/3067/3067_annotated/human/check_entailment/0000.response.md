The provided program is designed to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the length of the string `N`, the number of queries `Q`, the string `S`, and then the pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` for each query. This aligns with the problem description where `N`, `Q`, and string `S` are specified in the input format.

2. **Counting Substring Occurrences**: The program constructs an array `P` where `P[i]` holds the cumulative count of occurrences of the substring "AC" up to the `i`-th character of the string `S`. This is correctly implemented by checking each pair of consecutive characters in `S` to see if they form "AC".

3. **Handling Queries**: For each query defined by `(l, r)`, the program calculates the number of occurrences of "AC" in the substring `S[l-1:r]` using the formula `P[r-1] - P[l-1]`. This works because `P[r-1]` gives the total occurrences of "AC" from the start of `S` to `r-1`, and `P[l-1]` gives the total occurrences from the start to `l-2`, effectively giving the count of "AC" in the range `S[l-1:r]`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each query directly, which is in line with the requirement to output the counts.

5. **Indexing**: The program correctly adjusts for 0-based indexing in Python while the problem statement uses 1-based indexing.

The program does not contain any assumptions or errors that would lead to incorrect results based on the constraints provided in the problem description. It correctly handles the input format, processes the string to count occurrences of "AC", and efficiently answers each query.

Given this analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs as specified.

Correctness: **True**
