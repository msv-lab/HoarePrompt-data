`P[0]` is assigned the value 0. This assignment will not affect the values of `N` or `i`. The value of `P` is now defined at index 0, but the other variables are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `P[0]` is 0.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `P[0]` is 0**
