Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It counts the occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the string `S` and for each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, it returns the count of 'AC' substrings located between the `l`-th and `r`-th positions (inclusive of `l` and exclusive of `r`). The function does not handle cases where the input values for `l` and `r` might be invalid according to the constraints, as it assumes valid input is provided.**
