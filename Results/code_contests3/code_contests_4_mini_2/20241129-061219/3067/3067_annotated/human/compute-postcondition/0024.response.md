`P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, we need the value of `P[1]` to calculate `P[2]`. The states of `N` and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State depends on the value of `P[1]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 2; `P[2]` is `P[1] + 1`**.
