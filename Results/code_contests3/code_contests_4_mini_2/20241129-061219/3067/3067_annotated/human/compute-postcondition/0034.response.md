According to the code, the loop iterates `Q` times. The loop body has resulted in new values for `l` and `r` being assigned from the input, and the output is determined by the expression `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`. Since the loop has executed once, we need to prepare for the next iteration.

Since the loop has already executed once, we need to consider that the loop will execute again as long as there are still iterations left in `Q`. The loop variable `_` does not affect the values of `l` and `r`, but we need to ensure that `l` and `r` are provided new integer values from the input for the next iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `l` and `r` will be newly assigned integer values.

State: **`l` is a new integer value from the input, `r` is a new integer value from the input, for the loop to execute a second time there must be more input values remaining for `Q` iterations.**
