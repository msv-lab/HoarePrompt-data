According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, resulting in `i` being 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `N` must be greater than 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 1**
