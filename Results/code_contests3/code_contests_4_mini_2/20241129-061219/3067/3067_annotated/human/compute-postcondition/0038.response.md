The function `func` accepts a parameter `S`, which is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'. It also accepts a parameter `Q`, which is an integer representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, where `1 <= l_i < r_i <= N`. After executing the function body, it processes the queries on the string `S` and returns results based on these queries. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string S made up of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' and an integer Q representing the number of queries. It processes each query defined by two integers l_i and r_i and returns results based on the specified ranges in the string S.**
