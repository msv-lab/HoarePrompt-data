The value of `P[i]` is assigned the result of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, this means that `P[1]` will be set to `P[0] + 1`. The value of `P[0]` is not changed because `i` is not equal to 0, and the initial state indicates `N` is greater than 0, allowing the loop to continue. Since no specific value is provided for `P[0]`, it remains unspecified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `P[1]` is determined based on `P[0]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1; `P[1]` is `P[0] + 1`**.
