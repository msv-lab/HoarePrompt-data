Postcondition: ***If `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0, and `P[1]` is 1 as we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, if `S[i - 1:i + 1]` does not equal 'AC', then `i` is 1, `N` is greater than 0, `P[0]` is 0, and `P[1]` is 0 as we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.***
