The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on a string `S` of length `N`, which consists only of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where 2 <= N <= 100000. The function also processes `Q` queries, each of which consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, satisfying the constraints 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.

For each query, the function returns the count of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the substring defined by the indices `l_i` and `r_i` of the string `S`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on a string `S` and process multiple queries to return the count of specific characters within specified substring ranges. 

Functionality: **The function processes a string S of length N, and for each of the Q queries (defined by l_i and r_i), it returns the counts of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' in the specified substring.**
