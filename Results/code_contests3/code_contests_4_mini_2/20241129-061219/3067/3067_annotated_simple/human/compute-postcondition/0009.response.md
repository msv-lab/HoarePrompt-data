In the given code snippet, `P[i]` is assigned the value `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since it is stated that `i` is 0, this means that `i - 1` is -1. The value of `P[-1]` is not specified, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment that cannot be computed due to the unknown value of `P[-1]`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `P[0]` is 0, and the value of `P[-1]` is unknown; therefore, `P[i]` cannot be determined.**
