The variable `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string. The previous values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is assigned the first input value, `Q` is assigned the second input value, `S` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the first input value, `Q` is assigned the second input value, `S` is an input string**.
