The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `P[0]` is 0, and `P[1]` cannot be determined as `P[0]` is 0 if `S[0:2]` equals 'AC', and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
