The function accepts a string `S` composed of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' of length `N`, and a positive integer `Q`, which represents the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers, `l` and `r`, which define a substring of `S`. The function computes the number of occurrences of the substring 'AC' between the indices `l` and `r` (inclusive) for each query. It maintains a prefix sum array `P`, where `P[i]` contains the cumulative count of 'AC' occurrences up to the index `i-1`. The output for each query is the difference `P[r - 1] - P[l - 1]`, which gives the count of 'AC' substrings in the specified range. Notably, the function does not return counts of all characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' as stated in the annotations; it only counts occurrences of 'AC'. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` and a number of queries `Q`, and for each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in the specified range of `S`. **
