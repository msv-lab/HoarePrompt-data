#State of the program right berfore the function call: S is a string of length N consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where 2 <= N <= 100000. Q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, where 1 <= Q <= 100000. Each query consists of two integers l_i and r_i such that 1 <= l_i < r_i <= N.
def func():
    N, Q = map(int, raw_input().split())
    S = raw_input()
    P = [0] * (N + 1)
    for i in range(N):
        if i == 0:
            P[0] = 0
            continue
        
        if S[i - 1:i + 1] == 'AC':
            P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            P[i] = P[i - 1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0 and `P[i]` is equal to the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` up to index `i - 1` for `1 <= i <= N`.
    for _ in range(Q):
        l, r = map(int, raw_input().split())
        
        print(P[r - 1] - P[l - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is greater than or equal to 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 0, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1`, `P[0]` is 0, `P[i]` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` up to index `i - 1` for `1 <= i <= N; `l` and `r` are integers input from the user; the output is the difference of counts of 'AC' between indices `r-1` and `l-1` for each of the `Q` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It processes each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, returning the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` between the indices `l-1` and `r-1`. The function builds a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the number of 'AC' occurrences for each query.
