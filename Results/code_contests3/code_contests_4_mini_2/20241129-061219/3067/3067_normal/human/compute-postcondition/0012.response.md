Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, and `i` is 0. If the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 1` is equal to 'AC', then `P[i]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `P[i]` retains the value of `P[i - 1]`, which is 0.***
