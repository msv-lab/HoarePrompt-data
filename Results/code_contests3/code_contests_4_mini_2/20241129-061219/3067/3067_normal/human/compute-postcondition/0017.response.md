The value of `P[i]` is assigned the value of `P[i - 1] + 1`. Since `i` is 1, we are updating `P[1]`. Before this assignment, `P[0]` is 0 (as given in the initial state). Therefore, `P[1]` will be updated to `P[0] + 1`, which gives us `0 + 1 = 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `P[1]` is 1, `i` is 1**
