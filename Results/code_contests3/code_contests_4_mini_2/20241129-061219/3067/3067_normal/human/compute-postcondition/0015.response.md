The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that the execution will skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, `i` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
