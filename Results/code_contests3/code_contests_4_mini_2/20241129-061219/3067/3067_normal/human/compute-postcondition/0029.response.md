The code snippet reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. The `map` function applies the `int` conversion to each of the split values from the `raw_input`. The values of `l` and `r` are now defined based on the user's input, but their specific values are unknown at this stage. The other variables (`N`, `Q`, `S`, and `P`) remain unaffected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `Q` is greater than 0, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` where `P[0]` is 0 and `P[i]` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` up to index `i - 1` for `1 <= i <= N; `l` and `r` are integers input from the user.**
