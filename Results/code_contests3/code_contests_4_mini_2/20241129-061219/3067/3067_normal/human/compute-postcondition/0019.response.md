Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros and `P[0]` is 0. If the substring `S[i - 1:i + 1]` equals 'AC', then `P[1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `P[1]` is set to 0, and `i` remains 1.***
