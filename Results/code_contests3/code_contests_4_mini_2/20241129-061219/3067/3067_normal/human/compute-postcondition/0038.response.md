The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `Q`. 

- `S` is a string of length `N` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', where the length `N` satisfies the constraint \( 2 \leq N \leq 100000 \).
- `Q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, where \( 1 \leq Q \leq 100000 \).

For each query, which consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that \( 1 \leq l_i < r_i \leq N \), the function processes these queries accordingly.

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, so we will focus on what the function accepts. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`.**
