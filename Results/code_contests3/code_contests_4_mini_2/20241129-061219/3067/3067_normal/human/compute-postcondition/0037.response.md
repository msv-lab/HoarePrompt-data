Output State: **`N` is greater than or equal to 0, `Q` is greater than or equal to 0, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1`, `P[0]` is 0, `P[i]` is the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` up to index `i - 1` for `1 <= i <= N; `l` and `r` are integers input from the user; the output is the difference of counts of 'AC' between indices `r-1` and `l-1` for each of the `Q` iterations.**
