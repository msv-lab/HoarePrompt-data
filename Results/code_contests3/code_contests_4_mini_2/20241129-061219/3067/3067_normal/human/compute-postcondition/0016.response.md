Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `i` is equal to 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop without any changes to the variables.***
