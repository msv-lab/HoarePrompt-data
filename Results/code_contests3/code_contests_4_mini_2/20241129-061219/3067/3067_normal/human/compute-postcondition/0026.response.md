Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, `P[0]` is 0, if `S[i - 1:i + 1]` is 'AC', then `P[1]` is 0 and `P[2]` is 1 with `i` now equal to 3; otherwise, `P[1]` is 0 and `P[2]` is 0.***
