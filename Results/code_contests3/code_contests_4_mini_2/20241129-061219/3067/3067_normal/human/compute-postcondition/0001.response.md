The value of `S` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The previous values of `N` and `Q` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is assigned the first value from input, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user.

Output State: **`N` is assigned the first value from input, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user.**
