The code `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` assigns to `P[i]` the value of `P[i - 1]` incremented by 1. Given the initial state, `P` is a list of size `N + 1` initialized with zeros, and `P[0]` is 0. Therefore, `P[i - 1]` is the value at the index `i - 1`, which is initially 0 since all elements of `P` are initialized to zero.

Since `P[i - 1]` is 0, we calculate:
- `P[i] = P[i - 1] + 1` becomes `P[i] = 0 + 1`, so `P[i]` will be 1.

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` has its `i-th` index updated to 1, `P[0]` is 0, `i` is 0, and the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 1` is equal to 'AC'.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 0, `Q` is assigned the second value from input, `S` is a string input from the user, `P` has its `i-th` index updated to 1, `P[0]` is 0, `i` is 0, and the substring of `S` from index `i - 1` to `i + 1` is equal to 'AC'.**
