The function accepts a string `S` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T', and an integer `Q` representing the number of queries. It processes each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, returning the count of occurrences of the substring 'AC' in `S` between the indices `l-1` and `r-1`. The function builds a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the number of 'AC' occurrences for each query.
