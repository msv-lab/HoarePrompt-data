To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and check if it adheres to the problem description regarding the generation of Pythagorean triples.

The program has the following logic:

1. It reads an integer `n`.
2. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints -1 (indicating no Pythagorean triple can be formed).
3. If `n` is odd, it computes two values using the formulas:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
4. If `n` is even, it computes two values using the formulas:
   - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
   - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)

The program aims to print values `m` and `k` such that the triple (n, m, k) forms a Pythagorean triple. 

### Evaluation of the logic:

1. **Case when n = 1**: 
   - The program correctly outputs `-1`, as there are no Pythagorean triples involving 1.

2. **Case when n = 2**: 
   - The program outputs `-1`, which is also correct.

3. **Case when n = 3**: 
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = (3^2 - 1) / 2 = 4 \)
     - \( k = (3^2 + 1) / 2 = 5 \)
   - The triple (3, 4, 5) is indeed a Pythagorean triple.

4. **Case when n = 4**: 
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = (4^2 / 4) - 1 = 3 \)
     - \( k = (4^2 / 4) + 1 = 5 \)
   - The triple (4, 3, 5) is also valid.

5. **Case when n = 6**: 
   - The calculations yield:
     - \( m = (6^2 / 4) - 1 = 8 \)
     - \( k = (6^2 / 4) + 1 = 10 \)
   - The triple (6, 8, 10) is valid.

### Missing Logic / Edge Cases:

Let's consider a case where `n` is a large even number, say `n = 10^9`. The program will compute:
- \( m = (10^9)^2 / 4 - 1 \)
- \( k = (10^9)^2 / 4 + 1 \)

Both `m` and `k` will be valid integers, and in this case, they will be extremely large but still within the specified limits (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18).

However, there is an issue in the implementation of print statements for odd `n`. The program does not use a tuple correctly. Instead of using parentheses, it should directly call the print function with two arguments. The current syntax does not execute the intended print statements.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to execute correctly due to the incorrect use of parentheses for the print statements when `n` is odd. This means that for valid inputs where the calculations for `m` and `k` are expected, the output will not occur as intended.

Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not function correctly for all inputs due to the print statement issue. For example, if `n = 5`, the program will not print any output, which directly contradicts the problem description requirement.
