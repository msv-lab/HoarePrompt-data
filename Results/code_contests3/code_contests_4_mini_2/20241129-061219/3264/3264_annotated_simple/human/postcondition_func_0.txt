The function accepts a positive integer `n` inputted by the user, and if `n` is less than or equal to 2, it prints `-1`. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it prints two values: `((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints two values: `(n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1)`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results based on the conditions. Note that there is a potential syntax error in the print statement for `n <= 2`, as it lacks parentheses in Python 3. Additionally, the function does not handle input validation or exceptions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the input is not a valid integer.
