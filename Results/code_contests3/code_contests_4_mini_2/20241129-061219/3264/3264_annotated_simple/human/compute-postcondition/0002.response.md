The code `print - 1` is syntactically incorrect in Python as it will raise a `SyntaxError`. Therefore, the execution does not produce a valid output, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, and a SyntaxError occurred due to invalid syntax in print statement.**
