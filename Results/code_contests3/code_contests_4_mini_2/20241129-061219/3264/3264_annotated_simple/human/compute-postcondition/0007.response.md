The code includes a print statement that computes two values based on `n`. The first value is `n * n / 4 - 1` and the second value is `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can calculate the two expressions:

1. The first expression: 
   \[
   n * n / 4 - 1
   \]
2. The second expression: 
   \[
   n * n / 4 + 1
   \]

The values of these calculations depend on the specific value of `n`, but we can denote their outputs based on the calculations.

Thus, we have:
- The first value will always be slightly less than `n * n / 4`.
- The second value will always be slightly more than `n * n / 4`.

The overall output state will reflect the calculations based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer larger than 2; the output values are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`.**
