Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, a SyntaxError occurs due to invalid syntax in the print statement. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, the output values are `((n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)`. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, the output values are `(n * n / 4 - 1, n * n / 4 + 1)`.***
