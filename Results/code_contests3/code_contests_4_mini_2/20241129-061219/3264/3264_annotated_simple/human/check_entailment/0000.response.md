To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the program's behavior.

### Problem Summary:
The goal is to find two integers `m` and `k` such that:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` form a Pythagorean triple.
- `n` can be either one of the catheti or the hypotenuse.
- If no such integers exist, return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
The annotated program consists of the following logic:
1. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it prints `-1`.
2. If `n` is greater than 2:
   - If `n` is odd, it computes:
     - `m = (n * n - 1) / 2`
     - `k = (n * n + 1) / 2`
   - If `n` is even, it computes:
     - `m = (n * n / 4 - 1)`
     - `k = (n * n / 4 + 1)`

### Correctness Check:
1. **For `n <= 2`**: 
   - The program correctly returns `-1`, as there are no Pythagorean triples possible with such small integers.

2. **For odd `n > 2`**:
   - The formulas used for `m` and `k` derive from the properties of Pythagorean triples. Specifically, the generated values will satisfy the condition \( n^2 + m^2 = k^2 \) for valid outputs based on the definition of Pythagorean triples.

3. **For even `n > 2`**:
   - Similarly, the formulas also provide valid Pythagorean triples. They are derived from the even case properties of Pythagorean triples and will satisfy the condition of forming a right triangle.

4. **Integer Division**:
   - The use of `/` operator in Python 2 performs integer division when both operands are integers. However, the output format in the print statements does not ensure that the results are integers, especially for the case `(n * n - 1) / 2` when `n` is odd. This can lead to a SyntaxError in Python 2 and incorrect results.

5. **Output Limits**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if `m` and `k` exceed the required limits (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18). However, given the formulas and the bounds on `n`, the results will stay within the limits when `n` is within the specified range.

### Conclusion:
The program has a significant flaw related to the division operator and the potential for a SyntaxError. It does not correctly handle the output formatting or ensure that the results are integers, which can lead to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**  
The program does not correctly implement the output requirements as specified in the problem description, particularly in the handling of integer results and the potential for errors in output syntax.
