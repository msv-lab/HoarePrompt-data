The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and returns -1 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it outputs two values: ((n * n) - 1) / 2 and ((n * n) + 1) / 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it outputs two values: (n * n / 4 - 1) and (n * n / 4 + 1).
