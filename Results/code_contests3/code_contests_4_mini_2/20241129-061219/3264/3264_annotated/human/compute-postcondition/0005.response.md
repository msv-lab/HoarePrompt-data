The expression calculates two values based on the input integer `n`. The first value is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second value is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. Since `n` is an odd integer greater than 2, we can determine the results from the calculations.

Let’s denote the results:
- The first value will be `((n * n) - 1) / 2`
- The second value will be `((n * n) + 1) / 2`

Both expressions will yield integers since `n` is odd, making `n * n` an odd number, and both `n * n - 1` and `n * n + 1` are even.

Thus, we output the computed values as:
- First value: `((n * n) - 1) / 2`
- Second value: `((n * n) + 1) / 2`

Since we don't have a specific value for `n`, we leave it as is.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is greater than 2, and `n` is an odd integer; calculated values are ((n * n) - 1) / 2 and ((n * n) + 1) / 2**
