Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the output is -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, the calculated values are ((n * n) - 1) / 2 and ((n * n) + 1) / 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and even, the outputs are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1.***
