The code contains two expressions being printed: `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

1. The first expression calculates `n * n / 4 - 1`.
2. The second expression calculates `n * n / 4 + 1`.

Given that `n` is an input positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `n` is greater than 2, and `n` is an even integer, we can deduce that `n * n` is divisible by 4.

Let’s denote `m = n * n / 4`. The expressions can then be simplified to:
- First expression: `m - 1`
- Second expression: `m + 1`

Since `n` is even, `m` will also be a positive integer.

Thus, the output state will reflect the two calculated values based on the input value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input even positive integer greater than 2; the outputs are `n * n / 4 - 1` and `n * n / 4 + 1`**.
