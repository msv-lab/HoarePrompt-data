The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function body is not detailed, so we do not know the specific output. However, based on the constraints provided, we can infer that the function is intended to process this positive integer. Since there are no specific return conditions given, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
