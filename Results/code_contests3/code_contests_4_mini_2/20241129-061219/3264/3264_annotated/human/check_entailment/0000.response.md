The provided program aims to determine a Pythagorean triple that includes a specified integer side `n`. Let's analyze the program step by step in the context of the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` that must be in the range [1, 10^9].
  
2. **Condition for n <= 2**: 
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the program correctly outputs `-1`, since there are no Pythagorean triples involving sides of lengths 1 or 2. This matches the problem description.

3. **Odd n (n > 2)**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If so, it computes the values:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - For any odd integer `n > 2`, these calculations yield valid integers `m` and `k`, which will form a Pythagorean triple (n, m, k) because:
     - \( n^2 + m^2 = n^2 + \left(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\right)^2 = k^2 \)
   - Thus, the program correctly identifies a Pythagorean triple for odd `n`.

4. **Even n (n > 2)**:
   - If `n` is even, the program computes:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
   - For any even integer `n > 2`, these values also yield valid integers `m` and `k`, which form a Pythagorean triple (n, m, k) because:
     - \( n^2 + m^2 = n^2 + \left(\frac{n^2}{4} - 1\right)^2 = k^2 \)
   - This means the program again correctly identifies a Pythagorean triple for even `n`.

5. **Range of Output Values**:
   - The outputs for both odd and even cases are guaranteed to be positive integers within the limits specified by the problem, as the calculations ensure the results are always positive for `n > 2`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases like `n = 1` and `n = 2` by returning `-1`, as expected.

In summary, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly computes the required Pythagorean triples or indicates impossibility when appropriate. Therefore, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
