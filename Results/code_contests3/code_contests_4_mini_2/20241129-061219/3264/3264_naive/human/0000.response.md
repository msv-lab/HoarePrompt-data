To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, letâ€™s break down the program and analyze its logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find two integers \( m \) and \( k \) such that \( n, m, k \) form a Pythagorean triple, where \( n \) is the length of one side of a right triangle. The program must return \( -1 \) if no such Pythagorean triple exists.

### Provided Program:
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print - 1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer \( n \).
   - It checks if \( n \) is less than or equal to 2. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct since no valid Pythagorean triple can exist for \( n = 1 \) or \( n = 2 \).

2. **Odd \( n \)**:
   - If \( n \) is odd (checked with `n & 1`), the program calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \)
   - These calculations are based on the formula for generating Pythagorean triples when \( n \) is odd, specifically \( (n, m, k) \) where \( m = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) and \( k = \frac{n^2 + 1}{2} \).

3. **Even \( n \)**:
   - If \( n \) is even, it calculates:
     - \( m = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1 \)
     - \( k = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1 \)
   - This is also a valid method for generating Pythagorean triples when \( n \) is even, where \( (n, m, k) \) is formed as described.

### Potential Issues:
- The program uses `print` and parentheses incorrectly in the odd and even cases. The expressions should not be enclosed in parentheses like that; rather, they should be calculated and printed separately. 
- The program does not handle invalid cases properly for larger values of \( n \). For example, the calculations for \( m \) and \( k \) could potentially yield values outside the allowed limits, particularly due to integer overflow in languages with fixed integer sizes, but Python handles large integers well.
- The output from the print statements does not return the values as required by the problem description. Instead, it prints them directly which might lead to confusion.

### Example of Failure:
- For \( n = 3 \):
  - Expected output: \( m = 4 \), \( k = 5 \) (which it will return).
- For \( n = 1 \):
  - It correctly returns `-1`.
- However, for \( n = 67 \), the output should be `2244 2245`, which would not be calculated correctly with the incorrect print statements.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the parentheses around print statements and the potential confusion that could arise from the output format, the program does not adhere strictly to the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **False**. 
The program has issues with how it handles output and could lead to confusion when interpreting the results.
