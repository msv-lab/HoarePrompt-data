Functionality: ** The function reads a positive integer `n` from standard input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it outputs -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it calculates and prints two values: \((n^2 - 1) / 2\) and \((n^2 + 1) / 2\). If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints \((n^2 / 4 - 1)\) and \((n^2 / 4 + 1)\). The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results to the standard output.
