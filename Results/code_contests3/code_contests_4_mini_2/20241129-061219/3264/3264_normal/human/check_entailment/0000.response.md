Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description.

**Problem description:** The task is to determine if a given integer \( n \) can be part of a Pythagorean triple, where the triple consists of positive integers. The function should return two integers \( m \) and \( k \) such that \( n, m, k \) form a Pythagorean triple. If no such integers exist, it should return -1.

**Program:**
```python
n = int(raw_input())
if n <= 2:
    print -1
elif n & 1:
    (print(n * n - 1) / 2, (n * n + 1) / 2)
else:
    (print(n * n / 4 - 1), n * n / 4 + 1)
```

**Output hints:** The function reads a positive integer `n` from standard input. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it outputs -1. If `n` is greater than 2 and odd, it calculates and prints two values: \((n^2 - 1) / 2\) and \((n^2 + 1) / 2\). If `n` is greater than 2 and even, it prints \((n^2 / 4 - 1)\) and \((n^2 / 4 + 1)\). The function does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the results to the standard output.

### Assessment of the Program

1. **Case when \( n \leq 2 \)**:
   - The program correctly returns -1, as no Pythagorean triples can be formed with \( n \) being 1 or 2.

2. **Case when \( n \) is odd and \( n > 2 \)**:
   - The formulas \((n^2 - 1) / 2\) and \((n^2 + 1) / 2\) are valid for generating Pythagorean triples. For any odd integer \( n \), this will yield positive integers \( m \) and \( k \).

3. **Case when \( n \) is even and \( n > 2 \)**:
   - The formulas \((n^2 / 4 - 1)\) and \((n^2 / 4 + 1)\) should also yield positive integers for even \( n \). However, for \( n = 4 \), it results in:
     - \((4^2 / 4 - 1) = 4 - 1 = 3\)
     - \((4^2 / 4 + 1) = 4 + 1 = 5\)
     - Which gives the triple (4, 3, 5), a valid Pythagorean triple.

### Edge Cases
- The code does not explicitly check for cases where \( n \) is 2 or 3, but it handles them correctly by outputting -1 for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \).
- The code does not explicitly handle large values of \( n \) or check if the resulting \( m \) and \( k \) are within the defined constraints (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 10^18), which could be a potential edge case.

### Output Hints Agreement
The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the program. They match the calculations done in the code and confirm that the formulas yield valid results for \( n > 2 \).

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all described cases for the given problem and adheres to the expected outputs. However, it fails to ensure that the outputs for \( m \) and \( k \) fall within the range of 1 to \( 10^{18} \) for all inputs, especially for large \( n \). 

Thus, due to the potential edge case where the computed values exceed the output constraints, the correctness of the code is in question.

Correctness: **False**.
