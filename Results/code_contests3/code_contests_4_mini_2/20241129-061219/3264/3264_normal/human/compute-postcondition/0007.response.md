The code contains a print statement that outputs two expressions based on the value of `n`. The first expression is `n * n / 4 - 1` and the second expression is `n * n / 4 + 1`. 

Since `n` is a positive even integer greater than 2, we can calculate these two expressions:

1. The first expression: 
   \[
   n * n / 4 - 1 = \frac{n^2}{4} - 1
   \]

2. The second expression:
   \[
   n * n / 4 + 1 = \frac{n^2}{4} + 1
   \]

Both expressions are calculated based on the value of `n`, but since `n` is not specified, we cannot determine exact numerical results. However, we can note that both expressions will yield values based on the calculations.

The output state will include the expressions without specific values since `n` is only characterized by its properties (even integer, between 1 and \(10^9\), greater than 2).

Output State: **The first expression is \((n^2 / 4 - 1)\) and the second expression is \((n^2 / 4 + 1)\)**.
