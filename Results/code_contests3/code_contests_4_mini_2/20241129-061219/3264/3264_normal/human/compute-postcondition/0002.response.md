The code snippet is attempting to print "- 1". However, there is a syntax error in this code as the correct syntax for printing in Python should be `print(-1)` or `print("- 1")`. Since this code will result in an error rather than producing a valid output, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `n` is less than or equal to 2, and a syntax error occurs due to incorrect print statement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `n` is less than or equal to 2, and a syntax error occurs due to incorrect print statement.**
