The value of `n` is assigned the result of `int(raw_input())`, which means `n` will take the value that is entered as input and converted to an integer. The previous state of `n` is a positive integer within the range specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). Since `raw_input()` accepts user input, the new value of `n` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `n` is assigned a new input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9; `n` is assigned a new input integer.**
