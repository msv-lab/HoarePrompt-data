The code calculates two expressions based on the value of `n`. The first expression is `(n * n - 1) / 2` and the second expression is `(n * n + 1) / 2`. 

Since `n` is a positive odd integer greater than 2, we can denote it as `n = 2k + 1` for some integer `k`. Therefore, `n * n` will always be odd (as the square of an odd integer is odd) and thus both `n * n - 1` and `n * n + 1` will be even numbers.

1. The first expression, `(n * n - 1) / 2`, represents half of `n * n - 1`, which is guaranteed to be an integer since `n * n - 1` is even.
2. The second expression, `(n * n + 1) / 2`, represents half of `n * n + 1`, which is also guaranteed to be an integer since `n * n + 1` is even.

The output will be two integer values derived from the calculations based on `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `n` is larger than 2, and `n` is an odd integer; the results are ((n * n - 1) / 2) and ((n * n + 1) / 2)**
