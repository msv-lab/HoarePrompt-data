Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, a syntax error occurs due to an incorrect print statement. If `n` is larger than 2 and odd, the results are \((n^2 - 1) / 2\) and \((n^2 + 1) / 2\). If `n` is larger than 2 and even, the results are \((n^2 / 4 - 1)\) and \((n^2 / 4 + 1)\).***
