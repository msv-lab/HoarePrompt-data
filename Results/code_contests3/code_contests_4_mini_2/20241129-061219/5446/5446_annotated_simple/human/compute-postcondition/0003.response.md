The function `func` accepts no parameters. It uses the variables `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake respectively, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The function also accepts an integer `n` that must be between 2 and a + b (inclusive). The output of the function is based on the value of `n`. However, the specifics of the output are not provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100) and an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) to determine its output.**
