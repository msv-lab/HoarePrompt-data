The function accepts no parameters directly but reads three integers from input: `n`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then computes the ceiling of the product of one of the pieces (`min(b, c)`) divided by `n` multiplied by the previously calculated ratio. The result is printed as an integer. The function does not directly handle any edge cases regarding invalid or out-of-bound inputs.
