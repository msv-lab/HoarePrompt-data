The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters but operates under the constraints given for `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints specify that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\), where `a` is an integer in the range of 1 to 100, and `b` is also an integer in the range of 1 to 100. 

Since there is no output provided from the function, we cannot delineate specific return cases. Therefore, based on the constraints alone, we can infer that the function will operate within these limits but we cannot specify its output or behavior without further details.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b, where `a` and `b` are integers in the range of 1 to 100. However, there is no information on the return value or behavior of the function.**
