The variable `x` is assigned the value of `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`. The maximum value between `b` and `c` is computed, and then the minimum value between `b` and `c` is computed. The resulting maximum is divided by the minimum, and the minimum is converted to a float for the division. The values of `n` and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `x` is assigned the value of `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `x` is assigned the value of `max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))**
