Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers, `n`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is expected to be between 2 and the sum of two integers `a` and `b` (with `a` and `b` being between 1 and 100). It calculates the ratio of the maximum of `b` and `c` to the minimum of `b` and `c`, then computes and prints the ceiling of the product of the minimum of `b` and `c` divided by `n` multiplied by this ratio. The function does not have a return value; instead, it directly prints the result. **
