To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Distribute pieces of two cakes (with `a` and `b` pieces) across `n` plates.
2. Each piece must be placed on a plate.
3. Each plate must contain at least one piece.
4. No plate can contain pieces from both cakes.
5. Maximize the minimum number of pieces on any plate.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n, b, c = [int(x) for x in raw_input().split()]
    x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))
    print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))
```

1. **Input Handling:** The function reads three integers from input, which are expected to represent `n`, `a`, and `b` (though `c` seems to be used instead of `a` in the program). This mismatch indicates a potential error.

2. **Calculation of `x`:** 
   - The calculation `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))` attempts to find a ratio. However, this does not directly relate to the problem requirement of maximizing the minimum count of pieces on plates. Instead, it may misrepresent the distribution of pieces.

3. **Final Output Calculation:** 
   - The output `print(int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)))` is supposed to compute the maximum number of pieces per plate based on the defined conditions. However, it is not using the total pieces correctly, nor does it adhere to the conditions set out in the problem description.

### Key Issues:
- The function uses `b` and `c` but does not correctly utilize the `a` (pieces of the first cake) and `b` (pieces of the second cake) as separate entities. This leads to incorrect calculations.
- The logic for calculating how to distribute the pieces does not appear to maximize the minimum number of pieces per plate correctly. Instead, it seems to derive a ratio that does not correspond to the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Due to the incorrect handling of inputs and the flawed logic in calculating the maximum possible `x`, the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
