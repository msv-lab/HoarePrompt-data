To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq a + b \)
- `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake such that \( 1 \leq b \leq 100 \)
- `c` is an integer derived from the input
- `x` is calculated as \( \text{max}(b, c) / \text{float(min(b, c))} \)

Now, let's break down the code:
1. The expression `min(b, c)` determines the smaller of `b` and `c`.
2. Then, we compute the fraction `min(b, c) / float(n)`, which divides the smaller value by `n`.
3. This result is then multiplied by `x`.
4. The final result is passed to `ceil`, which rounds up to the nearest integer.
5. Finally, `int()` converts the result to an integer, and this integer is printed.

Since we do not have exact values for `b` and `c`, but we know their constraints, we can summarize the impact as follows:

- `b` is within the range of 1 to 100.
- `c` can take any integer value based on the input.
- `x` depends on the values of `b` and `c`, and it will change accordingly based on their values.

The output state will reflect the calculation involved in the expression, but without explicit values, we can't determine a specific output. Therefore, we express the output state in terms of the calculations that have been made.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100; `c` is an integer derived from the input; `x` is calculated as max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)); the result of the print statement is int(ceil(min(b, c) / float(n) * x)).**
