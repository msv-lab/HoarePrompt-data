The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq a + b\). The parameter `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, constrained such that \(1 \leq a \leq 100\). The parameter `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, constrained such that \(1 \leq b \leq 100\). 

The function does not explicitly return a value in the provided output details, so we have no information on the return value based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can only be described regarding the accepted parameters without further details on the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake (1 ≤ a ≤ 100), and b is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ b ≤ 100).**
