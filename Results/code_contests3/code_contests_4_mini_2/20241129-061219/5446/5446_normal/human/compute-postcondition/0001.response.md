To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the operation performed and the initial values of the variables.

1. `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, constrained between 1 and 100.
2. `c` is another integer derived from the input.
3. The code calculates `x` using the formula `x = max(b, c) / float(min(b, c))`.

Since `b` and `c` are integers, we first identify their maximum and minimum values:

- `max(b, c)` will evaluate to either `b` or `c`, whichever is larger.
- `min(b, c)` will evaluate to either `b` or `c`, whichever is smaller.

The calculation of `x` will yield a float since we are converting the result of `min(b, c)` to a float for the division.

Now, we can summarize the output state based on the values and the calculation performed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a` + `b`; `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake (1 ≤ `b` ≤ 100); `c` is an integer derived from the input; `x` is calculated as max(b, c) / float(min(b, c)).**
