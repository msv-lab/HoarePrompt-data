The function accepts three integer inputs (n, b, c) read from user input. It calculates the ratio of the maximum of b and c to the minimum of b and c, then computes the minimum of b and c divided by n multiplied by this ratio. Finally, it prints the ceiling of this value as an integer. The function does not directly accept parameters as argued in the annotations; it takes input directly from user input instead.
