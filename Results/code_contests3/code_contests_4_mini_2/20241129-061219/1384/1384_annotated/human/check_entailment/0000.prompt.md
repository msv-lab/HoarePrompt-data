You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: In order to pass the entrance examination tomorrow, Taro has to study for T more hours.

Fortunately, he can leap to World B where time passes X times as fast as it does in our world (World A).

While (X \times t) hours pass in World B, t hours pass in World A.

How many hours will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B?

Constraints

* All values in input are integers.
* 1 \leq T \leq 100
* 1 \leq X \leq 100

Input

Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:


T X


Output

Print the number of hours that will pass in World A.

The output will be regarded as correct when its absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}.

Examples

Input

8 3


Output

2.6666666667


Input

99 1


Output

99.0000000000


Input

1 100


Output

0.0100000000
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, and X is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100.
def func():
    t, x = map(float, input().split())
    print(t / x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers, T and X, through user input and prints the result of T divided by X. It does not validate the input for division by zero, which could lead to an error if X is 0. The expected behavior is to handle valid integers within the range of 1 to 100, but there is no explicit constraint in the code to enforce this.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
