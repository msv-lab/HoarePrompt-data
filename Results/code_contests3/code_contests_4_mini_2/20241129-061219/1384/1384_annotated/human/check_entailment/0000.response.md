Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Variable Names and Types**: The function uses `map(float, input().split())` which converts the input values to floats. However, the problem description specifies that T and X are integers. The program should use `map(int, input().split())` to comply with the integer constraint.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The output of the program is `t / x`, which suggests that it is calculating the number of hours that pass in World A as Taro studies in World B. However, according to the problem description, the correct calculation should be `T / X` (where T is the time studied in World B and X is the time ratio), and the function does not specify that `t` should represent T and `x` should represent X explicitly.

3. **No Input Validation**: While the problem description states the input constraints, the function does not check whether the inputs fall within the specified ranges (1 <= T <= 100 and 1 <= X <= 100). Although the problem guarantees valid input, good programming practice would enforce these constraints.

4. **Output Format**: The output should match the precision requirement stated in the problem description (absolute or relative error from the judge's output is at most 10^{-3}). The program simply prints the result, which may not adhere to the required precision.

In summary, while the program attempts to perform a division, it fails to correctly interpret the inputs, calculate the desired output based on the problem description, and enforce input constraints. Thus, it does not meet the requirements laid out in the problem description.
