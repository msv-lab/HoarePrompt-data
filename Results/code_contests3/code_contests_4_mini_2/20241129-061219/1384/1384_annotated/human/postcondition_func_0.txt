The function accepts two integers, T and X, through user input and prints the result of T divided by X. It does not validate the input for division by zero, which could lead to an error if X is 0. The expected behavior is to handle valid integers within the range of 1 to 100, but there is no explicit constraint in the code to enforce this.
