The values of `t` and `x` are assigned the result of `map(float, input().split())`, which means `input()` will accept user input, split it into two parts, and then convert each part to a float. The previous integer values of `T` and `X` are not affected directly by this operation since `t` and `x` are now assigned new values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `t` and `x` are now floats based on user input, and the previous state of `T` and `X` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= `X` <= 100; `t` and `x` are assigned new float values based on user input.**
