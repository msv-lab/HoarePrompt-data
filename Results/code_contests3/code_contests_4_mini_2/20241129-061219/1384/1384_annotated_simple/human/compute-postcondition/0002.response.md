The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate within the constraints that `T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100, and `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100, although these values are not passed directly as parameters. The output behavior of the function based on these constraints is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or functionality without further details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates under constraints for T and X, but the return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
