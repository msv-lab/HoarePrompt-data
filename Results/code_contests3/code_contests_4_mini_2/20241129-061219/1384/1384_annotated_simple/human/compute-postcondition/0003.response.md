Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters, reads two floating-point numbers from input, and prints the result of dividing the first number by the second. If the second number is zero, this will result in a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code. The function operates under the assumption that the inputs are constrained between 1 and 100, but this is not enforced in the code itself.**
