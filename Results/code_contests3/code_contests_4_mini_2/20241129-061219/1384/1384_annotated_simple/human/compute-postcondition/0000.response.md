The values of `t` and `x` are assigned the results of `map(float, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts two inputs and splits them into separate values, and `map(float, ...)` converts those values to floats. The previous values of `T` and `X` are not affected in this code, but `t` and `x` will hold the float representations of the input values. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; `X` is an integer such that 1 <= X <= 100; `t` is a float; `x` is a float**
