Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. According to the description, Taro studies for T hours in World B, where time passes X times as fast. Therefore, the number of hours that will pass in World A while Taro studies for T hours in World B should be calculated as:

\[
\text{Hours in World A} = \frac{T}{X}
\]

However, the code uses `t` and `x` as `float` values, which is unnecessary since the inputs are constrained to be integers. More critically, the print statement outputs `t / x`, which computes the correct mathematical result but does not handle the formatting required for the output.

The issue arises because the problem specifies that the output should have a precision of at most \(10^{-3}\), but the code does not ensure that the output is formatted correctly to meet this precision requirement. 

For example, if the input is `8 3`, the expected output should be `2.6666666667`, but if the output was formatted without consideration for decimal places, it might not meet the precision requirement.

Here's a simple case to illustrate:

1. Input: `8 3`
   - Expected Output: `2.6666666667`
   - Actual Output: Could be `2.6666666666666665`, which does not meet the required format.

Since the program does not guarantee the correct formatting of the output, it fails to satisfy the problem description fully. Thus, the program is incorrect.
