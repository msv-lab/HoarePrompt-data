The values of `T` and `X` are integers within the specified range, but after executing the code `t, x = map(float, input().split())`, the values will be converted to floats. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `t` and `x` are now floats, but we cannot determine their exact values since they depend on user input. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100; `X` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` and `x` are floats from user input.**
