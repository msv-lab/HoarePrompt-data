The provided program takes two input values, `t` (the number of hours Taro studies in World B) and `x` (the speed factor of time in World B relative to World A), and computes the number of hours that pass in World A while Taro studies in World B using the formula `t / x`.

### Initial Assessment
1. The problem description specifies that Taro studies for `T` hours in World B, and we need to find the equivalent time that passes in World A.
2. The formula `t / x` appears correct for calculating the time in World A since for every `t` hours in World B, `t / x` hours will pass in World A.
3. The constraints indicate that `1 ≤ T ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ X ≤ 100`, which means `x` will never be zero based on the input constraints.

### Edge Cases
- The program does not explicitly handle the case when `x` is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error. However, the constraints guarantee that `x` is at least 1, making this case irrelevant for valid inputs.

### Output Hints Evaluation
- The output hints state that the function accepts two integers `t` and `x`, calculates `t / x`, and prints the result.
- The hints also mention that if `x` is zero, it would raise a division error, but since `x` is constrained to be at least 1, this hint does not apply to valid inputs.

### Conclusion
Given that:
- The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.
- The constraints ensure that the input values will always be valid and will not lead to division by zero.

The code adheres to the problem description for all potential cases within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**.
