The function accepts two integers `t` and `x` as input values, calculates the result of `t` divided by `x`, and prints the result. It does not return any value. If `x` is 0, this will cause a division by zero error, but the function does not handle this case explicitly. Therefore, an edge case exists where the function may raise an error if `x` is 0.
