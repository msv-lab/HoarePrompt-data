Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the input constraints and does not produce the expected output format. Specifically, the problem description states that the input values should be integers, but the program uses `map(float, ...)`, which allows for floating-point inputs instead of strictly integers.

Additionally, the program outputs the result without any formatting to ensure that it has at least 10 decimal places, which is required per the problem's output specifications. For instance, if the input is `8 3`, the output should be `2.6666666667`, but the program may not format the output correctly to ensure it has 10 decimal places.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
