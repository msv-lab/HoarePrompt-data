To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
1. We need to check if there's a substring that can be reversed to make the entire string lexicographically smaller.
2. If such a substring exists, we should print "YES" and the indices of the substring.
3. If no such substring can be found, we should print "NO".

### Program Breakdown
1. The program reads an integer `n` (length of the string) and the string `c`.
2. A loop checks pairs of adjacent characters in the string (`c[i]` and `c[i + 1]`).
3. If it finds a pair where `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, it sets a flag and records the index.
4. If the flag is set after the loop, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the characters that can be reversed (specifically, `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`).
5. If no such pair is found, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Analysis
- The condition `c[i] > c[i + 1]` identifies a scenario where reversing the substring `c[i:i+2]` (i.e., the two characters `c[i]` and `c[i + 1]`) will result in a lexicographically smaller string.
- The program correctly identifies if such a pair exists and returns the appropriate indices.
- If the string is already in non-decreasing order, it correctly outputs "NO", indicating that no substring reversal can yield a smaller string.

### Edge Cases
1. For a string like "ab", the program would output "NO", which is correct since no reversal would make it smaller.
2. For a string like "ba", the program would output "YES" with indices (1, 2), and reversing "ba" gives "ab", which is indeed lexicographically smaller.

### Conclusion
The program fulfills all the requirements stated in the problem description. It correctly identifies when a substring reversal can produce a lexicographically smaller string and outputs the appropriate response.

Thus, we can confidently say:

Correctness: **True**
