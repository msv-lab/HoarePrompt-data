Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `s` is a string of length 2 to 300000 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, and `c` is an input string. If `flag` is True, indicating that there exists at least one index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, then 'YES' is printed along with `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. If `flag` is False, indicating that there does not exist any index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, then 'NO' is printed and `pos` is undefined.***
