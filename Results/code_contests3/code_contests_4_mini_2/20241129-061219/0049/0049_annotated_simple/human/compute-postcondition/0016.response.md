Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `s` is a string of length 2 to 300000 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters, `c` is an input string, and `flag` is True if the character at index `i` in `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` in `c`. If `c[i]` is greater than `c[i + 1]`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is set to 2.***
