Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string `c` of length `n`, where `n` is between 2 and 300000, and `c` consists only of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is at least one index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. If such an index exists, it prints 'YES' and the indices of the characters that form this pair (1-based). If no such index exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle input errors or cases where the string length does not match `n`. **
