The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and the parameter `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The function's behavior is not specified in terms of output in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value based on the given constraints and relationships. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 2 and 300000, and `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters.**
