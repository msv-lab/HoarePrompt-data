The variable `n` is assigned the value of `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input as a string, splits it into components, and converts each component to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` was an integer within the range of 2 to 300000, but now `n` will hold multiple integer values as a result of the input. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new condition of `n` and the unchanged state of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is now a collection of integers as a result of input; `s` is a string of length 2 to 300000 consisting only of lowercase Latin letters.**
