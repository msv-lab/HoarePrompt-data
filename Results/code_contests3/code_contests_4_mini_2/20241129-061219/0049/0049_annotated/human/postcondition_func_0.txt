The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is at least one character in `c` that is greater than the next character in the string. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of the last occurrence of this condition (pos + 1 and pos + 2). If no such characters exist, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but outputs the result directly.
