`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, and since `i` is 2, `pos` will also be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2.  
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `flag` is True, `pos` is 2**
