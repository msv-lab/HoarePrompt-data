Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1. If `flag` is True, indicating that there is at least one character in `c` greater than the next, `pos` is the index of the last occurrence of `c[i] > c[i + 1]`, and the program prints 'YES' along with the values (pos + 1) and (pos + 2). If `flag` is False, meaning there are no characters in `c` that are greater than the next one, `pos` is undefined, and 'NO' is printed.***
