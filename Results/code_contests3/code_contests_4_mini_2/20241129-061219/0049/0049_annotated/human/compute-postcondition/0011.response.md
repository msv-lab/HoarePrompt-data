The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True, and `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True, `pos` is 1**
