The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature, but it operates on two variables: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 300000\), and `s` is a string of length `n` that consists solely of lowercase Latin letters. 

The output behavior of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, I will summarize the functionality based on the constraints provided:

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The specific output behavior is not detailed.**
