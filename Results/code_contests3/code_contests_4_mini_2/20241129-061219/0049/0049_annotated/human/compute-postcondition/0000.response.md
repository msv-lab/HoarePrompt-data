The code snippet assigns `n` the value obtained from `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts those strings to integers, and then creates an iterable of integers. However, since `n` is already defined as an integer in the initial state, this line will overwrite its previous value. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values for `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an iterable of integers instead. 

Output State: **`n` is an iterable of integers; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters**.
