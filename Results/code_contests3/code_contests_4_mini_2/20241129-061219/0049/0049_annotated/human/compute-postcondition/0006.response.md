`flag` is assigned the value `True`. Since `flag` was initially `False`, it is now changed to `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `s`, `c`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c.**
