Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `c` is an input string. If the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`, then `flag` is set to True and `pos` is set to 1. If the condition is not met, `flag` remains False and `pos` is set to 0.***
