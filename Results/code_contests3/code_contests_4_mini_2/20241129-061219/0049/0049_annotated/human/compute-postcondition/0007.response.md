The value of `pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`; `pos` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n`, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`; `pos` is 0**.
