The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of determining if there exists a substring in a given string that can be reversed to produce a string that is lexicographically less than the original string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` and a string `c` of length `n`. It ensures that `n` is within the specified range (2 ≤ n ≤ 300,000), and `c` consists only of lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Finding Valid Substring**: The program iterates through the string `c` to check if there exists an index `i` such that `c[i] > c[i + 1]`. This condition indicates that reversing the substring `c[i:i+2]` (the two characters at indices `i` and `i+1`) will create a new string that is lexicographically smaller. 

3. **Output**: If such an index is found, the program outputs "YES" along with the indices of the characters that can be reversed. If no such indices are found through the entire string, it outputs "NO".

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies a scenario where reversing a substring can yield a lexicographically smaller string. The check `if c[i] > c[i + 1]` captures the necessary condition for reversal.
- The output correctly adheres to the required format, providing indices that are 1-based.
- The program accounts for multiple potential solutions by only needing the last occurrence of such a condition, which is sufficient to satisfy the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the criteria outlined in the problem description by identifying at least one suitable substring that can be reversed to produce a lexicographically smaller string. 

Correctness: **True**
