`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`, and `pos` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`, and `pos` is 0.**
