The `print` statement outputs the values of `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`. The variable `pos` represents the index of the last character in `c` that was greater than the next character. Given that `pos` is the index, `pos + 1` and `pos + 2` will yield the 1-based index of the characters in the string `c`. 

Since `n` is at least 2, `pos` must be a valid index within the string `c`. Therefore, after executing the print statement, the output will be the 1-based indices corresponding to `pos`:

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, `pos` is the index of the last character in `c` that was greater than the next character, and 'YES' is printed; the printed values are `pos + 1` and `pos + 2`.**
