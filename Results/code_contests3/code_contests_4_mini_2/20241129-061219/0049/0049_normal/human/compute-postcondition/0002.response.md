`c` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts a string input from the user. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input sequence, `c` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input sequence, `c` is an input string**
