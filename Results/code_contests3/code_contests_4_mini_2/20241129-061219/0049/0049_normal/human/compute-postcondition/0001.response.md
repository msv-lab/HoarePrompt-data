The value of `n` is assigned the first element of the list `n`, which contains integers obtained from `raw_input()`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 300000, the value of `n` is now the first integer from the input sequence. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input sequence.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input sequence.**
