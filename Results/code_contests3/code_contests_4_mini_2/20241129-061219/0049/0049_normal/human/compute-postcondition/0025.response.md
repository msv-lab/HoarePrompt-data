Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 300000) and a string `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there exists at least one character in `c` that is greater than the character following it. If such a character exists, it prints 'YES' along with the 1-based indices of the last pair of characters where this condition is met. If no such character exists, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints output to the console. **
