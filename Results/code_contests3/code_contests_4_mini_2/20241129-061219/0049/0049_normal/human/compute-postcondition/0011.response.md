`pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string, and `flag` is set to True; `pos` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an input string, `flag` is set to True; `pos` is 1**
