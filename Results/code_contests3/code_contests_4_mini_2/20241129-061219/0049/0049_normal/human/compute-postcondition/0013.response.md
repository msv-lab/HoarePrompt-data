According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is at least 2, `n - 1` is at least 1. This means that the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1.

After the current iteration, `i` will be increased to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is now 2, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 in order for the loop to be executed again.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
