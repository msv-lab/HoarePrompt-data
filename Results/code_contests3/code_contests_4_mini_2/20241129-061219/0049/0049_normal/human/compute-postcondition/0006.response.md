The variable `flag` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `flag` was `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `c`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `c` is an input string, `flag` is True, and the character at index `i` of `c` is greater than the character at index `i + 1` of `c.**
