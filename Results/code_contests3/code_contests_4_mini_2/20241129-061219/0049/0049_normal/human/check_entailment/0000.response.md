To assess the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the code and see if it handles all cases as expected.

### Initial Assessment of the Code
The program reads an integer `n` and a string `c` of length `n`. It checks for at least one instance where a character in the string is greater than the character that follows it. If such a character exists, it prints "YES" along with the indices of the last pair satisfying that condition. If no such pair exists, it prints "NO".

In terms of correctness:
1. **Finding a valid substring**: The program correctly identifies if there exists a character that is greater than the following character. This is necessary because reversing such a substring will lead to a lexicographically smaller string.
2. **Indices**: The program prints the indices of the found characters in a 1-based format, which is correct as per the problem description.

### Edge Cases
1. **All characters in non-decreasing order**: The program will correctly output "NO" when the string is something like "aabcfg", where no character is greater than the one following it.
2. **Two characters**: For `n=2`, if the string is "ba", it will find that `c[0] > c[1]` and return "YES 1 2". Conversely, for "ab", it will return "NO".
3. **Characters are the same**: For strings like "aaaa", it will also return "NO", which is expected.

### Review of Output Hints
The output hints suggest that the program checks for at least one character that is greater than its next. It also mentions that if such a character exists, it prints 'YES' along with the indices of the last pair where this condition is met. This aligns with the code logic.

### Conclusion
The code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. There are no indications that it would fail for any valid input as described.

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
