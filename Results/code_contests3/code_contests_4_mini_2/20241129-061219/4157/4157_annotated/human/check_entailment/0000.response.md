Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the issues in the program:

1. **Calculation of `t1`:** The formula used to calculate `t1` only considers the case when the trolleybus can reach the final station without needing to exceed its maximum speed `v`. It does not account for the scenario where a trolleybus might need to reach its maximum speed and then travel at that speed for the remaining distance. The calculation for `t1` should also handle the case where the trolleybus accelerates to its maximum speed and then maintains that speed until reaching the final destination.

2. **Handling of Trolleybus Catch-Up:** The program does not implement the logic to handle the scenario where trolleybuses catch up with each other. In the problem description, if one trolleybus catches up with another, they must travel together at the speed of the leading trolleybus. This means that the program needs to compare the time of each trolleybus with the previous one to determine if they will catch up and adjust their arrival times accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Output:** The program directly prints the calculated time for each trolleybus without considering the catch-up conditions. This can lead to incorrect times being printed if a trolleybus should actually arrive later due to a catch-up with a preceding trolleybus.

In summary, the program fails to account for the physics of acceleration, maximum speed, and the catch-up scenario as laid out in the problem description. Therefore, it does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the task.
