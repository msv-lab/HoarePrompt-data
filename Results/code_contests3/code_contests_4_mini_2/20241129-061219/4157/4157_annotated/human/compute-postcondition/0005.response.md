To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression for `t1` based on the initial values provided. 

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a positive integer
- `d` is a positive integer
- `t` is 0.0
- `i` is 0
- `ti` and `v` are assigned values from input as floats

The calculation of `t1` is as follows:
- If `d > v * v / (2 * a)`, then `t1` is calculated as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`
- Otherwise, `t1` is calculated as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`

Next, the code executes:
```
t = max(t1 + ti, t)
```
Here, `t` is updated to be the maximum of `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.

Since `t` initially is `0.0`, the value of `t` after this operation will depend on the value of `t1 + ti`. 

Thus, if we denote:
- `t1` as the result of the above conditions,
- `ti` as the input float value,

The new value of `t` will either remain `0.0` or become `t1 + ti` depending on the outcomes of the calculations.

Since we do not know the specific values of `ti` and `v`, we cannot specify exact numerical results. However, we can conclude that `t` will be updated based on these computations.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or `t1 + ti`, `i` is 0; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values; `t1` is calculated based on the given conditions.**
