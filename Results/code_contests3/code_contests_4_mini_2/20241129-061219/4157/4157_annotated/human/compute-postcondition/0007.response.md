According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again if `i` is still less than `n`. 

In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or `t1 + ti`, `i` is 1; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
