In this scenario, the code is simply printing the value of `t`. The value of `t` has already been updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value. However, without knowing the specific values of `t`, `t1`, and `ti`, I cannot provide a definitive value for `t`. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `t` has been updated and is being printed, but without specific values:

Output State: **`t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` and its previous value, and the value of `t` is printed.**
