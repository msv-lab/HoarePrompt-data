The `ti` and `v` variables are assigned the values from the input, which are parsed as floats. The previous values of `n`, `a`, `d`, and `t` remain unchanged. The only affected variables are `ti` and `v`, which take new float values based on user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or `t1 + ti`, `i` is 2, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either 0.0 or `t1 + ti`, `i` is 2, `ti` is a float input, `v` is a float input.**
