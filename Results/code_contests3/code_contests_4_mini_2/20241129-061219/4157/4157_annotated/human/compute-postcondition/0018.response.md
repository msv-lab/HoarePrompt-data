The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it uses external inputs which include `n`, `a`, `d`, and a list of trolleybuses defined by pairs of integers `(ti, vi)`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer related to some distance, and `d` is a positive integer related to time or speed. Each trolleybus is characterized by its departure time `ti` and maximum speed `vi`, where `ti` is a non-negative integer and must be in a strictly increasing order. After executing the function body, it will produce an output based on the calculations involving these parameters and the trolleybus data. 

Functionality: **The function operates on external inputs including a positive integer `n` representing the number of trolleybuses, a positive integer `a`, a positive integer `d`, and a list of trolleybuses defined by the pairs of integers `(ti, vi)`, where `ti` is the departure time and `vi` is the maximum speed. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
