The variables `n`, `a`, and `d` are assigned values from the input, where `raw_input().split()` accepts space-separated values and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `n`, `a`, and `d` are not specified, but they will now hold the values from the user input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new assignments based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from input, `a` is a positive integer from input, `d` is a positive integer from input, `t` is 0.0**
