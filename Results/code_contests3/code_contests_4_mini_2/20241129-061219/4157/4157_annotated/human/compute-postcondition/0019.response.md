Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `d`, representing the number of trolleybuses, acceleration, and distance respectively. It processes `n` pairs of floats representing the departure time and maximum speed of each trolleybus. For each trolleybus, it calculates a time `t1` based on the given formulas that determine the time taken to cover the distance `d` under acceleration `a` and maximum speed `v`. It keeps track of the maximum computed value of `t1 + ti` across all trolleybuses and prints this value after each iteration. The function does not have a return statement, indicating it only prints results without returning any final value. **
