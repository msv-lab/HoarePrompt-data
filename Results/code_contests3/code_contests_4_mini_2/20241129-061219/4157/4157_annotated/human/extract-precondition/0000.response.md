Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), d is a positive integer (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6); each trolleybus is defined by a pair of integers ti and vi, where ti is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) representing the time the i-th trolleybus leaves the depot, and vi is a positive integer (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6) representing the maximum speed of the i-th trolleybus; the sequence of times ti is strictly increasing.**
