Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where trolleybuses catch up to each other. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time `t1` for each trolleybus does not account for the scenario in which a trolleybus that departs later might catch up to an earlier one and thus needs to travel at the same speed for part of the journey.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2 10 100
0 10
5 15
```

In this case:
- The first trolleybus leaves at time `0` with a maximum speed of `10` m/s.
- The second trolleybus leaves at time `5` with a maximum speed of `15` m/s.

The first trolleybus will reach its maximum speed and will travel at that speed. The second trolleybus, which leaves later, will have a chance to catch up since it has a higher maximum speed. However, the current program would calculate independent arrival times without considering that the second trolleybus will catch up to the first one and travel together with it for the remaining distance.

Thus, the program fails to compute the correct arrival times for this scenario, leading to incorrect outputs. This shows that the logic is incomplete regarding the interactions between trolleybuses, confirming that the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description.
