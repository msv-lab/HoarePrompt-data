The function reads the number of trolleybuses, their maximum acceleration, and the distance to the final station. For each trolleybus, it calculates the time it takes to reach the station based on its departure time and maximum speed, taking into account the distance and acceleration. It then prints the maximum travel time for each trolleybus. The function does not handle any edge cases related to invalid input or conditions where no trolleybuses are provided, as the inputs are assumed to be valid according to the problem's constraints.
