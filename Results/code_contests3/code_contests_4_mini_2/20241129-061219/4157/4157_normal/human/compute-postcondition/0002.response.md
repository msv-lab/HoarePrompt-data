According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer, it is already guaranteed that `n` is greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `d`, and `t` do not affect the execution of the loop, but they are also present in the state before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
