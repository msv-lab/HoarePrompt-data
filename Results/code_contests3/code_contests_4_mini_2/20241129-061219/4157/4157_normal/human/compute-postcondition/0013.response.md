The values of `ti` and `v` are assigned from user input, where the input is split into two floats. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`) remain unchanged at this point. Since the specific values for `ti` and `v` are not provided, they are treated as user inputs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is updated to the maximum of `t1 + ti` or the previous value of `t`, `i` is 2, `ti` is a user input float, `v` is a user input float**
