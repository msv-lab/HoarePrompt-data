The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `d`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses, `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses, and `d` is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station. Each trolleybus has a departure time `ti` (where `0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6`) and a maximum speed `vi` (where `1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6`), with the departure times being strictly increasing. After executing the function body, it processes these parameters to determine the time it takes for each trolleybus to reach the final station based on their respective characteristics. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of trolleybuses), a (maximum acceleration), and d (distance to the final station), and processes the trolleybuses' departure times and maximum speeds to determine their travel times to the final station.**
