Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration of the trolleybuses (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), and d is a positive integer representing the distance from the depot to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6). Each trolleybus has a departure time ti (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and a maximum speed vi (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6), with the departure times being strictly increasing.**
