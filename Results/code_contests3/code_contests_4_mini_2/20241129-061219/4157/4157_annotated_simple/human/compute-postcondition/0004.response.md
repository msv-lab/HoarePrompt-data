To determine the output state, we start by analyzing the code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `a` is a positive integer
- `d` is a positive integer
- `t` is 0.0
- `i` is 0
- `ti` and `v` are assigned values from `raw_input()` split and converted to floats.

The code uses a conditional expression to compute `t1`:
```
t1 = v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v if d > v * v / (2 * a) else math.sqrt(2 * d / a)
```

To compute `t1`, we need to evaluate the condition `d > v * v / (2 * a)`. Depending on whether this condition is true or false, we will have different computations for `t1`.

1. If `d > v * v / (2 * a)` is true:
   - We compute `t1` as `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`.

2. If `d <= v * v / (2 * a)` is false:
   - We compute `t1` as `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since `n`, `a`, `d`, and `t` are not directly modified by this operation, and `i` remains 0, the output state will depend on the computed value of `t1`.

As we do not know the specific values for `v`, `a`, and `d`, we cannot compute a numerical value for `t1`, but we can denote its dependency on the conditions stated above.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is 0.0, `i` is 0, `t1` is either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d > v * v / (2 * a)` or `math.sqrt(2 * d / a` otherwise.**
