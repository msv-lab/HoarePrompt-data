The function `func` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `d`, along with a list of tuples for each trolleybus where each tuple contains `ti` and `vi`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of trolleybuses (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6).
- `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6).
- Each trolleybus has a departure time `ti`, which is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6), and a maximum speed `vi`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6). The departure times `ti` are strictly increasing for each trolleybus.

The function processes these inputs and returns the time at which the last trolleybus reaches the final station. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and d, along with a list of tuples (ti, vi) for each trolleybus, and returns the time at which the last trolleybus reaches the final station.**
