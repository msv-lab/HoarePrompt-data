To determine the output state after running the provided Python code snippet, we start with the initial state and analyze the effect of the code.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2,
- `a` is a positive integer,
- `d` is a positive integer,
- `t` is either `max(t1 + t, 0.0)` or `max(math.sqrt(2 * d / a) + t, 0.0)`,
- `i` is 2,
- `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input,
- `t1` is either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d > v * v / (2 * a)` or `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)` otherwise,
- `t` is updated to `max(t1 + ti, t)`.

The provided code snippet:
```
ti, v = map(float, raw_input().split())
```
This line takes input from the user and splits it into two float values, which are assigned to `ti` and `v`. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged at this point.

Since `ti` and `v` are now assigned float values from input, the previous values of these variables are not known.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of the float values to `ti` and `v`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `a` is a positive integer; `d` is a positive integer; `t` is either `max(t1 + t, 0.0)` or `max(math.sqrt(2 * d / a) + t, 0.0)`; `i` is 2; `ti` is an input float; `v` is an input float.**
