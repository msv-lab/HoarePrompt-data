To determine the output state, we analyze the code provided.

1. The variable `t` is assigned the maximum value between `t1 + ti` and the current value of `t`.
2. The value of `t1` is determined based on the conditions involving `v`, `a`, and `d`. 
3. `ti` is an input float which influences the calculation of `t`.
4. The initial state indicates that `n`, `a`, `d`, and `t` have specific values based on their definitions, while `i` is set to 2.

Given that `t` can be either `max(t1 + t, 0.0)` or `max(math.sqrt(2 * d / a) + t, 0.0)`, and considering the calculation of `t1`, the final value of `t` will depend on the values of `t1` and `ti` as well as the original value of `t`.

Since we are not provided with specific numerical values for `t1`, `ti`, and `t`, we cannot determine the numeric result but can state the relationship.

The output state will reflect the calculation of `t` based on its potential values without exact numeric results, as it involves the input float `ti` and the calculations based on `t1`.

Output State: **`t` is assigned the value max(t1 + ti, t) where `t1` is either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d > v * v / (2 * a)` else `math.sqrt(2 * d / a`, and `ti` is an input float.**
