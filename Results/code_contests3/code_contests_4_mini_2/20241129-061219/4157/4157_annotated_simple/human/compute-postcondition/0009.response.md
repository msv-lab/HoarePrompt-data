The variable `t1` is assigned a value based on the condition involving `d`, `v`, and `a`. Depending on whether `d` is greater than `v * v / (2 * a)` or not, `t1` is calculated either using the first formula or the second.

1. If `d > v * v / (2 * a)`:
   - `t1` is assigned the value `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v`. 
2. If `d <= v * v / (2 * a)`:
   - `t1` is assigned the value `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)`.

Since `n`, `a`, `d`, `t`, `i`, `ti`, and `v` are not directly affected by this calculation, we only update `t1`. 

Given that `t1` will take on a specific value based on the condition evaluated, we reflect that in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either `max(t1 + t, 0.0)` or `max(math.sqrt(2 * d / a) + t, 0.0)`, `i` is 1; `ti` and `v` are assigned float values from input; `t1` is either `v / a + (d - v * v / (2 * a)) / v` if `d > v * v / (2 * a)` or `math.sqrt(2 * d / a)` otherwise.**
