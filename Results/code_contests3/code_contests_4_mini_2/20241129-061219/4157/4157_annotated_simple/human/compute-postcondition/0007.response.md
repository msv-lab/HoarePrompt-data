According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1. Therefore, the updated value of `i` will be 1. 

For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1, since `i` will have the value of 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a positive integer, `d` is a positive integer, `t` is either `max(t1 + t, 0.0)` or `max(math.sqrt(2 * d / a) + t, 0.0)`, `i` is 1, and the value of `t` is printed.**
