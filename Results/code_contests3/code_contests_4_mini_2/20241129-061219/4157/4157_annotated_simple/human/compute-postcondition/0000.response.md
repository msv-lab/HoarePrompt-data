Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a positive integer representing the maximum acceleration (1 ≤ a ≤ 10^6), `d` is a positive integer representing the distance to the final station (1 ≤ d ≤ 10^6), for each trolleybus, `ti` is a non-negative integer representing the time of departure (0 ≤ ti ≤ 10^6) and `vi` is a positive integer representing the maximum speed (1 ≤ vi ≤ 10^6); the times `ti` are strictly increasing for each trolleybus; `t` is 0.0.**
