To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description:
1. Given a text of single-space separated words.
2. The volume of a word is defined as the number of capital letters in that word.
3. The volume of the text is the maximum volume of all words in the text.
4. Input includes:
   - An integer `n` which is the length of the text.
   - A second line containing the actual text.
5. The output should be a single integer representing the volume of the text.

### Program Analysis:
```python
raw_input()
l = raw_input().split()
m = 0
for i in l:
    s = 0
    for j in i:
        if j.isupper():
            s += 1
    m = max(s, m)
print(m)
```

1. The first `raw_input()` reads the length of the text but does not store it, which is not needed for the implementation.
2. The second `raw_input()` reads the actual text and splits it into words using `split()`.
3. The program initializes `m` to zero.
4. It iterates over each word `i` in the list of words `l`.
5. For each word, it initializes `s` to zero and counts the number of uppercase letters by iterating over each character `j` in the word.
6. It updates `m` to be the maximum of the current word's uppercase count `s` and the previous maximum `m`.
7. Finally, it prints `m`, which is the maximum volume of the words.

### Test Cases to Consider:
1. **Single Word with All Uppercase:**
   - Input: `5` (length) + `HELLO`
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - The program correctly counts 5 uppercase letters.

2. **Single Word with No Uppercase:**
   - Input: `4` (length) + `test`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly counts 0 uppercase letters.

3. **Multiple Words with Mixed Cases:**
   - Input: `24` (length) + `Hello World`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - The program counts 1 uppercase letter in "Hello" and 1 in "World", taking the maximum which is 1.

4. **No Uppercase Letters:**
   - Input: `24` (length) + `this is zero answer text`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - The program correctly counts 0 uppercase letters across all words.

5. **Edge Case - All Uppercase Words:**
   - Input: `20` (length) + `THIS IS A TEST`
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - The program correctly counts 4 uppercase letters in total.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully implements the logic defined in the problem description. It counts the uppercase letters in each word correctly and finds the maximum volume among all words. 

**Correctness: **True**.** The program handles all provided cases and edge cases correctly.
