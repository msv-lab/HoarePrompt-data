Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 1, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in `l`, and `j` is the next character in string `i`. If `j` is an uppercase character, `s` is incremented by 1. If `j` is not an uppercase character, `s` remains unchanged.***
