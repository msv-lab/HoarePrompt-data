The `raw_input()` function is typically used to take input from the user. However, in Python 3, it has been replaced by `input()`. Assuming the context is Python 2, `raw_input()` will read a line from input, which will not affect the existing variables `n` or any other variables. The output state remains unchanged in terms of the variable values, but we are aware that an input is being taken. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; an input string has been requested but not stored or processed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; an input string has been requested but not stored or processed.**
