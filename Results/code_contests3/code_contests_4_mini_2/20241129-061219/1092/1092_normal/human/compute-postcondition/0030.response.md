`m` is assigned the value `max(s, m)`. The value of `s` is the count of uppercase letters in the string `i`, and `m` is already defined as `max(s, 0)`. The impact of this code is that `m` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `s`. Since `s` is non-negative, `m` will either remain the same or increase based on the value of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to max(s, m), `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to max(s, m), `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in `l`, `s` is the count of uppercase letters in `i**.
