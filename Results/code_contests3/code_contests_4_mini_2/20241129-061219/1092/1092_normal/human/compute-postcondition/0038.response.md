The value of `s` is incremented by 1. Since the previous value of `s` is not explicitly stated in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact new value of `s`, but we know it has increased by 1. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to max(s, m), `l` is a list of strings containing at least 3 strings, `i` is the third string in the list and is not an empty string, and `j` is set to the second character of `i`.
