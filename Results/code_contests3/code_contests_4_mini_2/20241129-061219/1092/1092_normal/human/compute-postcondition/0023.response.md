According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is a string that represents the current character in `i`.

Since `i` is the second string in the list `l`, and `l` contains at least 2 strings, we know that `i` has at least 1 character. To determine the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to know the length of `i` and the current value of `j`.

If `j` has been assigned the last character in `i`, then the loop will not execute again. However, since `i` has at least 1 character, and since `j` is the current character in the loop, the next value of `j` will be the next character in `i`.

To summarize, the state must be adjusted to reflect the next character in the string `i`. If `j` is currently the first character of `i`, in the next iteration, `j` will be the second character, and so on.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 1, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is the next character in string `i`.**
