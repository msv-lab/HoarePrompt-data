`m` is assigned the value `0`, and the assignment does not affect the values of `n` or `l`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input string; `m` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input string; `m` is 0**.
