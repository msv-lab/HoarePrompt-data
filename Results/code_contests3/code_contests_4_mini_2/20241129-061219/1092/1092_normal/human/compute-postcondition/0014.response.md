Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 2 characters, and `j` is the next character in the string `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
