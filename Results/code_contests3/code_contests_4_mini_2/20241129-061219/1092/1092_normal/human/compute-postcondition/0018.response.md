The value of `s` is assigned to 0, which resets its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is max(s, 0); `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings; `i` is the second string in `l`; `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is max(s, 0); `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings; `i` is the second string in `l`; `s` is 0.**
