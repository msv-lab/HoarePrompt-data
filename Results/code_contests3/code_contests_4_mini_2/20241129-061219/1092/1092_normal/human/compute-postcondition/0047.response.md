The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `words`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200. The parameter `words` is a string consisting of single-space separated words made up of small and capital Latin letters. After executing the function body, it processes these inputs and produces an output based on the input criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `words` (single-space separated words of Latin letters), performing operations based on these inputs and returning a result accordingly.**
