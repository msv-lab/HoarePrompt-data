The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is a string that is uppercase.
