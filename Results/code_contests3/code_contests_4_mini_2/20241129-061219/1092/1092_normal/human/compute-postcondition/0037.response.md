According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `i` being iterated over. Since `i` is the third string in the list `l`, and `l` contains at least 3 strings, the loop can execute for each character in `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the first character of `i`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must take the next character in `i`. Assuming `i` has at least 2 characters, if the current character is the first character, then for the loop to execute again, `j` will be set to the second character of `i`. 

Thus, the state must be adjusted to reflect the next character in `i`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to max(s, m), `l` is a list of strings containing at least 3 strings, `i` is the third string in the list and is not an empty string, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be set to the second character of `i`.**
