The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so `s` changes from 1 to 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 2 characters, `s` is 2, and `j` is the next character in the string `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in `l` with at least 2 characters, `s` is 2, and `j` is the next character in the string `i`.**
