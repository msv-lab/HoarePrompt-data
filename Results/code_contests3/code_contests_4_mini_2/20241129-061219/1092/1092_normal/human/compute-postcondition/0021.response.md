The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is max(s, 0), `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in `l` with at least 1 character, `s` is 1, and `j` is a string that is in uppercase letters.
