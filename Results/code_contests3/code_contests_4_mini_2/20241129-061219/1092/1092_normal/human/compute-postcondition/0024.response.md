The value of `s` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 1, `l` is a list of strings containing at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in `l`, `s` is 2, and `j` is the next character in string `i`.
