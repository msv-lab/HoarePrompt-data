`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string, splits it into a list based on whitespace, and assigns that list to `l`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still within the range of 1 to 200. The previous input string is not stored or processed, but it has been split into a list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings resulting from the split of the input string.**
