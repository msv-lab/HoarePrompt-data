Correctness: **False**

The given program is intended to calculate the "volume of the text", which is defined as the maximum number of capital letters in any single word of the input text. However, it does not correctly handle the input constraints and can produce incorrect results based on the examples provided in the problem description.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for Words Without Capital Letters**: 
   - For the input `7` followed by `NonZERO`, the program will output `5`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because the word "NonZERO" contains `2` capital letters (N and Z).

2. **Handling of Whitespace**:
   - If there are multiple spaces between words or trailing spaces, the `split()` method should still capture the words correctly. However, the program does not account for potential cases of leading or trailing spaces, which can lead to incorrect counts if the input format is not strictly adhered to.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the input consists of words with mixed casing or no capital letters at all, the program should properly handle these cases. For instance, the input `3` followed by `abc` should return `0`, but the program logic might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements set out in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
