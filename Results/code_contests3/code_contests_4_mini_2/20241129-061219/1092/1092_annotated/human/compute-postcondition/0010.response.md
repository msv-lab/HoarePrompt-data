The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, the possible new values for `s` are 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list, `s` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list, `s` is either 1 or 2**
