Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` has at least one more element, `i` is the next string in the list `l`, if `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is updated to 1 and `i` is now assigned the next string from `l`. There is no change to `s` or `i` if `j` is not uppercase.***
