The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. This means that the previous count of uppercase characters in the string `i`, which was stored in `s`, is reset to `0`. Other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in the list, `s` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in the list, `s` is 0.**
