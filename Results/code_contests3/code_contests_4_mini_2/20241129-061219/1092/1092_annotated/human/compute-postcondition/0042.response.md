Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0, `l` has at least one more element, `i` is the next string in the list `l`, `j` is the next character in `i`, and if `j` is an uppercase letter, `s` is increased by 1. If `j` is uppercase, `s` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
