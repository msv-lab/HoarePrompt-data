`l` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which means `l` will be a list of strings created by splitting the input string. Since no variable captures the input from `raw_input()`, the previous value of `l` is not defined, and this assignment will create a new list. The initial state of `n` is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of strings from the input provided by `raw_input()`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive); `l` is a list of strings from the input provided by `raw_input()`.**
