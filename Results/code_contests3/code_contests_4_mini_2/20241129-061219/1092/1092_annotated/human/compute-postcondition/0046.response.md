Since the code simply prints the value of `m`, the output state will reflect the presence of `m` as it is, without changing any other variables. The value of `m` is known to be the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any string of `l`, but the exact value is not specified. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `m` is being printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is the maximum count of uppercase letters found in any string of `l`, `l` is a list of strings; `m` is printed.**
