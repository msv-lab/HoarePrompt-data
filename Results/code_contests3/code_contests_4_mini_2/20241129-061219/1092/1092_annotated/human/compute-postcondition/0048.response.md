The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it reads input from the user. It expects the first line of input to be an integer `n` (between 1 and 200 inclusive), which indicates the length of the following text input. The second line of input is a string of single-space separated words made up of Latin letters. The function then processes this input to count the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any word from the input string. After iterating through all the words, it prints the maximum count of uppercase letters.

It is important to note that the function does not have a return statement; instead, it directly prints the result. The function also does not validate the input length against the value of `n`, which means if the input string has fewer than `n` characters, it does not handle this potential edge case. 

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a string of single-space separated words from input, counts the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word, and prints this maximum count. It does not validate the length of the input string against `n` and does not return a value. **
