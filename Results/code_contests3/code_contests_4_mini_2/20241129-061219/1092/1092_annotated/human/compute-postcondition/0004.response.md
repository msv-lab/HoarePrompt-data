The variable `s` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `l`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State reflects the current values of all variables, including the newly assigned value of `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list, `s` is 0**
