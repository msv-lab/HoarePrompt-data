`The value of s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list, `s` is 1, `j` is the first character of `i`, and `j` is an uppercase character.**
