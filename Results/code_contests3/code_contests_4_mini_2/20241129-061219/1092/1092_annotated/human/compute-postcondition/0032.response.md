The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. Since there are no other operations affecting the other variables, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 200; `m` is either equal to `s` or remains 0; for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least one more element; `i` will be the next string in the list `l`; `s` is 0.
