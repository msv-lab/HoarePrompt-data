Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list, and `s` is either 0 or 1. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then the condition for the loop to execute one more time is satisfied, as `i` must have at least 2 characters and `j` is the second character in `i`. If `j` is not uppercase, the state remains unchanged.***
