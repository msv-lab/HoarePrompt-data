Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list `l` containing at least 2 characters, and `j` is the second character in the string `i`. If `j` is uppercase, then `s` is set to 3; otherwise, `s` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.***
