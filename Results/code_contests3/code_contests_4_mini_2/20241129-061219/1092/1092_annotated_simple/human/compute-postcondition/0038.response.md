The value of `s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` is 0, so after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and its previous value, `l` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `i` is the third string in the list `l`, `s` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next character in the string `i`.
