The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `s` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list `l`, `s` is 1, and `j` is a string that is in uppercase.**
