Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in the list `l`, `i` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `j` is the third character in `i`. If `j` is an uppercase letter, then `s` is increased by 1.***
