The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input which is expected to be a space-separated string of words. It counts the maximum number of uppercase letters found in any of these words and prints that maximum count. The code operates under the assumption that the input meets the specified constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), but it does not explicitly handle cases where the input does not conform to these constraints, such as empty input or input with no uppercase letters. If there are no uppercase letters in any of the words, the output will be `0`, which is not mentioned in the annotations. 

Functionality: ** The function reads a line of space-separated words from input, counts the maximum number of uppercase letters in any word, and prints this maximum count. If no uppercase letters are found, it will print `0`. The function does not handle cases where the input is empty or invalid. **
