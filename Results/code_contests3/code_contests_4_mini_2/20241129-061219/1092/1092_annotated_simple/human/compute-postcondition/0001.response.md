The variable `l` is assigned the value of the input received from `raw_input()`, which is then split into a list of strings. Since the initial state does not specify the exact content of the input text, we can only say that `l` will be a list of strings derived from the input. The variable `n` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `l` is a list of strings from the input.**
