Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and its previous value, `l` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `i` is the third string in the list `l`, if `j` is an uppercase character, then `s` is updated to 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next character in the string `i`.***
