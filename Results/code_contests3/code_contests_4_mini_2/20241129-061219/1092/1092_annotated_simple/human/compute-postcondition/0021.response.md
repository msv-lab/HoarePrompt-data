The value of `s` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `s` is not provided in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings, `i` is the second string in the list `l`, `i` is a non-empty string, `j` is an uppercase string, and `s` is increased by 1.
