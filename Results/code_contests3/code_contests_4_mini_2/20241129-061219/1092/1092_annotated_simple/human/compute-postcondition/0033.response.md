According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The variable `i` is the third string in the list `l`, and thus it needs to be verified that `i` is not an empty string. If `i` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and we need to ensure it contains at least one character for the loop to run at least once. 

Furthermore, the variable `j` represents the current character in the string `i` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, we can set the state of `j` to the first character of `i` to indicate the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and its previous value, `l` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `i` is the third string in the list `l`, `s` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `i` is a non-empty string and `j` is the first character of `i`**
