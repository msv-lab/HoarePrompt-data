According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `l`. If `l` contains more than one string, the loop will execute a second time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first string in the list `l`, and since `l` has at least 1 string, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 2 strings. In this case, `i` will be updated to the second string in the list `l`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200; `m` is the maximum of `s` and 0; `l` is a list of strings with at least 2 strings; `i` is the second string in the list `l`; `s` is the total number of uppercase characters in the string `i`.**
