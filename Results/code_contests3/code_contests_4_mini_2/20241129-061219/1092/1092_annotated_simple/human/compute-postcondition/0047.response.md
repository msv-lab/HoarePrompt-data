The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The input consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200, and a text string made up of single-space separated words containing only small and capital Latin letters. Based on the output conditions, the function processes this input to return a specific result. 

Since the specific output based on the input conditions has not been provided, I can only describe the functionality in general terms. However, it can be inferred that the function likely performs some operation based on the integer and the text. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process an integer `n` (within the specified range) and a string of words (composed of Latin letters) to produce a resulting output based on those inputs. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and processes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) along with a text string of space-separated words containing Latin letters to produce a specific output.**
