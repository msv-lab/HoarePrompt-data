Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is updated to be the maximum of `s` and its previous value, `l` is a list of strings with at least 3 strings, `i` is the third string in the list `l`, and `s` is 0. If `j` (the first character of `i`) is an uppercase letter, then `s` is updated to be 1.***
