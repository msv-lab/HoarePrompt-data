Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200, `m` is 0, `l` is a list of strings with at least 1 string, `i` is the first string in the list `l` and contains at least 2 characters. If `j` is an uppercase string, then `s` is set to 2. There is no change to `s` if `j` is not uppercase.***
