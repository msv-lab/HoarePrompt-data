Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description for the following reason:

1. The function `func()` does not take any parameters, and it uses `raw_input()` to read input. The problem description specifies that the first line of input is an integer which represents the length of the text, followed by the actual text itself. However, the first `raw_input()` call is ignored because it does not store or use the integer `n` in any way.

2. The program only checks for the maximum volume (number of capital letters) of the words in the text but does not account for the length of the text as specified in the input. The first line should also verify that the length of the second line of input matches the integer `n`, but this is not implemented in the program.

3. The program correctly counts the number of uppercase letters in each word and finds the maximum count, but it does not handle the input size constraint properly, as it does not ensure that the length of the text matches the given integer `n`.

Due to these issues, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description correctly.
