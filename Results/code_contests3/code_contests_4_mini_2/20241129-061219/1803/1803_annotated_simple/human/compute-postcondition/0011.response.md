The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is not specified, but it will now be `k + 3`. The states of `Arreglo` and `Cadena` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters, `k` is updated to `k + 3`.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters, `k` is updated to `k + 3**
