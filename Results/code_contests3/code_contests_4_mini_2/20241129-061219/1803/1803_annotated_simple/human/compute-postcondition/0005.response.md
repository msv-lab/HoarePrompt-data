The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `k` is 1, after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables, `Arreglo` and `Cadena`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters, and `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters, `k` is 4**
