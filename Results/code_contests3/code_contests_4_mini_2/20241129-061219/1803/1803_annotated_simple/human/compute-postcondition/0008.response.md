The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since the previous value of `k` is unknown, we cannot specify the exact new value of `k`. However, the states of `Arreglo` and `Cadena` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters; `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters; `k` is increased by 3.**
