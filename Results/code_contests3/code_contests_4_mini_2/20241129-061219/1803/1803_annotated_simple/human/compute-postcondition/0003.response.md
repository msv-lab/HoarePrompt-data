According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the lengths of the string `Cadena`. The loop condition requires that both `len(Cadena) > k` and `len(Cadena) > 2` must be true for the loop to execute. Currently, `k` is set to 1.

Right before the loop, `Cadena` is an input string. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 1 (which it is since `k` is 1) and also greater than 2.

Thus, the current state of `Cadena` must have more than 2 characters for the loop to execute. If `Cadena` contains at least 3 characters, both conditions will be satisfied.

State: **`Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `Cadena` must have more than 2 characters**
