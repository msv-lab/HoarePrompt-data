Functionality: ** The function reads a string input formatted as a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, extracts letters at every third index starting from index 1, and prints the number of unique letters from this subset. The function does not handle cases where the input does not conform to the expected format, nor does it return any values; it only prints the result. **
