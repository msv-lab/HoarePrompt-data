According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Cadena` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as the length of `Cadena` is greater than both `k` and 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has been increased by 3, which means its value is now greater than it was previously. Given that `Cadena` has more than 2 characters, for the loop to execute again, the length of `Cadena` must be greater than the new value of `k`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than the new value of `k`, which is `k - 3`. 

State: **`Arreglo` contains one element from `Cadena`, `Cadena` has more than 2 characters, and for the loop to execute again, the length of `Cadena` must be greater than k - 3**
