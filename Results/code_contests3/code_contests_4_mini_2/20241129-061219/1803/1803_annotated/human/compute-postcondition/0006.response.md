According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `Cadena` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as the length of `Cadena` is greater than `k` and greater than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 4. For the loop to execute again, the length of `Cadena` needs to be greater than 4 and also greater than 2. 

Since we do not know the actual length of `Cadena`, we can only determine that it must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue. 

State: **`Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, `k` is 4 and for the loop to execute again, the length of `Cadena` must be greater than 4**
