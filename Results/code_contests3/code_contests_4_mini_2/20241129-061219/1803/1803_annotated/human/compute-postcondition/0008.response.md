The value of `k` is incremented by 3, so the new value of `k` becomes 7. The list `Arreglo` remains unchanged since the code does not modify it. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, `k` is 4, and `k` is now updated to 7.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, `k` is now 7**
