The value of `k` is incremented by 3. Since `k` is initially 1, the new value of `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, `k` is 4.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
