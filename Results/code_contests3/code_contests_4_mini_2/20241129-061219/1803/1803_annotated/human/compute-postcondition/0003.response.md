According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `Cadena`. The conditions for the loop to execute are that the length of `Cadena` must be greater than `k` and also greater than 2. 

Right before the loop, we have:
- `k` is 1
- `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 1 (which is `k`) and also greater than 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 2. Since `Cadena` is currently a string input, we need to ensure that it contains at least three letters.

State: **`Arreglo` is an empty list, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time then `Cadena` must be a string containing at least three letters**
