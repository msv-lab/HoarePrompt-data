According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `len(Cadena)` and `k`. For the loop to execute again, `len(Cadena)` must be greater than `k` (which is 7) and also greater than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 7. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(Cadena)` needs to be greater than 7. 

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, for the loop to execute again `len(Cadena)` must be greater than 7**
