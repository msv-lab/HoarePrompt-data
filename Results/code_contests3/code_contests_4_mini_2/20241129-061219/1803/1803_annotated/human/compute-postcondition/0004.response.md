The code appends the element `Cadena[k]` to the list `Arreglo`. Since `Cadena` is a string containing at least three letters and `k` is 1, `Cadena[k]` refers to the second character of the string `Cadena`. The list `Arreglo`, which is initially empty, will now contain this character.

Therefore, the Output State is: `Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, and `k` is 1.

Output State: **`Arreglo` is now a list containing the second character of the string `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
