The function accepts a string formatted as a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with letters separated by a comma and a space. It extracts every third character starting from the second character (index 1) of the input string and constructs a list of these characters. The function then computes and prints the number of unique characters found in this list. However, if the input string is formatted incorrectly (not starting with '{' or not containing enough characters), it may not process as intended. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input may be empty or not conforming to the expected format.
