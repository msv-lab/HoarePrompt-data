You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Recently, Anton has found a set. The set consists of small English letters. Anton carefully wrote out all the letters from the set in one line, separated by a comma. He also added an opening curved bracket at the beginning of the line and a closing curved bracket at the end of the line. 

Unfortunately, from time to time Anton would forget writing some letter and write it again. He asks you to count the total number of distinct letters in his set.

Input

The first and the single line contains the set of letters. The length of the line doesn't exceed 1000. It is guaranteed that the line starts from an opening curved bracket and ends with a closing curved bracket. Between them, small English letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a space.

Output

Print a single number â€” the number of distinct letters in Anton's set.

Examples

Input

{a, b, c}


Output

3


Input

{b, a, b, a}


Output

2


Input

{}


Output

0
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string representing a set of small English letters formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", where each letter is separated by a comma followed by a space, and the string starts with an opening curly bracket and ends with a closing curly bracket. The length of the input string does not exceed 1000 characters.
def func():
    Cadena = raw_input()
    Arreglo = []
    k = 1
    while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
        Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
        
        k = k + 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `Arreglo` contains the characters from `Cadena` at indices 1, 4, 7, ..., up to the length of `Cadena`, `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `Cadena` or `k` is equal to the length of `Cadena` plus 1.
    print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string formatted as a set of small English letters enclosed in curly brackets, with letters separated by a comma and a space. It extracts every third character starting from the second character (index 1) of the input string and constructs a list of these characters. The function then computes and prints the number of unique characters found in this list. However, if the input string is formatted incorrectly (not starting with '{' or not containing enough characters), it may not process as intended. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input may be empty or not conforming to the expected format.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
