Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement for several reasons:

1. **Character Extraction Logic**: The program is designed to only extract characters from the input string at specific indices (1, 4, 7, ...). This means it is only capturing letters that are in positions corresponding to every third character starting from the second character. This logic fails to account for all letters in the set, especially if the number of letters is not a multiple of three or if there are letters that do not appear at those specific indices.

2. **Handling of the Input Format**: The function does not properly handle the input format. Although it checks that the string starts with '{' and ends with '}', it does not validate that the expected format (letters separated by ", ") is being followed. For example, if the input is malformed (like missing a space after a comma), the function could behave unexpectedly.

3. **Empty Set Handling**: While the program is supposed to handle the case of an empty set (i.e., "{}"), it does not adequately check for this scenario before attempting to extract characters. The program may produce an error or an incorrect count when given such input.

4. **Unintended Behavior with Duplicates**: The logic of extracting characters at specific indices does not account for duplicate letters that may appear in the input set. The problem states that Anton wants the count of distinct letters, but the current implementation may miss some letters entirely, leading to incorrect results.

In summary, the method of extracting characters is flawed and does not align with the requirement to count all distinct letters in the set as described in the problem statement. Hence, the program does not fulfill its intended purpose correctly.
