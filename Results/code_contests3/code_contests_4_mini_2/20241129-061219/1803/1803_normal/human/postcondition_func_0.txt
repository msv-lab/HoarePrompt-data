The function accepts a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" where each letter is separated by ", " and extracts characters from the input string at every third position starting from index 1 (i.e., indices 1, 4, 7, ...). It then counts the number of unique characters in this extracted subset and prints that count. If the input string does not conform to the expected format or is too short, the function may not behave as intended since it relies on specific indexing, potentially leading to an empty output or an inaccurate count.
