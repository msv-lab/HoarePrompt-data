The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is not provided, but it will be increased by 3 regardless of its initial value. The values of `Cadena` and `Arreglo` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and also includes `Cadena[k]`, and `k` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and also includes `Cadena[k]`, and `k` is increased by 3.**
