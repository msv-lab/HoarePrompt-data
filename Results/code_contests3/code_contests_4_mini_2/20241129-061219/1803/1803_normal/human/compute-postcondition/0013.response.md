The code calculates the number of unique characters in `Arreglo` by first converting it into a set (which removes duplicates) and then obtaining its length. Since `Arreglo` is derived from the characters at indices 1, 4, 7, ... of `Cadena`, its contents depend on the specific characters in `Cadena`. The variable `k` is not directly affected in this operation. 

Therefore, the output state depends on the unique characters found in `Arreglo`. We cannot determine the exact count without knowing the specific characters in `Cadena`, but we can state that the output reflects the unique character count.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters; `Arreglo` contains characters at indices 1, 4, 7, ... of `Cadena`; the number of unique characters in `Arreglo` is determined by `len(set(Arreglo))`.**
