The code appends the character `Cadena[k]` to the list `Arreglo`. The value of `k` must be less than `len(Cadena)` for the loop to execute again, indicating that `k` is a valid index for `Cadena`. The previous value of `Arreglo` is not specified, but it starts with the second character of `Cadena`. After executing the code, `Arreglo` will contain its previous elements plus the new character from `Cadena` at index `k`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and now also includes `Cadena[k]`, assuming `k` is a valid index.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters; `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena` and now also includes `Cadena[k]`.**
