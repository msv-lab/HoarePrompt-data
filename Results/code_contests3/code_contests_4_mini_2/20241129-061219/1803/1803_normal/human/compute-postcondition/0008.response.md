The value of `k` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `k` is unknown, but it will now be `k + 3`. The other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, and `k` is now `k + 3`.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, and `k` is now `k + 3**
