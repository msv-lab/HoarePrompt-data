`k` is assigned the value of `k + 3`. The previous value of `k` is 1, so after execution, `k` becomes 4. The states of the other variables, `Cadena` and `Arreglo`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, `k` is 4.
Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, `k` is 4**
