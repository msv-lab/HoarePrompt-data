`Arreglo` is assigned the value of `Arreglo` concatenated with a new list containing the element `Cadena[k]`. The value of `k` is 1, so `Cadena[k]` refers to the second character of `Cadena`. Since `Arreglo` is initially an empty list, after execution, `Arreglo` will contain the second character of `Cadena`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, and `k` is 1.

Output State: **`Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the second character of `Cadena`, `k` is 1**
