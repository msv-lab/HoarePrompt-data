#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a string representing a set of small English letters formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}", where each letter is separated by ", " and the string starts with an opening curly brace and ends with a closing curly brace. The length of the string does not exceed 1000 characters.
def func():
    Cadena = raw_input()
    Arreglo = []
    k = 1
    while len(Cadena) > k and len(Cadena) > 2:
        Arreglo = Arreglo + [Cadena[k]]
        
        k = k + 3
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `Cadena` is a string input with more than two characters, `Arreglo` contains the characters at indices 1, 4, 7, ... of `Cadena`, and `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `Cadena`
    print(len(list(set(Arreglo))))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string formatted as "{letter1, letter2, ...}" where each letter is separated by ", " and extracts characters from the input string at every third position starting from index 1 (i.e., indices 1, 4, 7, ...). It then counts the number of unique characters in this extracted subset and prints that count. If the input string does not conform to the expected format or is too short, the function may not behave as intended since it relies on specific indexing, potentially leading to an empty output or an inaccurate count.
