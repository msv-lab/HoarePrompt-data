The function `func` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, while `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100. The function does not return any specific value or output based on the provided details. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two large positive integers, `n` and `m`, as well as two smaller integers, `a` and `b`, but no return value has been specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m as positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and a and b as integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), but does not return any specific output.**
