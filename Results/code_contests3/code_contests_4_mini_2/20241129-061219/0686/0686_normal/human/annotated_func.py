#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and has no implementation or return statement defined. Thus, it does not perform any operations or return any values, despite the annotations suggesting it operates with certain constraints on the integers n, m, a, and b.
