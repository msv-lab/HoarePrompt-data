Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to determine the minimal cost to make the number of commentary boxes divisible by the number of delegations. However, the provided code is empty (represented by `{}`), which means there is no implementation to address the problem. 

To illustrate a case where the program would fail, consider the following input:
```
n = 5
m = 3
a = 2
b = 3
```
In this case, the output should be computed as follows:
- The nearest multiples of `m` to `n` are 3 and 6.
- To reach 3, we would demolish 2 boxes, costing `2 * b = 2 * 3 = 6` burles.
- To reach 6, we would build 1 box, costing `1 * a = 1 * 2 = 2` burles.

The minimal cost to satisfy the condition would be 2 burles (by building 1 box).

Since the program does not perform any calculations or logic, it cannot provide the correct answer for any input, which leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
