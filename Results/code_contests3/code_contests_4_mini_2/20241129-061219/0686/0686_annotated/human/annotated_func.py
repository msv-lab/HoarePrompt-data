#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100.
def func():
    {}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` is defined without any input parameters and contains no executable code. Therefore, it does not perform any operations or return any values, despite the annotations suggesting it should accept positive integers `n` and `m`, and integers `a` and `b`. The actual functionality is that the function is effectively a placeholder that does nothing.
