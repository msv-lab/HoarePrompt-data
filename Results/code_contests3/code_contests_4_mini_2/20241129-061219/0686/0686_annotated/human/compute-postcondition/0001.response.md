The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without parameters in the signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^12, and `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to 100. 

Since the output behavior of the function is unspecified in the prompt, we cannot define specific cases or return values. Therefore, we can only outline the constraints on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^12) and integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100), but does not have defined input parameters in its signature.**
