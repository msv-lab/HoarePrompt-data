To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The program reads five integers representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game. It calculates the total sum of these coins (`s`) and checks two conditions:

1. If the total sum `s` is zero, it prints `-1`. This is correct because if all players have zero coins, then it's impossible for them to have made any positive initial bets.
2. If `s` is not zero, it checks if `s` is divisible by the number of players (which is always 5 here). If not divisible, it prints `-1`, indicating that a uniform initial bet cannot result in the given distribution of coins.

If both conditions are satisfied, it computes `s / len(c)` (where `len(c)` is 5) to determine the initial bet `b`.

Let's examine potential edge cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: All players have zero coins:
   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: One player has coins, and the rest have zero:
   - Input: `10 0 0 0 0`
   - Expected Output: `-1` (since there is no positive uniform bet)
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: Players have coins resulting in a non-integer bet:
   - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
   - Total coins = 15. Since `15 % 5 == 0`, the output should be `3` (initial bet).
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4**: Players have coins such that the total is not divisible by 5:
   - Input: `1 1 1 1 2`
   - Total coins = 6. Since `6 % 5 != 0`, the output should be `-1`.
   - Actual Output: `-1` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5**: All players have the same number of coins:
   - Input: `3 3 3 3 3`
   - Total coins = 15. Since `15 % 5 == 0`, the output should be `3`.
   - Actual Output: `3` (Correct)

After analyzing these edge cases and confirming that the program behaves correctly for them, we can conclude that the logic is correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
