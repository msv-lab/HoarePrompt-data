The function `func` does not take any parameters. It is implied that the function operates on five integer variables representing the number of coins each player has at the end of the game, denoted as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. Each of these integers is within the range of 0 to 100. Since the output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we cannot specify the return value or cases. Therefore, based on the information given:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates on five integers representing the number of coins each player has, where each integer is in the range 0 to 100.**
