To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state. 

The code is:
```
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

1. The variable `s` is checked. If `s` is 0, the output will be -1.
2. If `s` is not 0, we check if `s % len(c) != 0`. If this condition is true, the output will also be -1.
3. If `s` is not 0 and `s % len(c) == 0`, the output will be the result of `s / len(c)`.

Since we need to know `len(c)`, we assume `c` is a list containing the integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, which means `len(c)` is 5.

Therefore, the evaluation depends on the specific value of `s`. 

Given the variables:
- `s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`.

Now we can summarize the cases:
- If `s` is 0, return -1.
- If `s` is not 0, and `s` is not divisible by 5, return -1.
- If `s` is not 0 and is divisible by 5, return `s / 5`.

Since we don't have specific values for `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, we can only express the output state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`s` is the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`; return -1 if `s` is 0 or `s` is not divisible by 5; else return `s / 5`.**
