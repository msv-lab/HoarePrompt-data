The function accepts input representing the number of coins each of the five players has, calculates the total number of coins, and returns the average number of coins per player if the total is non-zero and divisible by five. If the total is zero or not divisible by five, it returns -1. Note that the function does not directly accept parameters; it reads from standard input.
