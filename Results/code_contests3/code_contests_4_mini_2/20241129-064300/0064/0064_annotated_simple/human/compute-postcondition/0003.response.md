The function `func` does not take any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. Instead, it relies on five integer variables representing the number of coins each player has. These variables are `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, and they are constrained such that each is an integer within the range of 0 to 100.

The function returns outputs based on the values of these five variables. However, the exact output behavior based on these variables is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact outputs or conditions that lead to different outputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of coins each of the five players has, represented by integers c1, c2, c3, c4, and c5, constrained between 0 and 100. The specific return values based on these inputs are not detailed.**
