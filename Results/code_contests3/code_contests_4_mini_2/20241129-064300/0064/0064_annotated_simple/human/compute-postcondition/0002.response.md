To determine the output state, we first need to establish the sum of the list `c`, which is represented by `s`. The code checks if `s` is equal to 0 or if `s` is not divisible by the length of `c`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `s / len(c)`.

1. Calculate `s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`.
2. Determine the length of `c`, which is 5 since there are five players.
3. Check the conditions:
   - If `s == 0`, print `-1`.
   - If `s % 5 != 0`, print `-1`.
   - If neither condition is true, print `s / 5`.

Since we don't have specific values for `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, the output will depend on the computed sum `s`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that the output depends on the computed value of `s` and the conditions evaluated. 

Output State: **The output depends on the sum `s` of the integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5`: print -1 if `s` is 0 or not divisible by 5, otherwise print `s / 5`.**
