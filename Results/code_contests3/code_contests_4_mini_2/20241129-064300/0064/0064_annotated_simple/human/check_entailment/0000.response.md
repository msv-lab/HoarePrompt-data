Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why it fails:

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()` which is appropriate for Python 2 but not for Python 3. In Python 3, it should use `input()`. This inconsistency affects the functionality of the program.

2. **Calculation of Initial Bet**: 
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the coins and checks if `s` is zero or if `s` is not divisible by the number of players (which is hardcoded as `len(c)`). However, the problem states that each player must have made a non-zero initial bet `b`, and that `b` should be a positive integer.
   - The logic `s % len(c) != 0` checks if the total coins are evenly distributed among the players, but it does not guarantee that each player has at least 1 coin from their initial bet. The correct logic should check if each player has at least `b` coins after the game has concluded.

3. **Output Logic**: The program outputs `-1` only when `s` is zero or when the total number of coins is not evenly divisible by 5. However, it does not check if all players have non-negative coins and if the derived initial bet `b` is non-zero.

4. **Final Calculation**: The division `s / len(c)` gives the average number of coins per player, which does not represent the initial bet correctly. The program must ensure that `b` is the same for all players after accounting for any transfers, and it must also ensure that all players have at least `b` coins left.

Overall, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description, particularly the need to ensure that each player had a non-zero initial bet and the output must be a positive integer that satisfies the game conditions.
