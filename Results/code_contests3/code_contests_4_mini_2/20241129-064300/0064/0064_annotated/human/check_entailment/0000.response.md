Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `map(int, raw_input().split())`, which is not appropriate in Python 3. The correct function should be `input()` instead of `raw_input()`.

2. **Logic for Initial Bet Calculation**: The program calculates the average by summing the values of `c` and checking if the sum is divisible by the length of `c`. However, the problem requires determining the initial bet `b`, which should be a positive integer. The program incorrectly returns the average number of coins per player, which may not correspond to a valid initial bet scenario. The average calculation does not ensure that each player had at least one coin initially, nor does it guarantee that the outcome of the game is valid.

3. **Handling of Zero Total Coins**: The program correctly identifies when the total is zero but does not adequately handle the case where the outcome is not possible. The problem states that if there is any non-positive initial bet `b`, the output should be `-1`. The program checks for zero but does not consider scenarios where the total number of coins does not allow for a valid positive bet.

In summary, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not accurately reflect the logic needed to determine the initial bet `b` based on the final state of the players. Instead, it incorrectly calculates the average of the coins and does not validate the necessary conditions for a valid outcome.
