The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates with five integers representing the number of coins that each of the five players has at the end of the game, denoted as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. Each of these integers must satisfy the constraint that they are within the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). The function processes these coin values and produces an output based on certain conditions related to the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`. 

However, since the specific output conditions are not provided in the prompt, we cannot detail them further. Therefore, the functionality of the function is based solely on the acceptance of these parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts five integers representing the number of coins for each of the five players, where each integer is between 0 and 100 (inclusive).**
