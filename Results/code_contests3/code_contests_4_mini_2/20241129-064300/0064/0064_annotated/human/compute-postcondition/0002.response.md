To determine the output state based on the given initial state and code snippet, we first need to define the variables involved.

Initial State: `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `c5` are integers representing the number of coins each of the five players has. Letâ€™s calculate `s` as the sum of these coins: 

```
s = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5
```

Now, we will apply the logic in the provided code snippet:

```
print - 1 if s == 0 or s % len(c) != 0 else s / len(c)
```

Here, `len(c)` refers to the number of players, which is 5. 

1. **Check if `s == 0`:** If the sum `s` is zero, we would print `-1`.
2. **Check if `s % len(c) != 0`:** If `s` is not zero, we also need to check if `s` is divisible by 5. If it is not divisible, we would again print `-1`.
3. If both conditions fail (i.e., `s` is greater than 0 and divisible by 5), we calculate `s / len(c)` which is `s / 5`.

Now, we summarize the output state based on these conditions. Since we do not have specific values for `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `c5`, we cannot directly compute `s`. Instead, we can express the output state based on the possible outcomes of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is `c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 + c5`; if `s` is 0, print -1; if `s` is not divisible by 5, print -1; else print `s / 5`.**
