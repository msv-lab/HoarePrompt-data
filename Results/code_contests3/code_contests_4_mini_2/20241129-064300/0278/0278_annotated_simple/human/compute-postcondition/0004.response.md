Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` (between 1 and 20) and `V` (between 1 and 10000), along with two lists `a` and `b`, where the elements of `a` are integers (between 1 and 100) and the elements of `b` are floats (between 0 and 100). It calculates a minimum value based on a specified formula involving these parameters and prints this result. However, the function does not handle cases where `b` might contain zero, which could lead to division by zero if such a case arises, potentially causing an error in execution. **
