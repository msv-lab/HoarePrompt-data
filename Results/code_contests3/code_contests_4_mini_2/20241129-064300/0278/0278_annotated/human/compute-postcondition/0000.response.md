The code assigns values to `n` and `V` by taking user input and then mapping those inputs to integers. The previous values of `n` and `V` were not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values after this operation. However, it is clear that `n` will remain within the range of 1 to 20 and `V` will remain within the range of 1 to 10000 based on the conditions provided. Therefore, we denote that `n` and `V` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000**
