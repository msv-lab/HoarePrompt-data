The code assigns two lists `a` and `b` with floating-point numbers. The first list `a` is populated by taking input from the user, splitting the input string by spaces, and converting each split string into a float. The second list `b` is populated in the same manner with another input. The values of `n` and `V` are not affected by this operation, but `a` and `b` will contain floating-point representations of the numbers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20, `V` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `V` ≤ 10000; `a` is a list of floats from the first input; `b` is a list of floats from the second input.**
