The function reads two integers `n` and `V`, followed by two lists of floats `a` and `b`. It calculates a value based on the minimum ratio of elements from `b` to `a`, scaled by each element in `a`, and then returns the minimum of this computed value and `V`. It does not return any value explicitly, but prints the result. The function operates under the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 20`, `1 ≤ V ≤ 10000`, and `1 ≤ ai ≤ 100`, `0 ≤ bi ≤ 100`. The potential edge cases arise from the behavior of the lambda functions and the division operation if any element in `a` is zero.
