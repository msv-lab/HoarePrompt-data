Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The function uses `raw_input()`, which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead. This would cause the program to fail if executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Calculation Logic**: The use of `reduce` and lambda functions is overly complex and not clear. The inner `reduce` attempts to find the minimum ratio of corresponding elements from `b` to `a`, but it does so in a convoluted way. This could lead to incorrect results due to the potential for division by zero if any `ai` is zero. However, according to the constraints provided (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100), this should not happen, but it still contributes to the lack of clarity.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result directly rather than returning it. While this may not affect correctness in a competitive programming context, it does not adhere to the common practice of returning values from functions.

4. **Volume Calculation**: The calculation `min(reduce(...), V)` aims to find the maximum possible volume of borscht that can be cooked. The correct approach would involve determining the maximum `x` such that the total ingredients do not exceed the available amounts and the total volume does not exceed `V`. The current implementation does not explicitly follow the described logic of calculating the maximum possible volume based on the proportions and available ingredients.

Overall, due to these identified issues, the program does not adequately fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. Thus, it is not correct.
