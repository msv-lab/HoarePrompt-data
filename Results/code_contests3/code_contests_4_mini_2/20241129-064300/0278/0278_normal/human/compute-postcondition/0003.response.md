The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `n`, which is an integer in the range 1 to 20.
- `V`, which is an integer in the range 1 to 10000.
- `ai`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 100.
- `bi`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 100.

The output behavior of the function is not specified explicitly, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function processes these inputs to produce a result. However, without specific output conditions described, we cannot detail the return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (integer 1 to 20), V (integer 1 to 10000), ai (list of n integers in range 1 to 100), and bi (list of n integers in range 0 to 100). The exact return value is not specified.**
