The expression `bin(j + 1)` converts `j + 1` to its binary representation. Given that `j` is 1, `j + 1` equals 2, which in binary is `0b10`. The string representation of this binary number is `'0b10'`. 

Next, `[::-1]` reverses this string, resulting in `'01b0'`. The `find('1')` method then searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string. The '1' in `'01b0'` is at index 1. Adding 1 to this index gives us 2.

The values of the other variables have not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 1, and the printed output is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 1, and the printed output is 2.**
