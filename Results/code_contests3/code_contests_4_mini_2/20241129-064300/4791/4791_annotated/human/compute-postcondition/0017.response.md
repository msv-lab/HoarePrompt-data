The value of `j` is 2, so we calculate `j + 1`, which gives us 3. Next, we convert 3 to its binary representation using `bin(3)`, which results in the string `'0b11'`. We then reverse this string, resulting in `'11b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 gives us a final value of 1.

The output state reflects that the output variable has been calculated, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 4, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 2, output is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 4, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 2, output is 1**
