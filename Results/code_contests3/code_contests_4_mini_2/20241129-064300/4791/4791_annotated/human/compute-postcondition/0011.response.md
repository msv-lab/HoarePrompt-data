`n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is `N - 1`, so after the operation, `n` becomes `N - 2`. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is `n - 1`, and the printed outputs are the positions of the least significant '1' bits for integers from `1` to `n`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is `n - 1`, and the printed outputs are the positions of the least significant '1' bits for integers from `1` to `n`.**
