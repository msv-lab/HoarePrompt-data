The expression `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` evaluates as follows:

1. `j + 1` is calculated, which results in `2 + 1 = 3`.
2. `bin(3)` converts the integer `3` into its binary representation, resulting in the string `'0b11'`.
3. The slice `[::-1]` reverses the string, so `'0b11'` becomes `'11b0'`.
4. The method `.find('1')` searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string `'11b0'`, which is found at index `0`.
5. Finally, `+ 1` is added to this index, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`.

The output of the print statement will be `1`, but since the variable `output` is not modified by the print statement, it remains `1`. Therefore, other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is at least 4, `n` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `output` is 1, and the expression evaluates to 1.**
