The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` calculates the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and adds 1 to that position. 

1. The value of `j` is 2.
2. Therefore, `j + 1` equals 3.
3. The binary representation of 3 is `11`.
4. Reversing `11` gives `11`.
5. The first occurrence of '1' in `11` is at index 0.
6. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1.

No other variables are affected, and since the output is from a print statement, we will include that in the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 2; the output of the print statement is 1.**
