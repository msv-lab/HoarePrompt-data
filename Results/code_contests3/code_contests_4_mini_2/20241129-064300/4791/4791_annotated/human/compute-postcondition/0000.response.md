`n` is assigned the value `input()`, which accepts an input that is a string representation of an integer. The previous state of `N` remains unchanged because `N` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.**
