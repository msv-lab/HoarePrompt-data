According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The variable `n` is defined as `N - 1`, which ensures that `n` will be at least 1 (since `N` is between 2 and 500). Therefore, the loop will execute at least once. 

Before the loop starts, `j` should be initialized to 0, as that is the starting point of the loop iteration. 

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1, `j` is 0**
