According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is a non-empty string. Right before the loop, `n` is an input string. To ensure that the loop executes for the first time, `n` must not be an empty string. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be a non-empty string.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be a non-empty string**
