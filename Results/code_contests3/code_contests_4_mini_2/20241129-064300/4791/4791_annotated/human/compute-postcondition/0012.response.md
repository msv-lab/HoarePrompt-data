According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for values of `j` starting from `0` up to `n - 1`. Since `n` is defined as `N - 2`, it is guaranteed to be at least `0` when `N` is `2` or greater. 

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be at least `1`, which means `N` must be at least `3`. Given the current state where `N` is between `2` and `500`, the following adjustments can be made for the loop to execute:

1. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `0`, which implies `N` must be at least `3`.
2. The initial value of `j` before the loop starts should be `0`.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to confirm that `N` is at least `3` and adjust `j` to `0`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 3 and 500, `n` is `N - 2`, `j` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` is at least 1**
