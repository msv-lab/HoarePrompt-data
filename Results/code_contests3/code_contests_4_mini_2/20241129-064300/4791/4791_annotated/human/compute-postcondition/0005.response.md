According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `n` is `N - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n = N - 1` and `N` is at least 2).

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
