`n` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is `N - 2`, so after execution, `n` becomes `N - 3`. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is `N - 3`, and we have decremented `n` by 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 3`, `j` is `N - 3` and `n` is decremented by 1.**
