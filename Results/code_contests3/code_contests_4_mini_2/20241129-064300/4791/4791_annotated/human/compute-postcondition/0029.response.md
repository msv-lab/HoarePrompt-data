The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It generates an output representing levels of passages connecting rooms, formatted as a sequence of positive integers. The output corresponds to a specific arrangement of these levels, constrained by the input value of `N`, which is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate and return a sequence of positive integers that represent levels of passages connecting rooms based on the internal logic associated with the value of `N`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a sequence of positive integers representing levels of passages connecting rooms based on the value of N (an integer between 2 and 500 inclusive).**
