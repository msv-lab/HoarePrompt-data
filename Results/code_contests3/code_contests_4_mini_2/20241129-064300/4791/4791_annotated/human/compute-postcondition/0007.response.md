According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is `N - 1`, where `N` is an integer between 2 and 500. This means `n` is at least 1 (since `N` is at least 2).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` becoming 2. For this next iteration to be valid, `n` must be greater than 2. Since `n` equals `N - 1`, it follows that `N` must be greater than 3.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `N` must be greater than 3**
