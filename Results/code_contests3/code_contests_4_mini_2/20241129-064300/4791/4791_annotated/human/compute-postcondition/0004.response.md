The code prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and adds 1 to that position. Given the initial state where `j` is 0, the expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `0b1`. Reversing this gives us `1`. The index of the first '1' in `1` is 0, and adding 1 results in 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 0 and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is `N - 1`, `j` is 0 and the output of the print statement is 1.**
