#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The output should represent levels of passages connecting rooms in a specific format where each level is a positive integer.
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is -1, and the output contains the positions of the least significant '1' bits for integers from 1 to `N - 1` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer input from the user, and prints the positions of the least significant '1' bits for integers from 1 to `n - 1` for each value of `n` until `n` becomes 0, but it does not validate that `n` is between 2 and 500, and it does not return any value.
