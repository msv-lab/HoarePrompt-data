#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is 0, and `j` has iterated from `N-1` to 0. The printed outputs are the first occurrences of '1' in the binary representations of integers from 1 to `N-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer `n` from input, and prints the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of integers from `1` to `n-1` for each positive integer input until `n` decrements to 0. However, it currently does not convert the input to an integer, which may cause execution issues if the input is not an integer.
