According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1. After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
