According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is not an empty string (i.e., `n` is truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a string representing an integer value of at least 1. Since a non-empty string is considered truthy in Python, the loop can execute again as long as `n` remains non-empty.

Given that `n` is already a string representing an integer value (at least 1), it is non-empty. Therefore, the loop will indeed execute one more time without needing any adjustments to the states.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string representing an integer value of at least 1, `j` is `n - 1`**
