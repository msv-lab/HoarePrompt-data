The variable `n` is a string representing an integer value of at least 1. When we execute `n -= 1`, it attempts to subtract 1 from the string value of `n`, which will result in an error since strings cannot be directly decremented. Therefore, the output state reflects that the operation cannot be performed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string representing an integer value of at least 1, `j` is `n - 1` and the operation `n -= 1` cannot be performed due to type incompatibility.**
