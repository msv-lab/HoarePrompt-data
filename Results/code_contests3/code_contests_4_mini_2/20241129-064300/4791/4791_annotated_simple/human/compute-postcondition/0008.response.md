In the provided code snippet, the expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` is evaluated:

1. **Calculate `j + 1`:** 
   - The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3.

2. **Convert to binary:** 
   - The binary representation of 3 is `'0b11'`.

3. **Reverse the string:** 
   - Reversing `'0b11'` gives `'11b0'`.

4. **Find the index of '1':**
   - The first occurrence of '1' in `'11b0'` is at index 0.

5. **Add 1 to the index:**
   - Adding 1 to the index 0 gives a result of 1.

The values of the other variables (`N` and `n`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is determined by the result of the `print` statement.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the operation is 1.**
