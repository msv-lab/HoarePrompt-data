The code prints the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to it. 

First, calculate `j + 1`:
- `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3.

Next, find the binary representation of 3:
- The binary representation of 3 is `11`.

Reverse the binary string:
- Reversing `11` gives `11`.

Now find the index of the first '1':
- The first '1' is at index 0 (the first character in the reversed string).

Finally, add 1 to the index:
- 0 + 1 = 1.

Since the code is only printing this result and does not affect any other variables, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and the output is 1. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `j` is 2, and the output is 1.**
