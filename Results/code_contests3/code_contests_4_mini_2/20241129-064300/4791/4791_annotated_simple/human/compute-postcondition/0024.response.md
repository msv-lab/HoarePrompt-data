The code calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses the string representation, and then finds the index of '1', adding 1 to this index to get a 1-based position. 

Given that `j` is 1, the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. `j + 1` will be `1 + 1`, which equals `2`.
2. The binary representation of `2` is `'10'`.
3. Reversing this string gives us `'01'`.
4. The `find('1')` method will return `1` because the first occurrence of '1' is at index `1` in the reversed string.
5. Adding `1` to this index gives `1 + 1 = 2`.

No other variables are affected in this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is `2`. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, and the printed result is 2.**
