The variable `n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input as a string. The value of `N`, which is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is now an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is now an input string.**
