The code snippet calculates the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reverses that binary string, and then finds the index of '1' (which represents the position of the first '1' from the right) and adds 1 to it. Given that `j` is initialized to 1, we can compute the value as follows:

1. Calculate `j + 1`: 
   - `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2.

2. Convert `2` to binary: 
   - The binary representation of `2` is `'10'`.

3. Reverse the binary string: 
   - Reversing `'10'` gives us `'01'`.

4. Find the position of the first '1': 
   - In the reversed string `'01'`, the first '1' is at index 1 (0-based index).

5. Add 1 to the index: 
   - Therefore, `1 + 1` equals `2`.

Since the other variables `N` and `n` are not affected by this operation, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of those variables along with the result of the computation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string representing an integer value of at least 1, `j` is 1, and the result of the print statement is 2.**
