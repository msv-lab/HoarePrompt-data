The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, it can be converted to an integer for the decrement operation. The updated value of `n` will be the integer value of `n` minus 1. The value of `j` was previously defined as `n - 1`, so it will now be updated to reflect the new value of `n`. 

Assuming `n` was converted to an integer, we can denote the new value of `n` as `int(n) - 1`. The value of `j` will then be `int(n) - 2` because it was originally `n - 1`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `n` and `j`, while `N` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is the string representing the integer value decremented by 1, `j` is now the integer value of `n` minus 2**.
