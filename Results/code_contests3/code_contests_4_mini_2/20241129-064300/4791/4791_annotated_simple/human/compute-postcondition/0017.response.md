The code calculates the binary representation of `j + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. The binary representation of 3 is `11`. The code then reverses this string, resulting in `11` (as reversing does not change it in this case). It then finds the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is at index 0. Finally, it adds 1 to this index, resulting in `0 + 1 = 1`. The print statement produces an output of 1, but the initial state of the print statement states the result is 2, which may indicate a discrepancy or a separate context.

However, since we are focused on the output of the print statement, the result is `1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is a string representing an integer value greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the result of the print statement is 1.**
