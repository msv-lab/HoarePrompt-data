The function accepts no parameters, reads an integer `n` from input, and prints the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of integers from `1` to `n-1` for each positive integer input until `n` decrements to 0. However, it currently does not convert the input to an integer, which may cause execution issues if the input is not an integer.
