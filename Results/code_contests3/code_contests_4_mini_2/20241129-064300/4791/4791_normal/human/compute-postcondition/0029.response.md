The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is specified that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Based on the output, the function likely calculates or processes some value based on `N` and returns a result. 

Since there is no direct output provided in the instruction for the return value based on `N`, we cannot specify cases or return outcomes. Therefore, we can only describe the input constraint without detailing the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is constrained to work with an integer N that is between 2 and 500 (inclusive). The specific return value or behavior based on N is not provided.**
