The expression `bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1` will be evaluated as follows:

1. Since `j` is equal to `n`, and the loop cannot execute again because `j` is not less than `n`, `j + 1` will be `n + 1`.
2. The binary representation of `n + 1` will be calculated using `bin(n + 1)`.
3. The binary string will then be reversed using `[::-1]`.
4. The method `.find('1')` will locate the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed binary string, which gives the index of the first '1'.
5. Finally, `1` is added to this index to get the final result.

The output will be the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `n + 1`, counting from 1.

Since `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 and `n` is greater than 0, the specific values of `N` and `n` do not need to be known for the output state, as the calculation will derive from these conditions.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n`; the output is the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `n + 1`, counting from 1.**
