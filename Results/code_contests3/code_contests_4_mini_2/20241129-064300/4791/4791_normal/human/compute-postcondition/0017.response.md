The value of `j` is 2. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. The binary representation of `3` is `0b11`. Reversing this string gives us `11`. The `find('1')` method locates the index of the first occurrence of '1', which is at index `0`. Adding `1` to this index results in `1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
