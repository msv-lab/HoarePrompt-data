According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop continues as long as `n` is not an empty string (i.e., `n` evaluates to True). Right before the loop, `n` is an input string. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be a non-empty string. Therefore, the state of `n` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is not empty.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be a non-empty string**
