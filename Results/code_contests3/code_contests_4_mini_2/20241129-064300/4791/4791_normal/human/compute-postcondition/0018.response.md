To analyze the given loop, we note that it iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The variable `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. The print statement outputs the position of the first '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, which effectively outputs the position of the least significant bit set to '1'.

Considering the output states provided after the first three iterations:
- After 1 iteration (`j = 0`), the output is `1` (binary of `1` is `1`).
- After 2 iterations (`j = 1`), the output is `2` (binary of `2` is `10`).
- After 3 iterations (`j = 2`), the output is `1` (binary of `3` is `11`).

Thus, for all iterations from `0` to `n-1`, the output will include the position of the least significant bit set to '1' for each integer from `1` to `n`.

After the loop completes all its iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`), we can determine the following:
- `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500.
- `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0.
- `j` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
- The output will be a series of integers that represent the positions of the least significant '1' bits for all integers from `1` to `n`.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has executed all iterations is:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is `n`, and the output consists of the positions of the least significant bits set to '1' for all integers from `1` to `n`.**
