`j` is currently 0. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `'0b1'`. When we take the string representation of the binary number and reverse it, we get `'1b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this index gives us 1. The other variables `N` and `n` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
