The expression `j + 1` evaluates to `2 + 1`, which is `3`. The `bin` function converts `3` to its binary representation, which is `'0b11'`. The string slice `bin(j + 1)[::-1]` reverses this string, resulting in `'11b0'`. The `find('1')` method searches for the first occurrence of `'1'` in the reversed string, which is found at index `0`. Adding `1` gives a final result of `1`.

The output of the `print` statement is therefore `1`, and the states of the other variables are unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string that evaluates to an integer greater than 2, `j` is 2, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
