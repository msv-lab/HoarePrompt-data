According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times, starting with `j` initialized to 0 and going up to `n - 1`. Since `n` is stated to be a positive integer greater than 0, the loop will execute successfully. 

Before the loop begins, `j` is currently set to `n - 1`, which needs to be adjusted to 0 for the loop to execute starting from the first iteration. Therefore, the necessary states need to reflect that `j` is initialized to 0, and `n` must remain a positive integer.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is now 0 for the loop to execute the first time**
