The value of `j` is 0. The expression `j + 1` evaluates to 1. The binary representation of 1 is `0b1`, and when reversed, it becomes `1b0`. The `find('1')` method locates the first occurrence of '1' in this reversed string, which is at index 0. Adding 1 to this result gives us 1. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string that evaluates to an integer greater than 0, `j` is 0, and the output of the print statement is 1.**
