According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2**
