`n` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a user input as a string. The previous value of `N` is not affected by this operation, and `N` remains an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive). Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive); `n` is an input string**
