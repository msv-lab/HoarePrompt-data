The value of `n` is decremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, the new value of `n` will be a positive integer that is still greater than or equal to 0. The values of `N` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (now decreased by 1), and `j` is `n`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 (now decreased by 1), `j` is `n`**
