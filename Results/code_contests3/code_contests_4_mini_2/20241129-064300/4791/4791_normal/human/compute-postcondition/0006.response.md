The code `print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)` calculates the position of the first occurrence of '1' in the binary representation of `j + 1`, reversed, and then adds 1 to that position. 

Given that `j` is initially 1, we can calculate:
- `j + 1` = 1 + 1 = 2
- `bin(2)` returns `'0b10'`.
- Reversing this string gives us `'01b0'`.
- The `find('1')` method will locate the first occurrence of '1' in the reversed string, which is at index 1.
- Adding 1 to this result gives us 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is 2. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is a non-empty string that evaluates to an integer greater than 1, `j` is 1, and the output of the print statement is 2.**
