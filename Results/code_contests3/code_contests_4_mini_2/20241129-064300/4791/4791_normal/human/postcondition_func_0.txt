The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `n`. It then decrements `n` until it reaches 0, during which it prints the position of the least significant bit set to '1' for each integer from `1` to the original value of `n`. However, since `n` is taken as input, there is no validation to ensure it is within the specified range of 2 to 500, and the function does not return any value. The function's behavior when `n` is not a valid integer is also not handled, leading to potential errors.
