#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = input()
    while n:
        n -= 1
        
        for j in range(n):
            print(bin(j + 1)[::-1].find('1') + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `n` is 0, `j` is not defined as the loop ends, and the output consists of the positions of the least significant bits set to '1' for all integers from `1` to the original value of `N`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `n`. It then decrements `n` until it reaches 0, during which it prints the position of the least significant bit set to '1' for each integer from `1` to the original value of `n`. However, since `n` is taken as input, there is no validation to ensure it is within the specified range of 2 to 500, and the function does not return any value. The function's behavior when `n` is not a valid integer is also not handled, leading to potential errors.
