The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is formed from the combination of '7's and '4's and is greater than or equal to `n`, it is possible that `ans` may remain unchanged or could be updated to a new minimum value if `tem` is less than `ans`. However, since the specific values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, we cannot definitively state the new value of `ans`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` remains unchanged or updated to a minimum value, `i` is `l`, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, `tem` is an integer formed from the combination of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` remains unchanged or updated to a minimum value, `i` is `l`, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, `tem` is an integer formed from the combination of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
