The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is formed by joining the elements of `x`, it represents some integer value. The previous value of `ans` is not specified, but it will change based on the comparison with `tem`. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `i`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8; `i` is equal to `l + 3`; `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8; `i` is equal to `l + 3`; `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`.**
