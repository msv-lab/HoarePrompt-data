To determine the required states for the loop to execute, I need to analyze the given information and the loop structure.

1. **Understanding the loop**: The loop is defined with `for x in product('74', repeat=i)`. The `product` function from the `itertools` module generates the Cartesian product of the input iterable, repeated `i` times. The value of `i` is `l + 4`.

2. **State variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. However, `n` does not directly influence the loop execution as it is not referenced in the loop.
   - `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8. The values can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
   - `i` is `l + 4`. Therefore, `i` will be at least 4 (when `l` is 0) and at most 12 (when `l` is 8).
   - The condition for the loop to execute a second time is that `l` must be less than or equal to 6, which means `l` can be 0, 2, 4, or 6. 

3. **Loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is a positive integer. Given that `i` is defined as `l + 4`, it will always be at least 4 based on the provided range for `l`.

4. **Initial state adjustment for the loop**: 
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must be in the range of 0 to 6 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. 
   - The value of `i` will be calculated based on `l`, and since `i` is `l + 4`, it is guaranteed to be valid as long as `l` meets the stated condition.

Given these analyses, the required adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4` (which will be between 4 and 10 inclusive) for the loop to execute.**
