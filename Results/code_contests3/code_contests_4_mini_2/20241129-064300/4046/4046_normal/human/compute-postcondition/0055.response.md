Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4`, and `tem` is an integer formed by joining the characters in `x`. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
