Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8, `i` is equal to `l + 2`, and `ans` is the minimum integer formed by joining the elements of `x` where the count of '7's equals the count of '4's and this integer is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such `tem` exists, `ans` remains unchanged.**
