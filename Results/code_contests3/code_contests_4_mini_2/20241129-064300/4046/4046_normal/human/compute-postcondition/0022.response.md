Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to a minimum value; `i` is `l + 1`; if the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, then `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` remain equal, maintaining the overall state of the program.***
