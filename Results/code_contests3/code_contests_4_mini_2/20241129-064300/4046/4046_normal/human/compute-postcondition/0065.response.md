The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to input a positive integer `n`, which must be between 1 and 10^9. The function then calculates the length `l` of the input integer `n` and ensures that `l` is even by incrementing it if it is odd. 

Next, the function generates combinations of the digits '4' and '7' of increasing lengths starting from `l` up to 10, ensuring that each combination has an equal number of '4's and '7's. For each valid combination, it converts the combination to an integer and checks if it is greater than or equal to `n`. If such an integer is found, the function updates the variable `ans` to the minimum value that meets this condition.

Finally, the function prints the value of `ans`, which will either be the smallest integer formed by equal counts of '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`, or it remains as the initial value of 4444477777 if no such integer exists.

Functionality: ** The function prompts for a positive integer `n`, calculates the smallest integer that can be formed with equal counts of the digits '4' and '7' that is greater than or equal to `n`, and prints this integer. If no such integer can be formed, it prints 4444477777. **
