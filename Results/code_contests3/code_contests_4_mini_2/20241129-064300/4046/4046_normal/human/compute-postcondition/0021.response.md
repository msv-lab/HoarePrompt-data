Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to a minimum value; `i` is `l + 1`; if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `tem` maintains the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` equal, and the overall state of the program reflects this condition.***
