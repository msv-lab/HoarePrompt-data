Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the elements of `x`, and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, while `i` is equal to `l + 2`.***
