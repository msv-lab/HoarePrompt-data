The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, after execution, `n` will hold the value of the input integer within that range. The output state reflects this condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
