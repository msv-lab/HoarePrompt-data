`l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), the new value of `l` will be an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10). The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10); `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10); `ans` is 4444477777**
