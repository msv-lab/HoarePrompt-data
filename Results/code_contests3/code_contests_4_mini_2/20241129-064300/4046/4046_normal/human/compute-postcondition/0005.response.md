According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. The loop runs with `i` starting from `l` and increments by 2 until it reaches 10. Since `l` is given as an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10), the loop can execute if `l` is less than 10. 

If `l` is equal to 10, the loop will not execute as the range will be empty. Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than 10. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to 10, but since we are checking the state before the loop starts, we only need to ensure that `l` is less than 10 and set `i` to its initial value of `l`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is `l`**
