Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` remains unchanged or updated to a minimum value, `i` is `l + 1`, and `tem` is equal to int(''.join(x)) which is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, `tem` is maintained, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to `ans`.***
