Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8; `ans` is the minimum value of `tem` greater than or equal to `n` or remains unchanged; `i` is `l + 2`; the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`; `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the elements of `x`; `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `tem`.**
