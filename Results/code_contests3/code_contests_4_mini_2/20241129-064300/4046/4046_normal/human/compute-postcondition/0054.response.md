Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4`, and `tem` is an integer formed by joining the characters in `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. There is no else part in the code, so no changes occur to `ans` if `tem` is less than `n`.***
