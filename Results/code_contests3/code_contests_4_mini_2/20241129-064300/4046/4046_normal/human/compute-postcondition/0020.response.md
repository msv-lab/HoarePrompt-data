The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is already at least `n` and maintains the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` equal, the output state will reflect the potential update of `ans` without specifying its exact value, as it can remain unchanged or be updated to a new minimum value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; `ans` is either unchanged or updated to a minimum value; `i` is `l + 1`; `tem` is equal to int(''.join(x)) which is greater than or equal to `n`, maintaining the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` equal.**
