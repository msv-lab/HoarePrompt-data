Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8, `i` is equal to `l + 3`, and `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.***
