Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than or equal to 8; `i` is equal to `l + 3`; `tem` is the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`. If `x` has an equal count of '7's and '4's and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. If the counts are not equal, no changes are made to `ans`.***
