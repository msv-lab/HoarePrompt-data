The variable `tem` is assigned the value of the integer conversion of the string formed by joining the elements of `x`. The initial state indicates that the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, but the actual contents of `x` are not specified. Therefore, the precise integer value that `tem` will hold cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `x`. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4` (which is between 4 and 10 inclusive), and the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`; `tem` is an integer formed by joining elements of `x`.**
