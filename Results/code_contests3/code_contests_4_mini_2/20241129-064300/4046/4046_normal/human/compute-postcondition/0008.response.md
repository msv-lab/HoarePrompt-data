The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `x` is generated from `product('74', repeat=i)`, which produces combinations of the characters '7' and '4' repeated `i` times. Since `i` is equal to `l` (an even number less than 10), the variable `x` will contain a specific combination of '7's and '4's where the counts of '7' and '4' are equal.

The exact value of `x` and consequently `tem` depends on the specific combination derived from the product function using the given `l`. However, since `x` consists of '7's and '4's, the value of `tem` will be an integer made up of the digits '7' and '4', resulting in a positive integer.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `tem` is a positive integer formed from the combination of '7's and '4's based on the value of `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` remains unchanged, `i` is `l`, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal; `tem` is an integer formed from the combination of '7's and '4's.**
