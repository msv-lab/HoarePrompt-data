Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` remains unchanged or updated to a minimum value, `i` is `l`, counts of '7' and '4' in `x` are equal, `tem` is an integer formed from the combination of '7's and '4's. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program maintains these conditions.***
