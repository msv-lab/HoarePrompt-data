To analyze the provided code, letâ€™s break down the impact of the line `ans = min(ans, tem)`. 

1. The variable `ans` is being updated to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `tem`.
2. The specific values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `tem` has been assigned a value based on `x`, and `ans` holds an existing value.

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `ans` and `tem`, the output state will indicate that `ans` is being updated based on the minimum calculation.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`**.
