Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4`, and `tem` is assigned the integer value formed by joining the characters in `x` from the previous iteration. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `tem`.***
