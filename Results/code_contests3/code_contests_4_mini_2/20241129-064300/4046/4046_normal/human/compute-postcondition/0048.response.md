`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and there is no information about the previous value of `ans`, we cannot determine the exact outcome of the minimum operation. However, we know that `tem` is definitely greater than or equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4` (which is between 4 and 10 inclusive), the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer formed by joining elements of `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `ans` may or may not have changed depending on its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `l` is an even number less than or equal to 6, `i` is `l + 4` (which is between 4 and 10 inclusive), the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is an integer formed by joining elements of `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is min(`ans`, `tem`).**
