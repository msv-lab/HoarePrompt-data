`tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. The value of `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and it is maintained as per the previous conditions. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and `i` remains `l + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; `ans` remains unchanged or updated to a minimum value; `i` is `l + 1`; `tem` is equal to int(''.join(x)) which is greater than or equal to `n`, maintaining the counts of '7' and '4' in `x` equal.
