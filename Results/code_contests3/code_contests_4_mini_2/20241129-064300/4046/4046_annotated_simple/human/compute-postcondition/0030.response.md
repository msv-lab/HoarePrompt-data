Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8, `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem`, `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is the integer representation of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` may be updated to `tem`.***
