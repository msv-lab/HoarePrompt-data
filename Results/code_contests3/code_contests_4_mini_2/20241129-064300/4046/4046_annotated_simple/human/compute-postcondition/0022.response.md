Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is at least 2, and `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`. If the count of '7's equals the count of '4's in `x`, then `tem` is the integer value of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions regarding the values of `ans` and `tem` remain unchanged.***
