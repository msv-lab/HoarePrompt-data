Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is at least `l`; `ans` is the minimum value among all integers formed by combinations of '7's and '4's with an equal count, which are greater than or equal to `n`. If no such integer exists, `ans` remains unchanged from its initial value.**
