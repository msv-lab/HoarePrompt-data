Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8, and `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem`. If `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's with an equal count of both digits, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` may be updated to `tem`.***
