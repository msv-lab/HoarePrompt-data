Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, and `i` is at least 1. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x` and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. If the count of '7' does not equal the count of '4', no changes are made to `ans`.***
