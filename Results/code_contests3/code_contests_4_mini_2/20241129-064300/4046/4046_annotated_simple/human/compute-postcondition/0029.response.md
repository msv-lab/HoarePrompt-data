`ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` remains unchanged in the initial state, we can conclude that if `tem` is less than `ans`, `ans` will be updated to the value of `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `ans` could either remain unchanged or be updated to `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8, `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem`, `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
