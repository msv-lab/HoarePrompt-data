Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 9; `ans` remains unchanged if no valid `tem` was found; `tem` is an integer formed by joining the elements of `x`. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.***
