In the code snippet, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `tem`. The previous values of the affected variables are `ans` (unknown) and `tem` (an integer value based on the string formed by `x`). Since `tem` is calculated from `x`, which is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`, this means that `tem` represents a specific integer value derived from that combination.

The output state reflects the relationship between `ans` and `tem` after the execution of the code. Since the exact values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, it can only be stated that the minimum between them is computed.

Output State: **`ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `tem`**
