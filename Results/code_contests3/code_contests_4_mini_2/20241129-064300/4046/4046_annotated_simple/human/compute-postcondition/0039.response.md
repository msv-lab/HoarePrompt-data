Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than 10; `i` is 10; `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem`; `x` contains equal counts of the digits '7' and '4'; `tem` is not assigned a valid integer value from `x`; if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program's state retains these conditions; `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem` as `tem` has not been assigned a valid integer value.**
