Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 10; `ans` may be updated based on the validity of `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, where `tem` is the integer value created by joining the elements of `x`. If no valid `tem` was found, `ans` remains unchanged.***
