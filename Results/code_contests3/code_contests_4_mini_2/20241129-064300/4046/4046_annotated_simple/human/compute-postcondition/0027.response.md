The variable `x` is a combination generated from `product('74', repeat=8)`, which means `x` consists of strings made up of the digits '7' and '4' repeated 8 times. The statement `tem = int(''.join(x))` converts the joined string representation of `x` into an integer. Since `x` contains an equal count of '7' and '4', it is a valid representation of a number. 

The specific value of `tem` will depend on the exact layout of `x`, but since the exact digits in `x` are unknown, we can only confirm that `tem` will be a valid integer derived from the combination of '7's and '4's.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8, `ans` remains unchanged, `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's, and `tem` is the integer representation of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8, `ans` remains unchanged, `x` is a combination of '7's and '4's, `tem` is the integer representation of `x`.**
