The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` can be either 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 (odd numbers), after the increment, `l` will become either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 (even numbers). The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10; `ans` is 4444477777.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is either 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10; `ans` is 4444477777**.
