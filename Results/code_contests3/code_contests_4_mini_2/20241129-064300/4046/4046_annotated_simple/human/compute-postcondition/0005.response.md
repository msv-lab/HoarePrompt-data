According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `l`. The loop starts at `l` and increments by 2 on each iteration until it reaches 10. 

For the loop to execute:
1. If `l` is odd (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9), the loop will execute at least once since it starts at `l` (which is less than 10).
2. If `l` is even (2, 4, 6, 8, or 10), the loop will also execute as long as `l` is less than 10.

Given that `l` is either an odd or even integer, it must be less than 10 for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes, `l` should be any integer less than 10, and `i` should start at the value of `l`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is `l`**
