According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit set by `l`. Since `i` is at least `l` and the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than 10. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `l` and less than 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased by 2. 

If `i` was at least `l` and less than 10, it can be at most 8 (since the next increment would make it 10, which is outside the loop's range). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 10 after the increment, which means `i` can be 8 before the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8; `ans` remains unchanged.**
