Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than or equal to 8, `i` is 10, and `ans` remains unchanged if no valid `tem` was found. If the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's, and if `tem`, formed by joining the elements of `x`, is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
