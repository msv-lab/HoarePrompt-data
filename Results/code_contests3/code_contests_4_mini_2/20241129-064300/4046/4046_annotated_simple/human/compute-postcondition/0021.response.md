Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is at least 2, `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`, and `tem` is the integer value of the string formed by `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. If `tem` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
