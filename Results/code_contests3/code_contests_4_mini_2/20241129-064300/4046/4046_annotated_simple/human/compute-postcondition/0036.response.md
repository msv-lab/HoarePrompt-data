Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 9, and `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem`. If `x` contains equal counts of the digits '7' and '4', and `tem` is not assigned a valid integer value from `x`, if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program's state retains these conditions, while `ans` may be updated to `tem`.***
