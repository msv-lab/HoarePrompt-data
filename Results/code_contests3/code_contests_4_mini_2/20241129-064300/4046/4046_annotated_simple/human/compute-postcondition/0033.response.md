The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` must be a combination of '7's and '4's with equal counts of both digits of length 9. Given that there are 9 digits in total and the count of '7's and '4's must be equal, this is not possible as they cannot form an equal count with an odd total. Therefore, `x` cannot form a valid combination, and `tem` will not be assigned a valid integer value from `x`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 9, `ans` remains unchanged or is updated to `tem`, and `tem` is not assigned a valid integer value from `x`.**
