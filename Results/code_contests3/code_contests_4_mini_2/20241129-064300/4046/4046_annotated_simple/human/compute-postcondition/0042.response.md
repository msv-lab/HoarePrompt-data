Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 8 or 9 or 10 depending on the maximum number of iterations, and `ans` is the minimum integer representation of combinations of '7's and '4's with equal counts of both digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, or remains unchanged if no valid `tem` was found.**
