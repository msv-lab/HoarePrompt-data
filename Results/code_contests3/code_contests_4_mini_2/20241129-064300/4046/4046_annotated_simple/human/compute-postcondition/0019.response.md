The value of `tem` is assigned the integer value of the string formed by joining the characters in `x`. The variable `x` is defined as a combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`, which means `x` is a string consisting of the characters '7' and '4'. Therefore, `tem` will hold the integer representation of that string. The values of `n`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than 10; `i` is at least 2; `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`; `tem` is the integer value of the string formed by `x`.**
