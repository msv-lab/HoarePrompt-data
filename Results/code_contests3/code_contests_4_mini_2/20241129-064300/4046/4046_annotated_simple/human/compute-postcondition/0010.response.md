The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The variable `tem` holds a value that is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is also a positive integer. Since the exact values of `ans` and `tem` are not specified, the output state will indicate that `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to min(`ans`, `tem`) where `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`**
