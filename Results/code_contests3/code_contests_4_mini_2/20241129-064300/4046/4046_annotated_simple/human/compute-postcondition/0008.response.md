The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, where `x` is a combination generated by `product('74', repeat=i)`. Given that `x` is defined such that the count of '7' equals the count of '4', `''.join(x)` will create a string representation of that combination. The function `int()` will then convert this string into an integer.

Since `x` represents a valid combination of '7' and '4' that maintains the balance of counts, the resulting integer will be a positive integer formed by the digits '7' and '4'.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is `l`, `i` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `x` is the first combination generated by product('74', repeat=i) where the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is `l`, `i` is at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time, `x` is the first combination generated by product('74', repeat=i) where the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`, `tem` is the integer value of the joined string representation of `x`.**
