The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The previous value of `n` is replaced by this new input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is updated to an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is updated to an input integer**
