According to the code, the loop iterates over all possible combinations of '7's and '4's of length `i`. The variable `i` is at least 2, and the loop will execute once for each combination of length `i`, which is determined by the `product` function. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, meaning the loop has executed for combinations of length 2. The next iteration will correspond to the next combination of length `i`. Since `i` is not specified to change within the loop, it remains the same. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to stay the same, and we need to consider the next combination generated by `product`. Given that `l` is less than 10, `x` will be formed by 2 elements (either '7' or '4'), which will continue until all combinations are exhausted. 

Since `x` is formed by the `product` function, we can assume that it will generate combinations until all possible arrangements of '7's and '4's of length `i` have been exhausted. The next combination will be the next in line.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` remains the same.
- We do not need to update `tem` or `ans` based on the loop's conditions as these are part of the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than 10; `i` is at least 2; `x` is the next combination of '7's and '4's of length `i`.**
