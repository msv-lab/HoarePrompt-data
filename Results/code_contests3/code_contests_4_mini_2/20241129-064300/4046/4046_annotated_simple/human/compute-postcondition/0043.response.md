According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` which iterates from `l` to 10 with a step of 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` can be either 8, 9, or 10. Since `l` is less than 10 and we need to prepare for the next iteration, we need to consider the value of `i` and how it will change in the next iteration.

If `i` is 8, it will increment to 10 for the next iteration, which is the upper limit and thus the loop will not execute again.  
If `i` is 9, it will increment to 11, which is also outside the range and the loop will not execute again.  
If `i` is 10, it means the loop has reached its end and will not execute again.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 8 to 9, or from 9 to 10, or from 10 to 11, but since all these values have been considered, we conclude that the loop cannot execute again.

Thus, if we assume `i` is 8, it can become 9 for the next iteration, and since `l` is less than 10, it can be anything less than 10, but for clarity, we set it to a value less than 10 such as 9.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is less than 10, `i` is 9, `ans` remains unchanged if no valid `tem` was found; for the loop to execute a second time, `l` must be 8 or less.**
