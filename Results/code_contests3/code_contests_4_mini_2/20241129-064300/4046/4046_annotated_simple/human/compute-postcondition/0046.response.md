The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. This means `x` is being joined into a string and then converted into an integer. The output state indicates that the value of `tem` is now a positive integer formed by the concatenation of the elements in `x`. Since `x` is derived from a previous execution of a loop, its exact value is not known here, but it's implied that it results in a valid integer. The variable `ans` remains unchanged if no valid `tem` was found, but since we are assigning to `tem`, we assume it is valid.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that `tem` has been assigned a new value based on `x`, while `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is less than or equal to 8; `i` is 9; `ans` remains unchanged; `tem` is an integer formed by joining the elements of `x`.**
