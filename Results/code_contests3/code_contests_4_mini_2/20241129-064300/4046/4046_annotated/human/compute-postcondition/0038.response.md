The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the list `x` into a string and then into an integer. The previous values of the variable `x` are not provided, so the specific value of `tem` cannot be determined. The other variables `n`, `l`, and `ans` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state indicates the impact of the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`; `tem` is an integer formed from the list `x`.**
