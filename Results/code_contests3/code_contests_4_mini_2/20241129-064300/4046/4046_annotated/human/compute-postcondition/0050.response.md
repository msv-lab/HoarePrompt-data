Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits. If `x` contains equal counts of '7' and '4', then `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`, where `tem` is the integer formed from the string `x`, if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `tem` is less than `n`, no update occurs to `ans`.***
