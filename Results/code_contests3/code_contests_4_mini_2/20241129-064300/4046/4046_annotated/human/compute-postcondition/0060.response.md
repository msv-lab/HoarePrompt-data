Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `i` is increased by 1. If the count of '7' in `x` is equal to the count of '4' in `x`, then `tem` is assigned the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`, and if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. There is no else part to consider.***
