Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`; `i` is incremented by 1; `tem` is assigned the value of the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `x`.***
