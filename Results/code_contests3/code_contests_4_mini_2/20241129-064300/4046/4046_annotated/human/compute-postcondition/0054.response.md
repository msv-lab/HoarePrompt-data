Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `tem` is assigned from the integer formed by joining the list `x` into a string.***
