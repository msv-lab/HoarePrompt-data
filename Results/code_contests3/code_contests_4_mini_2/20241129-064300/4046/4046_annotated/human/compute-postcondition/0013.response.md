According to the code, the loop iterates over the Cartesian product of the characters '7' and '4' repeated `i` times. The loop will execute again if `i` is increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value determining the length of the strings being generated by the product function.

Since `x` is formed by repeating '7' and '4', for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. The count of '7' and '4' in `x` will still be equal as the product will generate all combinations of '7' and '4' of length `i + 1`. 

The variable `ans` remains unchanged for the next iteration since it is initialized to 4444477777, and it will only be updated based on the comparison with `tem`, which is derived from the concatenation of digits in `x`. However, to evaluate `tem` for the next iteration, we need to ensure that the count of '7' and '4' still remains equal. 

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, the states need to be modified as follows:

- `i` is increased by 1.
- The count of '7' and '4' will continue to be equal for the new `x`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is initialized to 4444477777, for the loop to execute again `i` must be incremented by 1.**
