The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` is stated to be an odd number, after the increment, `l` will become an even number. The values of `n` and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is now an even number; `ans` is 4444477777. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is now an even number; `ans` is 4444477777**.
