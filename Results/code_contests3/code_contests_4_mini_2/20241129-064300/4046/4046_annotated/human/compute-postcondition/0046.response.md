The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which means the string `x` is concatenated into a single string and then converted to an integer. The output state depends on the content of the string `x`, which contains equal counts of '7' and '4' digits. Since the specific content of `x` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. However, we can state that `tem` is now an integer formed from the digits in `x`.

Output State: **`tem` is an integer formed from the string `x`, which contains equal counts of '7' and '4' digits.**
