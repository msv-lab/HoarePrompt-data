The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The initial state indicates that `ans` is already the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`. The value of `tem` is determined from the list `x`, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, the precise new value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing `tem`. Thus, we can only state that `ans` is updated based on the comparison with `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`**.
