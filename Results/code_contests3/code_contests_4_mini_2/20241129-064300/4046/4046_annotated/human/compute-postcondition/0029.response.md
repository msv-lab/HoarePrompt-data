The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Given that `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, the updated value of `ans` will depend on the comparison between its current value and `tem`. 

Since `tem` is also greater than or equal to `n`, it does not affect the assumption that `ans` could potentially be less than `tem`, but we cannot know the exact values without further details about `ans` and `tem`. Thus, we will state that `ans` will take the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `i` is `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer formed from the string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, `i` is `l + 2`, `tem` is an integer formed from the string `x`, and `tem` is greater than or equal to `n.**
