According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `l` to 10, incrementing `i` by 2 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than 10 since `l` is an even number less than 8 (which means the maximum it can be is 6). 

If `l` is 6, the next value of `i` would be 8, and if `l` is 4, the next value of `i` would be 6. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will take on the next even value until it reaches 10. 

Thus, the conditions for the next iteration are:
- If `l` is 6, then `i` will be 8.
- If `l` is 4, then `i` will be 6.

In both cases, `i` must be less than 10.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` is 8 if `l` is 6 or `i` is 6 if `l` is 4.**
