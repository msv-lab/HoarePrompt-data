The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum between its current value and the value of `tem`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified for `ans` and `tem`, but we know that `tem` has been assigned a value formed by joining the elements of `x`, and `ans` remains unchanged unless it is greater than `tem`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 8; `i` is increased by 1; `tem` is assigned the value of the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 8; `i` is increased by 1; `tem` is assigned the value of the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
