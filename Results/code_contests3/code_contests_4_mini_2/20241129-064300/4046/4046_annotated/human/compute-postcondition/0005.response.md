According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l`. The loop iterates starting from `l` and continues as long as `i` is less than 10, incrementing `i` by 2 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than 10. 

Before the loop starts, `ans` is set to 4444477777, which does not influence the execution of the loop directly. The important condition is that `l` is even (if it started as odd) and `l` is less than 10.

Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be set to an even number less than 10, which could be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, `ans` is 4444477777, and for the loop to execute the first time, `l` is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.**
