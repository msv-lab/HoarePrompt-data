According to the code, the loop iterates through the range starting at `l` and increments by 2 until it is less than 10. Since `l` is an even number less than 10, the possible values for `i` in the next iteration will be `l + 2`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `l`, which is an even number less than 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `l + 2`, and for that, `l` must be less than 8 (the next even number below 10). 

Thus, we need to state that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be `l + 2`, and `l` must be an even number less than 8. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`**
