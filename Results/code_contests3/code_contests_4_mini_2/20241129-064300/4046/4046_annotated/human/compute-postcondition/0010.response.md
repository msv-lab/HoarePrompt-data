The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. The variable `tem` is an integer that is derived from the concatenation of digits in `x`, and it is greater than or equal to `n`. Since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `ans`, but we know it will be either the current value of `ans` or `tem` (which is greater than or equal to `n`). Therefore, the output state is: `tem` is an integer derived from the concatenation of digits in `x`, which is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.

Output State: **`tem` is an integer derived from the concatenation of digits in `x`, which is greater than or equal to `n`; `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.**
