Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `i` is increased by 1, and `tem` is assigned the value of the integer formed by joining the elements of `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`. There is no else part to consider.***
