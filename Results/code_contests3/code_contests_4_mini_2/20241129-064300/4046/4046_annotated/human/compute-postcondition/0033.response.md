The code assigns the value of `tem` by converting a list of characters `x` into a string and then into an integer. The character list `x` is not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output state remains dependent on the unknown list `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, `tem` is an integer formed from the characters in `x`.**
