The value of `ans` is assigned the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Given that `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, and `tem` is an integer formed from the characters in `x`, the final value of `ans` will depend on the actual values of `ans` and `tem`.

Since we do not have the specific values for `ans` and `tem`, we cannot determine an exact numerical output state. However, we can conclude the following:

- If `tem` is lower than the current `ans`, then `ans` will be updated to that value.
- If `tem` is greater than or equal to `ans`, then `ans` will remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state reflects the comparison and potential updating of `ans` based on `tem`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`.**
