Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 10, and `ans` is initialized to 4444477777. If the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4', then `tem`, derived from the concatenation of digits in `x`, is evaluated: if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`; if `tem` is less than `n`, `ans` remains unchanged.***
