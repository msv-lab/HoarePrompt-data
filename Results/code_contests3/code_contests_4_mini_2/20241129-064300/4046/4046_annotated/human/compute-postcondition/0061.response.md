Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`. If no such integers exist, `ans` remains as 4444477777. If the loop does not execute, `ans` remains as the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' that are greater than or equal to `n` for the given `i`.**
