The variable `tem` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`, which converts the string `x` into an integer. The string `x` contains an equal number of '7' and '4' digits, but the specific content of `x` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `tem`. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, and `tem` is an integer formed from the string `x`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `l + 2`, and `tem` is an integer formed from the string `x`.**
