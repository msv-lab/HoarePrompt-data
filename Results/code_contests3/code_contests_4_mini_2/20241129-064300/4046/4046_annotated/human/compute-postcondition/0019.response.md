To analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables based on the initial state:

1. The variable `tem` is being assigned the value of `int(''.join(x))`. This means that `tem` will be formed by concatenating the elements of the iterable `x` into a single string and then converting that string to an integer.

2. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine what `tem` will specifically be. However, it is clear that `tem` is updated to an integer value created from `x`.

3. The other variables (`n`, `l`, `ans`, `i`) are not impacted by this specific line of code, as they are not modified or reassigned.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `tem` has been updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; `ans` remains unchanged; `i` remains unchanged; `tem` is formed by concatenating the elements of `x` into an integer.**
