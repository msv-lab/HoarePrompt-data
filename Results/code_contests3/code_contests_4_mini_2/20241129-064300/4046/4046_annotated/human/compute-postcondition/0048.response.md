The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`. Since `tem` is an integer formed from the string `x` and is greater than or equal to `n`, it will be compared with the current value of `ans`. The exact values of `ans` and `tem` are not provided, but `ans` will be adjusted accordingly. Therefore, the Output State reflects the comparison and potential update of `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `tem`, where `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
