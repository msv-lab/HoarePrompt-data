According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop will iterate for every combination of '7' and '4' with a length of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is set to `l + 2`. Since `l` is an even number less than 8, the possible values for `l` are 0, 2, 4, or 6. Thus, `i` can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. After the last iteration, the next value of `i` will be `l + 2 + 1`, which is one greater than the previous value. Therefore, if `l` is less than 6, `i` will be 3, 5, 7, or 9, respectively, for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time `i` will be set to `l + 3`.**
