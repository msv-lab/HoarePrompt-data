Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; if the count of '7's in `x` is equal to the count of '4's in `x`, then `ans` remains unchanged unless `tem` (formed by concatenating the elements of `x` into an integer) is greater than or equal to `n`, in which case `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem`.***
