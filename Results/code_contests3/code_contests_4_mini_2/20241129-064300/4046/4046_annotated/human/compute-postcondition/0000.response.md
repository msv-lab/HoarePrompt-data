The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state will contain the updated value of `n` based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
