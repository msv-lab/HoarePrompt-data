Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `l` is an even number less than 10; and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `tem` if `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and `tem` is assigned the value of the integer formed by concatenating the elements of `x` if the count of '7' in `x` equals the count of '4' in `x`.***
