Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`. If `x` contains an equal count of '7' and '4', then `tem` is the integer formed from the string `x`. If `tem` is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`, and `i` is set to `l + 2`. Otherwise, there is no update to `ans` or `i`.***
