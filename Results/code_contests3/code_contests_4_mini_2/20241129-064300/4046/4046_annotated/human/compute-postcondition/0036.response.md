Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `ans` is the minimum of 4444477777 and all integers formed from equal counts of '7' and '4' digits that are greater than or equal to `n`. If `x` contains an equal count of '7' and '4' digits and `tem` (an integer formed from the characters in `x`) is greater than or equal to `n`, then `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
