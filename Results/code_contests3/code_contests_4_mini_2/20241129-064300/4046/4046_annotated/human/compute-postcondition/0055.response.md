Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `l` is an even number less than 8, and `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `tem` if `x` contains an equal count of '7' and '4'. The value of `tem` is assigned from the integer formed by joining the list `x` into a string and is considered only if it is greater than or equal to `n`.***
