The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) from user input. It calculates the smallest integer composed of equal counts of the digits '4' and '7', which is greater than or equal to `n`. If `n` has an odd number of digits, the function adjusts the digit count to the next even number before generating potential candidates. The function outputs the smallest valid integer found or defaults to 4444477777 if no valid integer is found.
