Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to shift each character of the input string by the specified integer N in alphabetical order. It handles the wrap-around from 'Z' to 'A' by using the modulus operator (`% 26`). 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. It reads the integer `n` and the string `strings` from input.
2. It defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
3. For each character in `strings`, it finds the index of that character in `letters`.
4. It calculates the new index by adding `n` to the original index and then applying modulus 26 to ensure it wraps around correctly.
5. It constructs the resulting string by appending the shifted characters.

The program meets all the constraints outlined in the problem description, and it correctly handles edge cases such as shifting by 0 (which results in the original string) and shifting characters that wrap around past 'Z'. 

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
