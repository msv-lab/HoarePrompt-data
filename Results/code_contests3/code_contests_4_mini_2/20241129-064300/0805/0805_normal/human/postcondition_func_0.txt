The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It transforms `strings` by shifting each character forward in the alphabet by `n` positions, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. The transformed string is then printed. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values for `n` or characters in `strings` that are not uppercase English letters, and it also does not limit the value of `n` to be within the specified range of 0 to 26, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
