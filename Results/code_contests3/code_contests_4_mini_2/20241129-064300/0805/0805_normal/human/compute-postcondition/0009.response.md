The variable `new_strings` is updated by appending the value of `new_s` to it. The values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, `letters`, `s`, `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` remain unchanged except for `new_strings`, which now includes the character `new_s`.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is `new_strings + new_s`, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character from `letters` at position `new_index`**
