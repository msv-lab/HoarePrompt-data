To determine the output state after the execution of the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the program's variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `new_strings` was previously defined to concatenate with `new_s`.
2. The variable `new_s` is derived from the character at `letters[new_index]`, which is calculated based on the previous steps involving the indices and the integer `n`.
3. The operation `new_strings += new_s` updates `new_strings` by appending the value of `new_s` to it.

Since the operation modifies `new_strings` by adding `new_s`, the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, we will reflect this change in our output state.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is `new_strings + new_s`, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at `letters[new_index]`**
