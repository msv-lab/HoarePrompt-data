To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and how it interacts with the existing variables.

1. The variable `added_index` is already defined as `index + n`.
2. The code snippet calculates `new_index` as `added_index % 26`.
3. The variable `index` is the position of `s` (the second character of `strings`) in the `letters` string ('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ').
4. The value of `n` is given as an integer in the range from 0 to 26.

Since `new_index` is computed from `added_index`, its value would directly depend on the previous values of `index` and `n`. The other variables (`S`, `N`, `strings`, `letters`, `new_strings`, `s`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will include the values of the variables that were affected by this calculation.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is `new_strings + new_s`, `s` is the second character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
