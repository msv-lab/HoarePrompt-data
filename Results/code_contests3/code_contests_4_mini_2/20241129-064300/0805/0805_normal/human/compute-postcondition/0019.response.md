`new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The value of `added_index` can be expressed as `2 + n`, where `n` is an integer from 0 to 26. Therefore, the possible values of `added_index` range from 2 to 28. The modulo operation will yield results as follows:

- If `added_index` is 2, `new_index` is 2 % 26 = 2
- If `added_index` is 3, `new_index` is 3 % 26 = 3
- ...
- If `added_index` is 28, `new_index` is 28 % 26 = 2

Thus, the possible values of `new_index` based on the range of `added_index` can be from 0 to 25, and the values will repeat for `added_index` values beyond 26. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is either 2 + n (where 0 <= n <= 26); `new_index` is either from 0 to 25.

Output State: **`added_index` is either 2 + n (where 0 <= n <= 26); `new_index` is either from 0 to 25**
