`new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`. The value of `new_index` can be any integer from 0 to 25, which corresponds to the indices of the `letters` string (assuming it represents the alphabet). The value of `added_index` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is either 2 + n (where 0 <= n <= 26); `new_index` is either from 0 to 25; `new_s` is an element from `letters` corresponding to `new_index`.

Output State: **`added_index` is either 2 + n (where 0 <= n <= 26); `new_index` is either from 0 to 25; `new_s` is an element from `letters` corresponding to `new_index`**.
