The loop iterates over each character in the input string `strings`. For each character, it calculates a new character based on the provided integer `n`. The final result is stored in `new_strings`, which will contain the transformed version of `strings` after applying the specified shifting logic for all characters.

If `strings` is non-empty, after all iterations of the loop:
- `new_strings` will be a string that consists of each character in `strings` shifted by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.
- `S` remains a string, as it was initially.
- `N` remains an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, as it was initially.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `letters` will still be 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `strings` will remain unchanged as the input string.
- The values of `index`, `added_index`, `new_index`, and `new_s` are not relevant after the completion of all iterations since they are scoped within the loop.

If `strings` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `new_strings` remains an empty string.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is the string formed by shifting each character in `strings` by `n`.**
