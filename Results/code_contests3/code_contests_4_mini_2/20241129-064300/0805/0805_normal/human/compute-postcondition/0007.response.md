The value of `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The variable `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`, where `index` is the index of the character `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer. Since `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, the value of `added_index` will also be valid within the range of possible indices for `letters`. The output state will reflect the calculations for `new_index`, but the exact value cannot be determined without specific values for `s`, `index`, and `n`.

Output State: **`S` is a string, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of strings, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
