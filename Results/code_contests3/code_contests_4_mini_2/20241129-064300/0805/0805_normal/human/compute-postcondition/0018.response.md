The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The value of `index` is previously determined to be 2, and `n` is an input integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be equal to `2 + n`. The value of `added_index` is dependent on the value of `n`, which is an input integer.

Since `n` can vary within the specified range, `added_index` can take on any value from 2 to 28 (when `n` is 26). The output state will reflect this variability.

Output State: **`added_index` is either 2 + n, where n is an input integer such that 0 <= n <= 26.**
