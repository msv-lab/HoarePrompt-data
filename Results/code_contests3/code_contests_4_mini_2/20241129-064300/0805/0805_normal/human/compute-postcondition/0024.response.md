The function `func` accepts two parameters: `S` and `N`. `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, and `N` is an integer such that \(0 \leq N \leq 26\). The length of `S` is between 1 and \(10^4\). The function performs operations based on the values of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `S` of uppercase English letters and an integer `N` (where 0 <= N <= 26), and outputs a result based on the transformation or manipulation of the string `S` according to the integer `N`.**
