The value of `new_strings` is concatenated with `new_s`. The value of `new_s` corresponds to an element from `letters`, and since `new_index` is between 0 and 25, `new_s` will be one of those elements. The previous value of `new_strings` is unknown, but it will be updated to include `new_s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `added_index` is either 2 + n (where 0 <= n <= 26); `new_index` is either from 0 to 25; `new_s` is an element from `letters` corresponding to `new_index`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s`.

Output State: **`added_index` is either 2 + n (where 0 <= n <= 26); `new_index` is either from 0 to 25; `new_s` is an element from `letters` corresponding to `new_index`; `new_strings` is updated to include `new_s.**
