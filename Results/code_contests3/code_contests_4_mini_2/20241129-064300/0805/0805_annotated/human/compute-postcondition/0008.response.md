To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code line, which assigns a new value to `new_s`.

1. The variable `new_index` is derived from the previous calculations, specifically `added_index` which is calculated as `index + n`, and then it is taken modulo 26. 
2. The variable `s` is the first character of `strings`, and `index` is its position in the `letters` string (which consists of the uppercase letters A-Z).
3. The resulting `new_index` is then used to access the `letters` string to get the character at that position, which is assigned to `new_s`.

Since `new_s` is assigned a value based on the previous states of `s`, `index`, and `n`, we can state that:

- `s` corresponds to the first character of `strings`.
- `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` is the sum of `index` and `n`.
- `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

After executing the line of code, `new_s` will hold the value of `letters[new_index]`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at `letters[new_index]`.**
