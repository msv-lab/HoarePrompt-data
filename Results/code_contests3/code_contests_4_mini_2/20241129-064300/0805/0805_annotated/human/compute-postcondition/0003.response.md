The code initializes `new_strings` as an empty string. It does not affect the values of `S`, `N`, `n`, `strings`, or `letters`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables along with the new initialization.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is an input string; `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string**.
