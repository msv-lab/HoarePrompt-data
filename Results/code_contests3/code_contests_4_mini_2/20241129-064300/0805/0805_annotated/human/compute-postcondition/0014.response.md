To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and how it affects the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `new_index` is calculated as `added_index % 26`.
2. The variable `new_s` is assigned the value from the `letters` string at the position `new_index`.

Given the initial state:
- `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26.
- `s` is the second character of `S`, which means `s = S[1]`.
- `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, which means `index = letters.index(s)`.
- `added_index` is `index + N`.
- `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

After running the code snippet:
- `new_s` will be a character from `letters` based on the value of `new_index`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the derived values based on the calculations and the assignments made.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `s` is the second character of `S`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + N`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character from `letters` at position `new_index`.**
