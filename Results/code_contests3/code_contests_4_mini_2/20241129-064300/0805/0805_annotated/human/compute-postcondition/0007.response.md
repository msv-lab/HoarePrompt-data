To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the variables involved.

1. `added_index` is already defined as `index + n`. 
2. `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `index` and `n`, we cannot provide exact values for `added_index` or `new_index`. However, we can express their relationships based on the initial state.

The calculation for `new_index` does not alter any other variables, and only the value of `new_index` is produced based on the operation.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationships among the variables and the expression used to calculate `new_index`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `s` is the first character of `strings`, `index` is the index of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
