The variable `new_index` is assigned the value of `added_index % 26`. The previous value of `added_index` is defined as `index + N`, which is determined by the position of `s` in `letters` and the value of `N`. Since `N` is non-negative and can be between 0 and 26, the value of `added_index` will also be non-negative and can range from `index` to `index + 26`. The modulo operation ensures that `new_index` wraps around within the range of 0 to 25.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `new_index` is the result of `added_index` wrapped around 26, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `s` is the second character of `S`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + N`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.**
