The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a string `strings` consisting of uppercase English letters. It shifts each character in `strings` by `n` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The output is the transformed string where each character is replaced by the character that is `n` positions further along in the alphabet. If `n` is 0, the output will be the same as the input string. The function does not take parameters directly; instead, it reads them from user input.
