Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes an integer `N` and a string `S`, and shifts each character in `S` by `N` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.

### Explanation of the Code's Correctness:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `N` and a string `S` from standard input, which corresponds to the problem's input requirements.

2. **Character Shifting**:
   - The program defines a string `letters` containing all uppercase English letters.
   - For each character `s` in the input string `S`, it finds the index of `s` in `letters`.
   - It calculates the new index by adding `N` to the current index and using modulo 26 to wrap around the alphabet if the index exceeds 25 (the index of `Z`).

3. **Output Construction**: The program constructs the new shifted string by appending each shifted character to `new_strings` and prints the final result.

### Edge Cases:
- **N = 0**: The output is the same as the input, which is correctly handled by the program.
- **N = 26**: The output should also be the same as the input because shifting by 26 brings each letter back to itself. The program correctly handles this due to the modulo operation.
- **Wrap Around**: The program successfully wraps from `Z` back to `A` when needed (e.g., shifting `Y` by 3 results in `B`).

Given these points, I could not identify any potential cases where the program fails to perform as specified in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
