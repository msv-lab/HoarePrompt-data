The value of `added_index` is used to compute `new_index` by taking `added_index % 26`. Since `added_index` is `index + n`, the value of `new_index` will be determined by the specific values of `index` and `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least one more character, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` has at least one more character, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26**
