To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the variables involved:

- `s` is the next character in `strings`.
- `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, which is assumed to be a string containing all uppercase English letters.
- `added_index` is calculated as `index + n`.
- `new_index` is derived from `added_index % 26`, ensuring it wraps around if it exceeds 25 (the last index of uppercase English letters).
- Finally, `new_s` is assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `s`, `index`, or `n`, we cannot calculate exact values for `new_s`. However, we can express the relationship.

Thus, the output state will reflect these relationships without specific values:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26, and `new_s` is letters[new_index].**
