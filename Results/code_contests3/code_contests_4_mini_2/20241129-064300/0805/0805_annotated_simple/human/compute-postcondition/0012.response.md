The variable `added_index` is assigned the value of `index + n`. The previous values of `index` and `n` are known: `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, and `n` is an input integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26. Therefore, `added_index` will be the value of `index` increased by `n`. The states of the other variables (`S`, `N`, `strings`, `s`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`.**
