The value of `new_index` is assigned the result of `added_index % 26`. The variable `added_index` is derived from `index + n`, where `index` is the position of `s` in `letters` and `n` is an input integer. Since `0 <= N <= 26`, `added_index` will yield a value between `0` and `51` (if `index` is at its maximum with `N = 26`). The modulo operation with 26 will ensure that `new_index` wraps around to stay within the range of valid indices for the English alphabet.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, and `new_index` is `added_index % 26`.

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `s` is the next character in `strings`, `index` is the position of `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26**.
