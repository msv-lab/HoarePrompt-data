To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the assignment to `new_s`.

1. `new_index` is calculated using the expression `added_index % 26`. 
2. `added_index` is defined as `index + n`. 
3. `index` is the index of the character `s` in `letters`, where `letters` contains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
4. `new_s` is then assigned the value of `letters[new_index]`, which corresponds to the character at the position `new_index` in the `letters` string.

Therefore, the output state after executing the line `new_s = letters[new_index]` will reflect the following:

- `S` remains a string consisting of uppercase English letters.
- `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `strings` is a non-empty string.
- `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
- `new_strings` remains an empty string.
- `index` holds the index of the character `s` in `letters`.
- `added_index` is equal to `index + n`.
- `new_index` is equal to `added_index % 26`.
- `new_s` is assigned the character from `letters` at the position `new_index`.

Since `new_s` is directly determined by the value of `new_index`, the exact character will depend on the specific values of `s`, `n`, and consequently `index`. 

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **`S` is a string consisting of uppercase English letters, `N` is an integer such that 0 <= `N` <= 26, `n` is an input integer, `strings` is a non-empty string, `letters` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `new_strings` is an empty string, `index` is the index of the character `s` in `letters`, `added_index` is `index + n`, `new_index` is `added_index % 26`, `new_s` is the character at position `new_index` in `letters`**.
