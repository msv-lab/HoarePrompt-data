Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `S` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `N` (0 <= N <= 26) from user input, then shifts each character in `S` forward by `N` positions in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. The function outputs the transformed string based on these shifts. However, it does not handle invalid input cases such as non-uppercase letters or invalid integer values for `N`. **
