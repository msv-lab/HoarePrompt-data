Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the minimum distance AtCoDeer needs to travel to deliver gifts to all houses. 

The program computes the distance as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates of the houses, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem. The problem states that AtCoDeer can start and end his travel at any positions, and thus the minimum distance is actually the distance between the farthest two houses, which is equivalent to the distance from the leftmost house to the rightmost house.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
2 3 7 9
```

The correct minimum travel distance should be `9 - 2 = 7`, which the program computes correctly. However, consider another case:

```
3
1 1 1
```

In this case, the minimum distance should be `0`, since AtCoDeer can start and end at the same house. The program, however, would compute:

```python
N = 3
a = [1, 1, 1]
ans = np.abs(np.max([1, 1, 1]) - np.min([1, 1, 1]))  # which results in 0
print(ans)
```

This will yield `0`, which is correct in this specific case, but it doesn't handle the general requirement that he can start and end anywhere. 

To illustrate further, consider the case with no houses (if it were allowed by the constraints):

```
0
```

The program would fail since it assumes there are always houses to calculate the distance between.

Thus, since the logic does not comprehensively cover all edge cases, I conclude that the program is incorrect.
