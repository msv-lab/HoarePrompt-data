Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Reading Input**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.
  
2. **Data Type Handling**: The values read from input are strings and need to be converted to integers before calculating the maximum and minimum. The program is currently using `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` directly on the list of strings, which will not yield the correct results. It should convert the list to integers first.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the distance as the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values. However, this is not explicitly stated as the "minimum distance to be traveled" since the function does not verify whether the input matches the expected number of houses (`N`). If fewer or more integers are given than specified by `N`, the function will not handle this case properly.

4. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result directly rather than returning it, which could be considered a deviation from the expected functionality if a return value is anticipated.

Due to these reasons, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and can fail in various scenarios, such as incorrect input format or incorrect data type handling.
