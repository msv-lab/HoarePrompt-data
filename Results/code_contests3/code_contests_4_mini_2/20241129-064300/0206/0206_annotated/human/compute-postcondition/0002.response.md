In the provided code, `ans` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. The list `a` consists of `N` integers, where `N` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. 

The values of `np.max(a)` and `np.min(a)` will be determined based on the contents of the list `a`. Consequently, `ans` will be calculated as the absolute difference.

Since the specific values of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numeric value of `ans`, but we can describe the relationship:

- `ans` will be a non-negative integer since it is derived from the absolute value of the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `ans` has been computed based on the maximum and minimum values of `a`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `N` integers; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a`.**
