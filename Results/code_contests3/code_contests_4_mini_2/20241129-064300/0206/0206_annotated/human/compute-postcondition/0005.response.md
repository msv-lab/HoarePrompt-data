Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) and a list of N integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). It calculates the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints this difference. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the input may not conform to the expected format (e.g., if N does not match the number of integers provided in the list).**
