The value of `N` is assigned from `raw_input()`, which accepts user input. However, the specific value of `N` is not provided in the initial state, so it remains as a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 1000.**
