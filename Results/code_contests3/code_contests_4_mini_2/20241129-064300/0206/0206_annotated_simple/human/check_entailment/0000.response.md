Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Here are the reasons why it does not meet the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is not valid in Python 3. It should use `input()` instead.

2. **Data Type Conversion**: The elements of the list `a` are read as strings from the input. The program does not convert these strings into integers before performing calculations. This will lead to incorrect behavior when trying to compute the maximum and minimum values.

3. **Calculation of Distance**: The program computes the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `a` using `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`. However, since `a` is not converted to integers, this computation will not yield the correct numerical values. 

4. **Minimum Distance Requirement**: The problem requires the minimum distance to be traveled when starting and ending at any position. The correct interpretation is that AtCoDeer can travel from the leftmost house to the rightmost house and back, which means the total distance traveled is indeed equal to the distance between the farthest houses. The program does not handle this appropriately because of the incorrect data type and the use of `np` functions without proper context (assuming `np` refers to the NumPy library, which is not imported in the program).

5. **Output Requirement**: The problem specifically requires the output to be printed in a certain format, which is not guaranteed due to the potential errors in the logic and input handling.

Given these points, the program fails to accurately implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated in the description.
