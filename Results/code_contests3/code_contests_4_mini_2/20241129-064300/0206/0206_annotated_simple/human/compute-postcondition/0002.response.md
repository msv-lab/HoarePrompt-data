In the given code, `ans` is assigned the value of `np.abs(np.max(a) - np.min(a))`. This means we are calculating the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the list `a`. The values of `N` and `a` will determine the outcome.

1. `np.max(a)` finds the maximum value in the list `a`.
2. `np.min(a)` finds the minimum value in the list `a`.
3. The difference between these two values is taken.
4. `np.abs()` ensures that the result is non-negative.

Since `N` is an integer and `a` is a list of strings, it is assumed that the strings can be compared to determine the max and min values. However, the specific values of `a` are not known, which prevents us from calculating the exact value of `ans`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `ans` is calculated based on the max and min of the list `a`, which is unknown in this context.

Output State: **`N` is an integer value as input from the user; `a` is a list of strings from the user input; `ans` is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of `a`.**
