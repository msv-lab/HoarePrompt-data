The variable `N` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts user input as a string. However, since `N` is described as an integer in the initial state, this indicates that `raw_input()` would typically be expected to return a string representation of an integer. The rest of the variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer value as input from the user, and `a` remains a list of N integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Output State: **`N` is an integer value as input from the user; `a` is a list of N integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.**
