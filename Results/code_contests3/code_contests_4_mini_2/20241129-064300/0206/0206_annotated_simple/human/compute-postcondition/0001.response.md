`a` is assigned the value of `raw_input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on whitespace. Since `N` is an integer value representing the number of integers and `a` is expected to hold `N` integers, the output state indicates that `a` will now be a list of strings from the user input. The values of `N` and the integers within the list will not change, but `a` will now contain the input as strings. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer value as input from the user; `a` is a list of strings from the user input.**
