Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the input correctly because it uses `raw_input()` and `np.abs()` without properly importing `numpy`. Additionally, the program incorrectly interprets the problem statement. The minimum distance to be traveled is not simply the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum coordinates. Instead, AtCoDeer can start and end at any positions, meaning that he needs to cover all houses, which requires calculating the distance from the leftmost to the rightmost house.

For example, with the input `4` followed by the coordinates `2 3 7 9`, the correct minimum distance should be `9 - 2 = 7`. However, if the house coordinates were `0 1000`, the program would output `1000 - 0 = 1000`, which is indeed correct for that specific case. 

Yet, if the input were `1`, with the coordinates `5`, then the output would incorrectly indicate a distance of `0`, as the maximum and minimum are the same point, but AtCoDeer must still travel to that house. 

Moreover, the program does not correctly account for the case of multiple houses with the same coordinates, which would also lead to incorrect outputs. 

Thus, the logic is fundamentally flawed, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
