The variable `a` is assigned the value resulting from `raw_input().split()`, which takes an input string, splits it into separate components based on whitespace, and assigns the resulting list of strings to `a`. The previous value of `a` is not explicitly defined, but it will now represent the split input. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100, and `a` is now a list of strings obtained from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
