#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True because an empty string is equal to its reverse, confirming that it is a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, and returns `True` if it is a palindrome or `False` if it is not. If `n` contains only digits, it will return `True` as the filtered string will be empty.
