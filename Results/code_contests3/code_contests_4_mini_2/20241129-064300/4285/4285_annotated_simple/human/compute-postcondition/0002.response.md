The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{10000000}\). After executing the function body, it returns `True` because an empty string is equal to its reverse, confirming that it is a palindrome. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` indicating that the input meets the criteria of being a palindrome. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns `True` indicating that the input meets the criteria of being a palindrome.**
