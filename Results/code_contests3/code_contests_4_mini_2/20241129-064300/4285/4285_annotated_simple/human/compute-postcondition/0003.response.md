The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, specifically a string representation of a large integer, and processes it by filtering out non-alphabetic characters and converting the remaining characters to lowercase. It then checks if the resulting string is equal to its reverse, which is a common method to determine if a string is a palindrome. 

However, the annotations incorrectly suggest that the function returns `True` when confirming `n` is a palindrome based on the original integer value. Since `n` is a positive integer, the function will always return `False` unless `n` is an empty string or contains only alphabetic characters that form a palindrome when filtered and lowercased. 

Thus, if `n` contains only digits, it will lead to an empty string being checked against its reverse, resulting in `True`. 

The potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is a positive integer containing no alphabetic characters, it will return `True` because the filtered string will be empty.
- If `n` contains alphabetic characters, it will return `True` only if those characters themselves form a palindrome when lowercased.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string representation of a positive integer `n`, filters out non-alphabetic characters, checks if the resulting string is a palindrome, and returns `True` if it is a palindrome or `False` if it is not. If `n` contains only digits, it will return `True` as the filtered string will be empty. **
