Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

1. **Problem Description Requirements**: The goal is to determine the n-th even-length positive palindrome number based on the input integer `n`. This requires generating or retrieving a specific sequence of numbers that are palindromes with an even number of digits.

2. **Program Logic**: The annotated program attempts to check if a given string (assumed to be `n`) is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and then comparing the result with its reverse. This does not relate to generating or identifying even-length palindrome numbers, nor does it take into account the integer nature of `n` or the requirement to output a specific n-th even-length palindrome.

3. **Input Handling**: The function does not handle `n` as an integer, nor does it process it to compute the n-th even-length palindrome. Instead, it treats `n` as a string and checks for palindromic properties, which is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

4. **Output Requirement**: The program does not produce any output related to the n-th even-length palindrome number, which is a key requirement of the task.

In summary, the program does not implement the functionality required to solve the problem as described, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
