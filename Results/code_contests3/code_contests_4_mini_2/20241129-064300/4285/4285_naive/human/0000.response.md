Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input `n` and attempts to check if it is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and reversing the string. 

However, the problem requires the function to return the n-th even-length positive palindrome number, which is not addressed by the code. For instance, if `n = 1`, the expected output is `11`, but the function does not even compute this value. Instead, it focuses on palindrome checking and does not generate even-length palindromes at all.

An input case such as `n = 1` should return `11`, but the function does not implement the logic to generate or return such a number. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
