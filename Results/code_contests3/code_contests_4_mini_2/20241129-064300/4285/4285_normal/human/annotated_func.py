#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string x, which is composed of the lowercase alphabetic characters extracted from the positive integer n, is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, extracts all alphabetic characters from it, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome. The function returns True if `x` is a palindrome, and False otherwise. However, since `n` is a positive integer, it will not contain any alphabetic characters by definition, resulting in `x` always being an empty string. Therefore, the function will always return True, as an empty string is considered a palindrome.
