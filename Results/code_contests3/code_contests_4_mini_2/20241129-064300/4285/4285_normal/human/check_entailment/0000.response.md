The provided program is intended to determine the n-th even-length palindrome number based on the given problem description. However, the code does not implement the required functionality. Instead, it defines a function (`func_1`) that processes a positive integer `n`, extracts alphabetic characters, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string is a palindrome. This is irrelevant to the task of generating the n-th even-length palindrome number.

The output hints clarify that since `n` is a positive integer, it will not contain any alphabetic characters, meaning that `x` will always be an empty string. Consequently, the function will always return True, indicating that the code does not perform any meaningful checks or calculations related to even-length palindromes.

The problems with the code can be summarized as follows:
1. The function does not compute the n-th even-length palindrome number as required.
2. The logic is completely unrelated to the task described, making it ineffective for the purpose.

Given that the code does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and consistently returns True for any positive integer input, it is clear that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
