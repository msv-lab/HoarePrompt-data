The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000. After executing the function body, it checks if the string `x`, which is composed of the lowercase alphabetic characters extracted from the positive integer `n`, is a palindrome. If `x` is a palindrome, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` if the extracted string `x` is a palindrome, and `False` if it is not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns True if the extracted string x from n is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns False.**
