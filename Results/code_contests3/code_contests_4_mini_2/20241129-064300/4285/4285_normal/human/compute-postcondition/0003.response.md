Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n`, extracts all alphabetic characters from it, converts them to lowercase, and checks if the resulting string `x` is a palindrome. The function returns True if `x` is a palindrome, and False otherwise. However, since `n` is a positive integer, it will not contain any alphabetic characters by definition, resulting in `x` always being an empty string. Therefore, the function will always return True, as an empty string is considered a palindrome. **
