Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input `n`, but it does not handle the task of generating the n-th even-length palindrome number. Instead, it appears to check if a given string is a palindrome by filtering out alphabetic characters and comparing it to its reverse. This is entirely unrelated to the problem of finding even-length palindrome numbers.

For instance, if we input `1`, the expected output should be `11`, but the function does not produce this result at all. In fact, it does not even return a palindrome number, as it is not designed to compute them.

Thus, since the function does not address the problem as specified, it is incorrect.
