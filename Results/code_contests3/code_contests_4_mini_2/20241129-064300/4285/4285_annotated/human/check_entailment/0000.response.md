Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. The problem specifically asks for a function to determine the n-th even-length palindrome number based on a given positive integer `n`, while the annotated program instead processes a string input to check for palindromic properties of alphabetic characters.

Here are the key points that demonstrate the program's incorrectness:

1. **Input Type and Purpose**: The function `func_1` expects a string input, but the problem description specifies that the input should be a single integer `n`. The function does not handle integers, thus failing to meet the input requirements.

2. **Functionality**: The function is designed to check if a string (after filtering for alphabetic characters) is a palindrome. However, the problem requires generating the n-th even-length palindrome number, which involves constructing specific numeric values rather than checking for palindromic properties in a string.

3. **Output**: The expected output of the function should be an even-length palindrome number corresponding to the input integer `n`. The provided function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on whether a string is a palindrome, which does not align with the required output of an even-length palindrome number.

4. **Example Cases**: The examples provided in the problem description (e.g., input `1` should yield `11`, input `10` should yield `1001`) cannot be satisfied by the current implementation of the function.

In summary, the function does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description; therefore, it is incorrect.
