The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{1000000}\). After executing the function body, the program returns `True` since the empty string 'x' is equal to its reverse 'x[::-1]'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return `True` based on the condition that the empty string is equal to its reverse.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns True.**
