#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^1000000.
def func_1(n):
    x = ''.join([x.lower() for x in n if x.isalpha()])
    return x == x[::-1]
    #The program returns True since the empty string 'x' is equal to its reverse 'x[::-1]'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `n`, extracts alphabetic characters from it, converts them to lowercase, and returns `True` if the resulting string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. If there are no alphabetic characters, it returns `True` since the empty string is considered a palindrome.
