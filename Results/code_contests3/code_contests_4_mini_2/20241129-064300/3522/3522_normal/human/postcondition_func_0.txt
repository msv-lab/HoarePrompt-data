The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries, and for each query, it processes a positive integer `a`. If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and sets a counter `c` to 1. Then, it checks if the modified `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}; if it is, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it computes and outputs `(a / 4) + c`. The function does not return any values; instead, it prints results directly for each query.
