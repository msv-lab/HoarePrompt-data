Given the initial state where `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, and `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, along with the conditions for `a` and `c`, we analyze the output of the provided code snippet.

1. If `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, there are no changes to `a` or `c`.
2. The output of the print statement depends on whether `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If `a` is in that set, it prints -1; otherwise, it computes `a / 4 + c`.

To determine the final output state, we need to consider the possible values of `a` based on the conditions above. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input; if `a` is odd, `a` is decreased by 9 and `c` is set to 1; if `a` is even, there are no changes to `a` or `c`. The output is -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.**
