According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`, which represents the number of queries. Since `q` is a positive integer, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `q-1` for each iteration. 

Since `q` is already given as a positive integer before the loop starts, we can assume it has been set to a valid value within the specified range (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5). 

For the loop to execute the first time, the value of `_` will be 0, and `ni` will correspond to the first positive integer input line which is also guaranteed to be a positive integer (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9).

State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), for the loop to execute the first time `_` is 0, and `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input.**
