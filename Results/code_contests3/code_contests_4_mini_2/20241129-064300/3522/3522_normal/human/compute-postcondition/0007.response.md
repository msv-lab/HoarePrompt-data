To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. **Understanding the initial state**:
   - `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5).
   - `_` is 0.
   - `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input.
   - `a` is an input string.

2. **Evaluating the conditions**:
   - The condition checks if `a` is in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). 
   - If `a` is one of these values, it prints `-1`.
   - If `a` is not in that tuple, it calculates `a / 4 + c`.

3. **Determining the value of `c`**:
   - `c` is set to 1 if `a` is odd after subtracting 9; otherwise, `c` remains 0.

Based on these evaluations and calculations, we find that the output state depends on the specific values of `a` and its relation to the conditions provided.

However, since the specific value of `a` is not provided, we can't determine the exact outcome of the print statement. Instead, we can conclude the possible scenarios depending on the value of `a`.

Therefore, the output state can be generalized as follows:

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 0, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on `a`, and the output will be -1 if `a` is in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), otherwise it will be `a / 4 + c`.**
