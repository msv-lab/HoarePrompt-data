`c` is assigned the value `0`, but the previous values of the affected variables are not changed. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5); `_` is 0; `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0**
