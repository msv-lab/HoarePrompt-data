According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of iterations specified by the input. The loop is controlled by the `xrange(input())`, which means it will iterate as many times as the value of `input()`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, indicating that this was the second iteration (since `_` starts from 0). 

For the loop to execute one more time, the input must be at least 3, allowing for a third iteration. The value of `_` will be incremented by 1, resulting in `_` being 2 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `a` is either odd or even, resulting in either -1 or a calculation of `a / 4 + c`, for the loop to execute a third time `input()` must be at least 3.**
