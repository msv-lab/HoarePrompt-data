The value of `c` is initialized to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `a` is the input value (which can be either odd or even), `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `a` is the input value (which can be either odd or even), `c` is 0**
