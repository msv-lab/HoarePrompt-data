To determine the output state, we first analyze the variables based on the provided initial state and code snippet.

1. **Initial Variables:**
   - `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input.
   - `a` is either odd or even, affecting the values of `c` and `a`.

2. **Code Logic:**
   - If `a` is odd, then `c` is set to 1 and `a` is reduced by 9.
   - If `a` is even, `c` remains 0, and `a` stays unchanged.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The output of the print statement evaluates to -1 if `a` is in the set (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11).
   - Otherwise, it calculates `a / 4 + c`.

4. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If `a` is odd (and thus modified), we need to check if the modified value of `a` is in the specified set.
   - If `a` is even (and unchanged), we check its value directly against the set.

Given that we do not have specific values for `a` or `ni`, we can only describe the output state in terms of these conditions.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 1, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `a` is either odd or even, resulting in either -1 or a calculation of `a / 4 + c`.**
