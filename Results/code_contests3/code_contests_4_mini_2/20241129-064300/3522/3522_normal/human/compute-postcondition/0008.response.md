According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of iterations specified by `input()`. The loop will execute for a total of `q` times, and since `_` is currently 0, it indicates that we are at the start of the first iteration. At the end of the last iteration (which is the current iteration), `_` will increment by 1 for the next iteration.

At present, `_` is 0, which means this is the first iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented to 1. Since the input will dictate the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `input()` returns at least 2, allowing for a second execution of the loop.

State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 1, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on `a`, for the loop to execute a second time the input must be at least 2.**
