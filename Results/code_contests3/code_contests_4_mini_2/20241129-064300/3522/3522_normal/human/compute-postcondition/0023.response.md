The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it processes a number of queries, `q`, which is a positive integer indicating how many queries will be provided. Each query consists of a positive integer `ni`. The function will handle `q` such queries, where each `ni` is also a positive integer. 

Based on the output, the function will perform operations based on the values of `ni`. However, the specific return values for each query are not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of queries `q`, which is a positive integer, and processes each query represented by a positive integer `ni`. The specific output or return values based on `ni` are not specified.**
