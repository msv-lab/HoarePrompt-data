`c` is assigned the value `1`. The previous value of `c` was `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `a` is `a - 9`, and `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is 2, `ni` is the first positive integer provided in the input, `a` is `a - 9`, `c` is 1**
