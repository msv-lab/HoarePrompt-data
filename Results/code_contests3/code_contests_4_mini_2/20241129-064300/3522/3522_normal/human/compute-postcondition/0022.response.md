After analyzing the loop code and the initial state, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing can be determined as follows:

The loop processes `q` queries, where `a` is derived from each input `ni`. For each query, `c` is either 0 or 1 based on whether `a` is odd. The output will be either -1 if `a` is one of the specified values (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) or `a / 4 + c` otherwise.

After all iterations of the loop:
- `q` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), indicating the number of queries processed.
- `_` will be `q - 1`, representing the last iteration index.
- Each `ni` corresponds to the positive integers provided as input.
- Each `a` is derived from its corresponding `ni` and will vary per iteration.
- `c` will be 0 or 1 based on whether the final value of `a` in each iteration was odd or even.
- The final output for each query will be either -1 or the computed value based on `a`.

Therefore, the overall output state after all iterations of the loop is:

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5), `_` is `q - 1`, `ni` are the positive integers provided in the input, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last processed `a`, and the outputs are either -1 or the calculated values based on `a` for each query.**
