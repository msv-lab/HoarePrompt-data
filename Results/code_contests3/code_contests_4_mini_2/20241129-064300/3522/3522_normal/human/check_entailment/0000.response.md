Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. For each query, a single positive integer `n_i` is given.
2. The goal is to represent `n_i` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands.
3. If it's not possible to represent `n_i` in such a way, the program should return -1.
4. A composite number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that is not prime.

### Program Analysis:
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

- The program reads the number of queries and processes each integer `a`.
- If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments the counter `c` by 1.
- It checks if the modified `a` is within the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} (which are all numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of composite numbers).
- If `a` is in that set, it outputs -1; otherwise, it computes `(a / 4) + c` and prints that value.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that:
- If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 and sets `c` to 1.
- It checks if `a` (after possible modification) is in {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} and prints -1 if it is.
- Otherwise, it outputs `(a / 4) + c`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Odd numbers less than 9**: For any odd number `n_i` less than 9, the program will subtract 9, resulting in a negative number or zero. The check against {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11} will then not handle these correctly.
   - For example, if `n_i = 1`, it will result in `a = 1 - 9 = -8`, and it would incorrectly go to the else clause and evaluate `-8 / 4 + c` which is not valid.
  
2. **Even numbers less than 4**: The program does not correctly handle even numbers less than 4.
   - For example, if `n_i = 2`, it checks if `2` is in the set, which it is, and thus returns -1, which is correct. But it does not handle larger even numbers correctly when they are not composite sums.

3. **Numbers like 5, 7, 11**: The program correctly identifies these and returns -1, but it does not handle other larger odd composites correctly.

4. **Division by 4**: The expression `a / 4` will not work as intended because it will perform integer division in Python 2 (`print a // 4 + c` is what we would expect for the correct output).

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for certain edge cases, particularly those involving odd numbers less than 9 and even numbers less than 4. Additionally, the handling of division and the potential for negative values is not robust.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**.
