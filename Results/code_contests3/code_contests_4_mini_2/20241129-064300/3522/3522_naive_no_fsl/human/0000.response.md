To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to represent a given positive integer `ni` as a sum of the maximum possible number of composite summands and return this maximum count or -1 if no such summands exist. 

**Composite Numbers**: A composite number is greater than 1 and has divisors other than 1 and itself. The smallest composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, etc.

### Input and Output Requirements
- Input:
  - The first line contains an integer `q`, representing the number of queries.
  - The following `q` lines each contain a positive integer `ni`.
  
- Output:
  - For each query, print the maximum possible number of composite summands or -1 if no such representation exists.

### Code Analysis
```python
for _ in xrange(input()):
    a = input()
    c = 0
    if a % 2 != 0:
        a = a - 9
        c = 1
    print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. **Odd Numbers Handling**: 
   - If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 and increments `c` by 1. This is an attempt to make the number even so that it can be represented with composite numbers, as all composite summands (like 4, 6, 8) are even.

2. **Invalid Cases**:
   - The program checks if the adjusted value `a` is in the set of small integers `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`. If `a` falls into this set, it prints `-1`, indicating that it cannot be represented as a sum of composite numbers.

3. **Calculating Composite Summands**:
   - For values of `a` that are not in the invalid set, it calculates the number of composite summands as `a / 4 + c`, where `c` is the adjustment made if `a` was originally odd.

### Edge Cases and Issues
Let's consider some specific edge cases:

1. **Case for `ni = 1`**: 
   - The output is -1, which is correct since 1 cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.
   
2. **Case for `ni = 2`**:
   - The output is -1, which is correct for the same reason as above.
   
3. **Case for `ni = 3`**:
   - The output is -1, which is again correct.

4. **Case for `ni = 6`**:
   - The output should be `1` (since 6 can be represented as 6 alone). The program outputs `1`, which is correct.

5. **Case for `ni = 7`**:
   - The output is -1, which is correct since 7 cannot be expressed as a sum of composite numbers.

6. **Case for `ni = 8`**:
   - The output should be `2` (as it can be represented as 4 + 4). The program outputs `2`, which is correct.

7. **Invalid Logic for Larger Composites**:
   - If we take a larger composite number that is not handled properly, such as `ni = 10`, the program will give `1` (10 / 4 = 2 + 0 = 2), but it should correctly account for the representation as `10 = 4 + 6`, which can also yield a summand count of `2`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the program against various cases, we can see that it handles some cases correctly but fails to account for all potential splits. It particularly fails for higher composite numbers (like `10`), as it does not verify the representation properly and counts incorrectly. 

Thus, we conclude that the code does not meet the requirements of the problem specification for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
