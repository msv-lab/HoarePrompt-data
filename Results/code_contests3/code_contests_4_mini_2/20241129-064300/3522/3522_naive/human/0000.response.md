To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The program is structured to handle multiple queries to determine how many composite summands can represent each given integer \( n_i \). 

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple integers, which is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Logic**:
   - For odd integers \( n_i \), it reduces \( n_i \) by 9 (if applicable) and increments the count of summands \( c \) by 1.
   - It then checks if the adjusted \( n_i \) is one of the integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of composite numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, it returns -1.
   - If not, it computes the maximum number of composite summands as \( a / 4 + c \).

### Potential Issues:
- The code does not explicitly handle cases where \( n_i \) is less than 4. According to the problem description, any integer less than 4 should return -1 since there are no composite numbers below 4.
- The check for odd integers and subtracting 9 may lead to improper results for small odd numbers (for example, \( n_i = 5 \) becomes -4 which is not handled correctly).
- The integer division is performed with `/`, which in Python 2.x results in integer division, but in Python 3.x would result in a float. Without knowing the exact version of Python intended for this code, there may be ambiguity in how the division is handled.

### Edge Cases:
- For \( n_i = 1 \): Should return -1, and the program correctly does so.
- For \( n_i = 2 \): Should return -1, and the program correctly does so.
- For \( n_i = 3 \): Should return -1, and the program correctly does so.
- For \( n_i = 5 \): The program would subtract 9, resulting in -4, which is not handled correctly. It should return -1, but the program does not account for this case and produces a faulty output.

### Conclusion:
Given that there is at least one case (e.g., \( n_i = 5 \)) where the program does not work as expected, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
