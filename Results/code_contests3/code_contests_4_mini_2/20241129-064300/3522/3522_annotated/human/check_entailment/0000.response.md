Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Handling of Odd Numbers**: The program subtracts 9 from odd numbers (`a = a - 9`) and sets a flag `c = 1`. While this adjustment might be intended to make the number even (since composite numbers greater than 1 are even), it doesn't address how to handle odd numbers effectively. For example, if `n = 1`, the program immediately tries to print `-1`, which is correct, but it does not adequately account for all odd numbers and their possible composite representations.

2. **Composite Number Check**: The program uses a hardcoded set of values `{1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}` to check against the modified input. This is insufficient because it does not account for all composite numbers and the various possibilities of summing to form composites. For instance, it fails to recognize that while `6` can be split into `4 + 2`, it can also be represented as `3 + 3`, which is not valid since `3` is not composite.

3. **Output Calculation**: The calculation for the maximum number of summands is flawed. It assumes that the number of summands for an even number can simply be calculated as `a / 4 + c`. However, this formula does not consider the distribution of composite numbers properly. For example, for `n = 10`, the expected maximum summands would be `2` (as `4 + 4 + 2`), but the formula would yield `2 + 0 = 2`, which is correct here, but the logic does not generalize well to other cases.

4. **Lack of Comprehensive Logic**: The program does not have comprehensive logic to handle the entirety of the problem space described in the prompt. It lacks checks for various ranges and does not adequately derive the maximum composite summands for larger numbers.

Overall, while the program manages to return correct outputs for some specific cases, it does not adhere to the logic and structure required by the problem statement universally, making it incorrect.
