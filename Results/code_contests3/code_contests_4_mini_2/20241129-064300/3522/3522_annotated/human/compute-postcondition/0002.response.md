The variable `c` is initialized to 0, which means its previous value is now set to 0. The values of the other variables (`q` and `a`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0**
