To derive the output state, we need to analyze the provided Python code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `q` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5`.
   - `a` is an input string that represents an odd integer minus 9.
   - `c` is set to 1 if `a` is odd; otherwise, `c` remains 0.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The expression `print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c` checks if `a` is among the set of values `(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)`.
   - Since `a` is represented as an input string, we need to convert it to an integer to properly check its membership in the tuple.
   - If `a` is one of those values, the output will be `-1`.
   - If `a` is not one of those values, the output will be calculated as `a / 4 + c`.

3. **Calculating `c`**:
   - Since `a` is an odd integer minus 9, `a` must be odd. Therefore, `c` is determined to be 1.

Given that `a` is an odd integer minus 9, let's assume `a` can take various values based on the input string provided. 

Thus, we can summarize the output states based on the possible values for `a`:

- If `a` is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11, the output state would indicate that the result is `-1`.
- If `a` is not one of these values, we will compute `a / 4 + 1`.

Since `a` is not a fixed value but rather an input string representing a range of integers, we cannot provide a single output without knowing the specific input string value for `a`. 

Thus, the output state would be contingent upon the specific value of `a`. However, we know that `c` is consistently 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string that represents an odd integer minus 9; `c` is 1.**
