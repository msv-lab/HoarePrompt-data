To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: `q` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string. If `a` is odd (i.e., `a % 2 != 0`), then `c` is set to 1. If `a` is even, `c` remains 0.

The code snippet:
```
print - 1 if a in (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) else a / 4 + c
```

1. The code checks if the value of `a` is in the tuple (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11). If it is, the output will be -1.
2. If `a` is not in that tuple, it will calculate `a / 4 + c`. Here `c` would be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `a` is even or odd.

Since `a` is specified as an input string, we will assume `a` is an integer based on the context provided.

Now, we can summarize the possible outcomes based on the value of `a`:

- If `a` is one of (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11), the output will be -1.
- If `a` is not one of those values, we will calculate `a / 4 + c`, where `c` will be 1 if `a` is odd and 0 if `a` is even.

Thus, the output state depends on the value of `a`, which is an input string and can take various integer values. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input integer; `c` is either 0 or 1; output is either -1 or `a / 4 + c`.**
