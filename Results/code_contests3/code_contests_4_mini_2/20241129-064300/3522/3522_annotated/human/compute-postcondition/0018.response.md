The operation `a = a - 9` attempts to subtract 9 from the string `a`. Since this operation is not valid for a string, it will result in an error. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0 and the operation results in an error.**
