The value of `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `c` was `2`, but now it is updated to `0`. The variables `q` and `a` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an input string representing an odd integer minus 9, `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an input string representing an odd integer minus 9, `c` is 0**
