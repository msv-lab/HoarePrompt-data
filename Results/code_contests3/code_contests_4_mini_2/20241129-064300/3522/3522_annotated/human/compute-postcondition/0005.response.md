The value of `c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, and the other variables (`q` and `a`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an odd integer minus 9, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an odd integer minus 9, `c` is 1**
