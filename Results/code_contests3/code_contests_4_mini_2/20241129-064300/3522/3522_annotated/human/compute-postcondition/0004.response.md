The value of `a` is assigned the value `a - 9`. The value of `a` is an odd integer, and since it is positive, subtracting 9 from it will still yield a valid integer. However, the specific resulting value of `a` is not determined from the initial state; it will be an integer that is 9 less than the original odd integer value of `a`. The values of `q` and `c` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an odd integer minus 9, and `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is an odd integer minus 9, and `c` is 0.**
