The function accepts a series of positive integers and for each integer, it checks if it is odd. If it is odd, it subtracts 9 from it and sets a flag `c` to 1. The function then prints -1 if the resulting integer is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}; otherwise, it prints the result of integer division of the integer by 4, adjusted by `c`. The function processes multiple integers based on user input, but it does not return any values directly.
