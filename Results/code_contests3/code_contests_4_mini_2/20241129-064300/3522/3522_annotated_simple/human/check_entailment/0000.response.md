The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem of representing a positive integer `ni` as a sum of maximum possible composite summands. 

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `q`, the number of queries, and then processes `q` integers, which represent the values of `ni`.

2. **Logic**:
   - For each integer `a` (which is `ni`):
     - If `a` is odd, it subtracts 9 from `a` and increments a counter `c` by 1. This adjustment is made because odd numbers cannot be represented by even composite summands.
     - It then checks if the adjusted value of `a` is in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If it is, the output is -1, meaning no valid composite summands can be formed.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of composite summands by dividing `a` by 4 and adding `c` (which accounts for the initial adjustment if `a` was odd).

3. **Composite Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies that the smallest composite number is 4. Therefore, for numbers less than 4, it returns -1, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The logic for even numbers is straightforward: any even number greater than or equal to 4 can be expressed as sums of 4s.

### Issues:
- **Handling of Odd Numbers**: 
  - If `a` is odd and less than 9, subtracting 9 will yield a negative number, which is not handled properly in the composite check. For example, if `a` is 5, after subtracting 9, it becomes -4, which is not in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}, leading to incorrect processing.
  - The query for `a = 1`, `a = 2`, or `a = 3` directly returns -1, which is correct. However, for odd numbers greater than or equal to 9, the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly in cases like `a = 15` or `a = 21`, where additional checks are needed to ensure the remaining value after adjustments can still be split into valid composite numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for all cases, particularly with odd integers greater than or equal to 9. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
