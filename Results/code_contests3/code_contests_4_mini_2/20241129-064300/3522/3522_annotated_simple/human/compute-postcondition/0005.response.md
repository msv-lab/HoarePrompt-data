The variable `c` is assigned the value 1. The previous value of `c` was 0, and this is the only variable affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a string representation of a positive odd integer, `c` is 1.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5, `a` is a string representation of a positive odd integer, `c` is 1**
