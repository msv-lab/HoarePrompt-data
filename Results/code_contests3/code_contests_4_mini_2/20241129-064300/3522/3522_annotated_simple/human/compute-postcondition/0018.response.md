The operation `a = a - 9` attempts to subtract 9 from the string `a`, which is not a valid operation in Python. Therefore, this would raise a TypeError, and no changes would occur to the variables. 

The output state must reflect that no changes were made due to the invalid operation. 

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5 - 1; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0 and the operation is invalid due to a TypeError.**
