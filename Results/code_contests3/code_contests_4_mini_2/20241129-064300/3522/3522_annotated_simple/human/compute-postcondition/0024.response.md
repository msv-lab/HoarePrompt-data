Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `q` representing the number of queries, where each query consists of a positive integer `a`. For each query, if `a` is odd, it is decreased by 9, and a counter `c` is set to 1. The function then checks if the resulting value of `a` (after potentially being adjusted) is one of the numbers in the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11}. If it is, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the integer division of `a` by 4 plus the counter `c`. The function will process `q` queries and print the results for each. Edge cases include handling of odd numbers less than or equal to 9, which will result in returning -1, as well as ensuring proper output formatting.**
