The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on a positive integer `q` such that \(1 \leq q \leq 10^5\), which represents the number of queries. For each query, there is a positive integer `ni` such that \(1 \leq ni \leq 10^9\). The output of the function is determined based on the processing of these queries, although the specific outputs are not provided in the constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process `q` queries with each query being a positive integer `ni`, and it will return results based on the evaluations of these queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries, and for each query ni (1 ≤ ni ≤ 10^9), it processes and returns results based on these queries.**
