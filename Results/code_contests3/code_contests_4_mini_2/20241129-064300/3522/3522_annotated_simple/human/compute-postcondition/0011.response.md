The operation `a = a - 9` attempts to subtract 9 from `a`, which is a string representation of a positive odd integer. Since mathematical operations cannot be directly performed on a string, this will lead to an error. Therefore, the values of the other variables `q` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5 - 1; `a` is a string representation of a positive odd integer; `c` is 0 and an error occurs due to invalid operation on string.**
