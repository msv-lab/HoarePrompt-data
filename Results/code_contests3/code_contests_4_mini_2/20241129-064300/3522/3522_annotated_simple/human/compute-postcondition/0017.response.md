The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are `q`, which remains unchanged as a positive integer, and `a`, which is an input string. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5 - 1; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5 - 1; `a` is an input string; `c` is 0**.
