The value of `c` is initialized to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a string representation of a positive integer (at least 1); `c` is 0.

Output State: **`q` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 10^5; `a` is a string representation of a positive integer (at least 1); `c` is 0**
