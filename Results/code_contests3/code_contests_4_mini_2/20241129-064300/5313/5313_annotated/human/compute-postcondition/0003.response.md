Given the initial state where \( N \) is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^6 \), \( n \) is an input integer, \( x \) is the integer part of the square root of \( n \), and \( x^2 = n \):

1. The variable `answr` is assigned the value of \( x \times 4 \).
2. Since \( x \) is the integer part of the square root of \( n \), we know that \( n \) is a perfect square (as \( x^2 = n \)).
3. Therefore, \( x = \sqrt{n} \).
4. The value of `answr` becomes \( 4 \times x \).

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `x^2 = n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
