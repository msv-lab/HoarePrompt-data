To analyze the code snippet provided:

1. The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`.
2. The variable `x` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `n`.
3. The initial state indicates that `N` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\), and `n` is an input integer. The constraint states that \(x^2 \neq n\) and \(x \times (x + 1) \leq n\).

From this information, we know `x` can be calculated based on `n`. However, without a specific value for `n`, we won't know the exact value of `x` or subsequently `answr`.

Given these constraints, the output can only provide a relationship based on the value of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is 4 * (x + 1)**
