Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x^2 = n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * x`. If `x^2` is not equal to `n`, and if `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, then `answr` is `4x + 2`; otherwise, `answr` is `4 * (x + 1)`.***
