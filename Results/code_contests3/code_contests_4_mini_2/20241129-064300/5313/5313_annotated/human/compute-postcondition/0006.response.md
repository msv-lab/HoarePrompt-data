The variable `answr` is assigned the value `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Given that `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`, the expression simplifies as follows: 

1. `x + x + 1` simplifies to `2x + 1`.
2. Therefore, `answr` becomes `(2x + 1) * 2` which simplifies further to `4x + 2`.

Since `x` is a defined variable based on the conditions provided, the output state reflects the relationship between `n`, `x`, and `answr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n` where `x` squared is not equal to `n`; `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`; `answr` is `4x + 2`.**
