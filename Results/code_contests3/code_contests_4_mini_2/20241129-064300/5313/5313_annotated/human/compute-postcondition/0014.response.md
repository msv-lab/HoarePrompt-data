Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and calculates a value `answr` based on whether `n` is a perfect square or not. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`, where `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square and `x * (x + 1)` is greater than `n`, it returns `4 * x + 2`; otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The function does not return a value but instead prints the computed result. **
