To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze if the program correctly calculates the minimum perimeter for a given area of N city blocks.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads a single integer N from the input, which adheres to the constraints \(1 \leq N \leq 10^6\).

2. **Square Root Calculation**:
   - The variable `x` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of N (`x = int(n ** 0.5)`). This is correct as it helps to determine the possible dimensions of a square or rectangle that can enclose the area.

3. **Perfect Square Check**:
   - If N is a perfect square (\(x^2 = n\)), it calculates the perimeter as \(4 * x\). This is accurate for a square, since the perimeter of a square with side length \(x\) is indeed \(4x\).

4. **Non-Perfect Square Handling**:
   - If N is not a perfect square, the program checks whether \(x * (x + 1) > n\). This condition is meant to determine if using dimensions \(x\) and \(x + 1\) is sufficient to enclose the area.
   - If this condition is true, it sets the perimeter to \(4x + 2\). This calculation reflects a rectangle with one dimension being \(x\) and the other being \(x + 1\), where the extra 2 accounts for the additional perimeter needed due to the uneven dimensions.
   - Otherwise, it sets the perimeter to \(4 * (x + 1)\). This would correspond to a rectangle that has dimensions of \(x + 1\) by \(x + 1\), effectively enclosing at least N blocks.

### Verification Against the Problem Description:

- The output of the function is the minimum perimeter achievable for any configuration that encloses exactly N blocks.
- For perfect squares, the calculation accurately provides the perimeter of the square.
- For non-perfect squares, the conditions and corresponding calculations ensure that the perimeter is minimized for other possible rectangular configurations.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine the minimum perimeter for enclosing N blocks. It covers both cases of perfect squares and non-perfect squares, adjusting the perimeter calculations accordingly. Therefore, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
