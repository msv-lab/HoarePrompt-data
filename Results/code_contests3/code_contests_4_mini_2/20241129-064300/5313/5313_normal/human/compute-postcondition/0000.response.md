The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `N` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^6. Therefore, `n` will take on a value that is also within this range. The output state reflects that `N` is still an integer within the specified range, and now `n` is equal to the input integer value. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer**.
