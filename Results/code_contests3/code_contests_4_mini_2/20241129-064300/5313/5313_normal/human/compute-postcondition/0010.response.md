Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `x ** 2 == n`, then `answr` is assigned the value `4 * x`. Otherwise, if `x * (x + 1) > n`, `answr` is calculated as (x + x + 1) * 2; otherwise, `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`.***
