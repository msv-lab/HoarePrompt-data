The variable `answr` is assigned the value `x * 4`. Given that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and `x` squared equals `n`, we can deduce that `answr` will equal `4 * x`. The value of `answr` will depend directly on the value of `x`, which is determined by `n`. Therefore, we will express the output state based on the known relationships.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
