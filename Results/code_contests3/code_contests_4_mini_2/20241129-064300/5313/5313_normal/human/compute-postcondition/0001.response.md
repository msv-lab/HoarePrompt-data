`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, which calculates the integer square root of `n`. The value of `N` is not directly affected, but `n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^6. Therefore, the value of `x` will depend on the specific value of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `x` will be a non-negative integer. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`.**
