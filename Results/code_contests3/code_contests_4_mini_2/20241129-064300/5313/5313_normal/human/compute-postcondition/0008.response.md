The variable `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`. The previous state indicates that `x` is the integer square root of `n` and satisfies `x * (x + 1) ≤ n`. Therefore, `answr` is calculated based on the current value of `x`. The value of `answr` will depend directly on the value of `x`, but the exact numeric value is not determined from the given information. Thus, the output state reflects the relationship and the new value assigned to `answr`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer square root of `n`; `answr` is assigned the value `4 * (x + 1)`**.
