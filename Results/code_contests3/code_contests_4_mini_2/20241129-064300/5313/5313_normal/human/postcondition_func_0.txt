The function accepts an integer input `n` (which must be a positive integer between 1 and 10^6) and calculates a value `answr` based on its integer square root. If `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * x`, where `x` is the integer square root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square and `x * (x + 1) > n`, it returns `(x + x + 1) * 2`. Otherwise, it returns `4 * (x + 1)`. The function prints the result to the console.
