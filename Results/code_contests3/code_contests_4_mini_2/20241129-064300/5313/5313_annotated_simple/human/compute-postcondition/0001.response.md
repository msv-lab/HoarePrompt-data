`x` is assigned the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`, where `n` is an input integer. The value of `x` will be the integer part of the square root of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.**
