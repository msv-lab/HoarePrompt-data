Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. If `x ** 2 == n`, then `answr` is equal to `4 * x`. If `x ** 2` is not equal to `n` and `x * (x + 1) > n`, then `answr` is calculated as `4x + 2`. Otherwise, `answr` is calculated as `4 * (x + 1).***
