Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a positive integer `n` from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^6. It calculates an integer value `answr` based on whether `n` is a perfect square or if `x * (x + 1)` exceeds `n`. It prints `answr`, which is calculated as follows: if `n` is a perfect square, it returns `4 * sqrt(n)`, otherwise it checks if `x * (x + 1) > n` and returns `2 * (x + x + 1)`, or `4 * (x + 1)` if not. The function does not return a value but prints the result instead. Additionally, if the input is out of range, the behavior is undefined since no validation is provided for the input value.**
