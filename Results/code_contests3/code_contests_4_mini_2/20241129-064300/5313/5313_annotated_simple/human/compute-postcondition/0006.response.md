To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `N` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq N \leq 10^6 \).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.
   - The product of `x` and `x + 1` is greater than `n`.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code snippet is: 
     ```
     answr = (x + x + 1) * 2
     ```
   - This translates to calculating `answr` using the value of `x`.

3. **Calculation**: 
   - The expression simplifies to:
     ```
     answr = (2x + 1) * 2 = 4x + 2
     ```

4. **Variables Affected**: 
   - The variable `answr` is assigned the value calculated from `x`.
   - The previous values of `N`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.

5. **Output State**: 
   - Since `x` is derived from `n` (specifically, \( x = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) \)) and `answr` is based on `x`, we can summarize the output state as follows.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is calculated as 4x + 2.**
