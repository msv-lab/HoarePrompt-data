In the given initial state, we know that `n` is a perfect square (since `x` squared equals `n`), and `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`. Therefore, `x` is a positive integer such that `x² = n`. 

The code snippet `answr = x * 4` assigns the value of `x` multiplied by 4 to the variable `answr`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and since `x` is derived from `n`, it is also a positive integer.

Thus, the output state will reflect `answr` as being equal to `4x`, where `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `N` ≤ 10^6; `n` is an input integer; `x` is the integer part of the square root of `n`; `answr` is equal to `4 * x`.**
