To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
The task requires finding the minimum perimeter of a region that encloses exactly N city blocks, where the layout is a square grid.

### Understanding the Program
1. The program calculates the integer square root of N, denoted as `x`.
2. It checks if `x` squared equals N. If true, it outputs `x * 4`, which represents the perimeter of a perfect square.
3. If `x * (x + 1) > n`, it computes the perimeter using `(x + x + 1) * 2`, which seems to be a way to handle rectangles that are slightly larger than a perfect square.
4. If neither of the above conditions are met, it defaults to `4 * (x + 1)`, which represents a perimeter for a minimally expanded shape beyond the perfect square.

### Evaluating Edge Cases
- For N = 1, the square perimeter is correctly calculated as 4.
- For N = 4, the square perimeter is correctly calculated as 8.
- For N = 11: 
  - `x` will be 3, and since `3 * (3 + 1) = 12` (which is greater than 11), it goes to the second condition. 
  - It computes the perimeter as `(3 + 3 + 1) * 2 = 14`, which is correct.
- For N = 22:
  - `x` will be 4, and since `4 * (4 + 1) = 20` (which is not greater than 22), it correctly goes to the third condition and computes `4 * (4 + 1) = 20`, which is correct.

### Potential Issues
The main logic to compute the perimeter for arbitrary N values based on the square root and the conditions set looks reasonable, but we need to ensure it works for all N values up to 1,000,000, particularly those that are not perfect squares.

#### A Test Case to Consider
Let's test N = 12:
- `x` will be 3.
- `3 * (3 + 1) = 12`, thus the second condition does not apply. It falls back to the third condition.
- The output will be `4 * (3 + 1) = 16`, which is incorrect since the minimum perimeter for 12 blocks is 16, but for a rectangular arrangement, it can also be achieved with an area of 3 by 4 (which gives a perimeter of 14).

### Conclusion
The provided program fails to correctly compute the minimum perimeter for certain values of N (specifically for composite numbers where the area can be arranged in different rectangular shapes).
