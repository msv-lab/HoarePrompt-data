The function accepts multiple integers from standard input, each representing a value `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999), and for each value, it counts and prints the number of prime numbers less than or equal to `n` using a sieve algorithm. The function does not return any values; it directly prints the results to the standard output for each input line. The function assumes valid input within specified constraints and does not handle cases where the input is outside this range.
