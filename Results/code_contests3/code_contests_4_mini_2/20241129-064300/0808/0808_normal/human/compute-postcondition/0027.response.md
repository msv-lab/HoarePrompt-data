After analyzing the loop code and the provided output states, we can deduce the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

The loop runs for `j` starting at `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8 for `i = 3`) and increments `j` by `i` (which is 3) until `j` reaches 1,000,000. The values of `j` will be 8, 11, 14, 17, and so on, setting the corresponding indices in the list `a` to `False`. 

The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches or exceeds 1,000,000, meaning it will mark several indices of the list `a` as `False`. Specifically, it will mark all indices `j` where `j` is of the form: 
- 8, 11, 14, 17, ..., until the maximum value of `j` is just less than 1,000,000.

Given that the loop will continue until the last `j` that is less than 1,000,000, we can determine that `a` will have a significant number of elements set to `False`, specifically those at indices formed by the arithmetic sequence starting from 8 with a common difference of 3.

After all iterations, `a` will still be a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` will remain 3, and `j` will be the last computed value just before it exceeds 1,000,000.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with several indices set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is the last value calculated in the loop that is less than 1,000,000.**
