The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is currently 17. This means that the 18th element of the list `a` (since indexing starts from 0) is changed from its initial value (which is not specified but assumed to be `True` or similar) to `False`. The values of `i` and other elements of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[17]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[17]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 17**.
