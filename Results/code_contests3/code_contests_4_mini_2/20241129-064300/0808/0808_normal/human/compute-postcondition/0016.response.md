According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 11. The loop's range is defined by `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`, which evaluates to `range(8, 1000000, 3)`. This means the loop starts at 8 and increments by 3 each iteration until it reaches 1,000,000.

The next value of `j` would be the current `j` (11) plus the step size `i` (3), which gives us `j = 11 + 3 = 14`. For the loop to execute another time, `j` must still be less than 1,000,000.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration must reflect that `j` is now 14.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; `a[11]` is set to `False`.**
