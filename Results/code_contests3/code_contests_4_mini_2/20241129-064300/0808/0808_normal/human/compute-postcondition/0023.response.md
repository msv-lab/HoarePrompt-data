According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and the range specified in the for loop. The loop iterates from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, `i ** 2 - 1` equals `3 ** 2 - 1`, which is `9 - 1 = 8`. So, the loop starts at 8 and increments by 3 each time.

Now, let's find the last value of `j` from the previous iteration. Since `j` starts at 8 and increments by 3, the values of `j` will be 8, 11, 14, ..., up to the maximum value less than 1,000,000. Given that the last value of `j` is 11, it means that the next value of `j` would be `11 + 3 = 14`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since the next value of `j` is 14, which is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can indeed execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 14 for the loop to execute a second time.**
