The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 14. This updates the 15th element of the list `a` to `False`. The values of the other variables `i` and the rest of the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 14, and `a[14]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 14, and `a[14]` is now `False**.
