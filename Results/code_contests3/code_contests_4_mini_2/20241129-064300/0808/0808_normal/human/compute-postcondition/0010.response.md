Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`. If `a[1]` is `True`, then the condition is satisfied for the first iteration of the loop, and the program proceeds with further logic. If `a[1]` is `False`, the loop will not execute further, but the state of `a` remains unchanged from its initial state.***
