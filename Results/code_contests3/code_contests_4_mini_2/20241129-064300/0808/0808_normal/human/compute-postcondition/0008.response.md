The value of `a[j]` is assigned `False`. Since `j` is 7, we are assigning `False` to the 7th index of the list `a`. The previous value of `a[7]` is not specified, but this action will change it to `False`. The other variables `i` and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[5]` set to `False` and `a[7]` now set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 7.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[5]` set to `False` and `a[7]` now set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**.
