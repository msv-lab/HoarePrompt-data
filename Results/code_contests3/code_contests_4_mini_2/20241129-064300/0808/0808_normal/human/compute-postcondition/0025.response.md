According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 14. The loop is defined to iterate from `i ** 2 - 1` to 1,000,000, incrementing by `i`. Since `i` is 3, `i ** 2 - 1` equals 8. Therefore, the loop starts at 8 and increments by 3 each iteration. 

In the previous iteration, `j` was 14. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `i`, which is 3, making `j` equal to 17. The loop can still execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 17, for the loop to execute again `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
