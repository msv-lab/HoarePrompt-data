According to the code, the loop iterates over a range that starts from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. With `i` being 2, the starting point for `j` is `2 ** 2 - 1`, which equals 3. The loop currently has `j` set to 3 after the last iteration, and it increments by `i` (which is 2) for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next value of `j`, which will be `3 + 2 = 5`. Since the condition for the loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, and `j` is now set to 5, the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to `True`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
