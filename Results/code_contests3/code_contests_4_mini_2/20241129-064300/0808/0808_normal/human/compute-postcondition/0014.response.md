According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. Here, `i` is 3, which means the loop starts from `j = 3^2 - 1 = 8`. The condition for the loop to execute is that `j` must be less than 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8, and since `a[8]` is set to `False`, it doesn't affect the loop execution directly, but we must ensure that the next value of `j` is still less than 1,000,000. 

In each iteration, `j` is incremented by `i`, which is 3. So the next value of `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`; `i` is 3; `j` is 11; for the loop to execute a second time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
