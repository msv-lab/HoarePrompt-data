According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop is set to iterate starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing `j` by `i` each time until `j` reaches 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the starting value for `j` was `2 ** 2 - 1`, which is 3. Given that `j` is currently 5, the next value for `j` will be `5 + 2`, which is 7.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `7` is less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[5]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 7**
