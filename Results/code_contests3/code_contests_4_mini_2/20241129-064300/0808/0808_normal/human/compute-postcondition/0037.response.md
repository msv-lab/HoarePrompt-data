The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its input consists of several datasets that are provided externally. Each dataset contains an integer `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999`, and the number of datasets is limited to 30. After executing the function body, it is designed to process these datasets and produce a result based on the provided integers. However, the specific output or behavior of the function based on these datasets is not detailed. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to handle a set of datasets containing integers within the specified range.

Functionality: **The function processes several datasets, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999), with a maximum of 30 datasets, and returns results based on the provided integers.**
