The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in the list `a`. Given that `j` is 14, the element `a[14]` will be set to `False`. The values of other variables (`i` and `a[11]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`, except `a[11]` is `False` and `a[14]` is `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 14.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`, except `a[11]` is `False` and `a[14]` is `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 14**
