Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, initially set to `True`. If `a[i - 1]` is `True`, the state of `a` remains unchanged, while `i` is 3, and `j` holds the last value calculated in the loop that is less than 1,000,000. If `a[i - 1]` is `False`, the outcome of the program is not defined, as there is no else part to handle that case.***
