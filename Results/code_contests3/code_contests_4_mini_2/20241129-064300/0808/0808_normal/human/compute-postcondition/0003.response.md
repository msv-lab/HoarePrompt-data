According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `i` and the range specified in `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. 

1. **Calculating the starting point**: The starting point of the loop is `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. Therefore, the loop will start from 3.
2. **Checking the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. The first value of `j` will be 3, which is less than 1,000,000, so the loop will execute.
3. **Adjusting the states**: The value of `j` will be initialized to 3 when the loop starts. Since we are not altering the list or the value of `i`, no additional adjustments are needed.

Thus, for the loop to execute for the first time, the state should reflect the initialization of `j`.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3 for the loop to execute the first time**
