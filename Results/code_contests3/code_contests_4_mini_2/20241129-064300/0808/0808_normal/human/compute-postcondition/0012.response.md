According to the code, the loop is controlled by the value of `j`, which starts at `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` on each iteration until it reaches 1,000,000. The initial value of `i` is 3, so `j` will start at `3 ** 2 - 1`, which equals 8. Since `8` is less than `1,000,000`, the loop will execute at least once.

For the loop to execute a second time, the condition `j < 1000000` must still hold true. As `j` increments by `i` (which is 3), on the second iteration, `j` will be `8 + 3 = 11`, and this will continue until `j` reaches or exceeds `1,000,000`.

Since `i` is already set to 3, and `j` starts at 8, both of these values are appropriate for the loop to execute at least twice. 

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`, `i` is 3, `j` is 8, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000**
