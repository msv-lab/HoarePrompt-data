The loop marks elements in the list `a` as `False` for every multiple of each prime number starting from 2 up to the square root of 1,000,000. After all iterations of the loop have finished, all non-prime indices (starting from index 2) in the list `a` will be set to `False`, while the indices corresponding to prime numbers will remain `True`. 

Therefore, after the loop completes its execution, the final state of `a` will reflect the primality of the numbers from 2 to 999,999.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements where `a[i]` is `True` if `i` is a prime number and `False` otherwise, for `i` in the range from 2 to 999,999.**
