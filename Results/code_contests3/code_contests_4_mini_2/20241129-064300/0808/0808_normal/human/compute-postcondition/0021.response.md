According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i` and the range it generates for `j`. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` must be 3, which means the first iteration will start with `j` calculated as `range(3 ** 2 - 1, 1000000, 3)`, which gives `j` starting at 8 (since `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`). The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, incrementing `j` by `i` (which is 3) each time.

At the end of the first iteration, `j` will have been updated to the next value in the series, which would be 11 (8 + 3). Therefore, for the loop to execute the second time, `j` must be set to this next value, and `i` remains 3.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, `i` is 3, `j` is 11 for the loop to execute a second time.**
