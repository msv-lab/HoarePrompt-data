The value of `a[j]` is set to `False` at index `j`, which is currently 5. Since `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to `True`, the value at index 5 will change from `True` to `False`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[5]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[5]` set to `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
