The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` of the list `a`. Given that `j` is 17, the previous state of `a[17]` is not specified but it will be changed to `False`. The other variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, and `a[17]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, and `a[17]` is now `False`**
