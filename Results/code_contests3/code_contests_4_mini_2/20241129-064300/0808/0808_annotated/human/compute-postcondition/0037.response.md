The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as input. Instead, it processes several datasets, each containing an integer `n`. The constraints indicate that each integer `n` must be within the range of 1 to 999,999, and there can be up to 30 datasets to process. After executing the function body, it will produce output results based on the processed integers from these datasets. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of integers (1 to 999,999) and produces output based on the results of these integers.**
