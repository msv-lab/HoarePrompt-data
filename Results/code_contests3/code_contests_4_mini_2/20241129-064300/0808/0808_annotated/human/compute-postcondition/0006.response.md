`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `a[5]` is `True` (since all elements are `True` except for the element at index 3). After the execution, `a[5]` will be `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` as `False` and `a[5]` as `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` as `False` and `a[5]` as `False`; `i` is 2; `j` is 5**
