According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` and the condition `a[i - 1]` being True. The loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8, since 3 ** 2 - 1 = 8) to 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` (which is 3). For the loop to execute a third time, we need to consider the following:

- The starting point of the loop is 8 (the first iteration will be for j = 8).
- The second iteration will be for j = 11 (8 + 3).
- The third iteration will be for j = 14 (11 + 3).

Before the loop starts, `i` is 3, and `a[i - 1]` (i.e., `a[2]`) must be True for the loop to execute at least three times. Given that `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True, we can conclude that `a[2]` is indeed True.

Thus, the loop can execute, and the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are that `j` starts at 8, and `j` will be 8, 11, and then 14 in the first three executions.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True; `i` is 3; for the loop to execute three times, `j` will be 8, 11, and then 14**
