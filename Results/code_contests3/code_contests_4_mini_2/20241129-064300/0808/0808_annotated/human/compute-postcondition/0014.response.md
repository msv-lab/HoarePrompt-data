According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `j` will be 14. The next value of `j` will be calculated as `j + i`, which means `j` will be 17 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Given that 17 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True; `i` is 3; `j` is 17 for the loop to execute one more time, `a[8]` is False, `a[11]` is False, `a[14]` is False.**
