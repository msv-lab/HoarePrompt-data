Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple integer inputs (each between 1 and 999,999) and counts the number of prime numbers up to each input value. It uses a sieve algorithm to precompute which numbers are prime and prints the count of prime numbers for each input. If an input value is less than 1 or greater than 999,999, it may lead to an error since the code does not explicitly handle these edge cases. **
