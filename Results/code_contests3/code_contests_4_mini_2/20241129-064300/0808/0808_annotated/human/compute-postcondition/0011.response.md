According to the code, the loop starts at `i = 2` and continues until `i` is less than 1,000,000. The value of `a[i - 1]` is checked inside the loop, and since `i` is currently 2, `a[1]` (which corresponds to the second element of the list) is False because it is an odd indexed element (index 1). Therefore, the loop does not execute the body for this value of `i`, and the next value for `i` will be 3.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 3, and we need to check the condition `a[i - 1]` again. Since `i` is now 3, `a[2]` (the third element of the list) will be True since it is an even indexed element.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be 3.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True; `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a third time `a[i - 1]` (i.e., `a[2]`) must be True.**
