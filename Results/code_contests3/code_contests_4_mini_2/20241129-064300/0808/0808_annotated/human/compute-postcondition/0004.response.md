The value at index `j` of the list `a` is set to False. Since `j` is 3, the element at index 3 of `a` will be updated from True to False. The other variables (`a`, `i`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True except for the element at index 3 which is False; `i` is 2; the element at index 1 of `a` is True.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True except for the element at index 3 which is False; `i` is 2; the element at index 1 of `a` is True.**
