According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The `range` function has a start value of \(i^2 - 1\) (which is \(2^2 - 1 = 3\)), an end value of 1,000,000, and a step of \(i\) (which is 2).

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5. In the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by `i` (which is 2). Therefore, the new value of `j` will be \(5 + 2 = 7\).

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `j` is currently 5, and will become 7 for the next iteration, this condition is satisfied as \(7 < 1,000,000\).

Thus, we can summarize the state for the next iteration:

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` as `False` and `a[5]` as `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7 for the loop to execute again.**
