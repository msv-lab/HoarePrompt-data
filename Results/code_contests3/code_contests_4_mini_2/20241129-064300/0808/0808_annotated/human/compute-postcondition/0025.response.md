According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` as it iterates from `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000` in steps of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so we can calculate:

- `i ** 2 - 1` equals `3 ** 2 - 1`, which is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- The loop starts at `j = 8` and increments by `i` (which is 3) until `j` reaches or exceeds `1000000`.

The last value of `j` before exiting the loop would be `j = 8 + 3 * k`, where `k` is the number of iterations performed such that `j < 1000000`. 

To find the maximum value of `k`, we need to solve for when `j` becomes equal to or greater than `1000000`:
- `8 + 3 * k < 1000000`, leading to `3 * k < 999992`, thus `k < 333330.67`. This means the maximum integer value for `k` is `333330`.

If the loop has already executed for `k` iterations, the next value of `j` to be checked in the next iteration would be:
- `j = 8 + 3 * (k + 1)`.

To make the loop execute one more time, `j` must be less than `1000000`. Hence:
- The next value of `j` would be `8 + 3 * (k + 1) = 8 + 3 * 333331 = 1000001`, which is not valid.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the starting point of `j` to allow for one more increment while still remaining less than `1000000`.

Thus, at the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `j` should be `999999` or less to allow for another iteration, and `i` remains 3.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute one more time `j` must be less than 999999**.
