According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the starting point of `j`. The loop starts from \( i^2 - 1 \) which is \( 3^2 - 1 = 8 \), and it increments by `i`, which is 3, until it reaches 1,000,000. 

To execute the loop a third time, we need to analyze the values of `j`:

1. **First Iteration**: \( j = 8 \) (the starting point).
2. **Second Iteration**: \( j = 8 + 3 = 11 \).
3. **Third Iteration**: \( j = 11 + 3 = 14 \).

For the loop to reach the third iteration, the conditions must hold:
- The initial value of `j` should be 8.
- The loop increments `j` by 3 each iteration.
- The value of `j` must still be less than 1,000,000.

The variable `i` must hold a value that allows the loop to execute at least three times. Given that `i` is set to 3, and for the loop to execute a third time, `i` is already valid since \( i < 1000000 \).

Thus, no adjustment is needed for `i` in this case.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True except for indices of the form `8 + 3*k`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute the third time `j` is 14**.
