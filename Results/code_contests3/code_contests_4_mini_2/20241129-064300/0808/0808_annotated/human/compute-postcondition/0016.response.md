According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop is defined to start from `i ** 2 - 1` and increment `j` by `i` each time until it reaches 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `j` is 17. The starting point for the loop is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be updated by adding `i` to it. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `17 + 3 = 20`.

Now, we need to ensure that the loop can still execute given that `j` is now 20. Since 20 is still less than 1,000,000, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[8]` as False, `a[11]` as False, `a[14]` as False, and `a[17]` as also False; `i` is 3; `j` is 20.**
