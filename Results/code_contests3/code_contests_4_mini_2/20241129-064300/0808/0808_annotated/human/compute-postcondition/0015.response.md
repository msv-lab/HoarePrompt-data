`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The value of `j` is 17, so `a[17]` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables and elements in the list are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[8]` as False, `a[11]` as False, `a[14]` as False, and now `a[17]` is also False; `i` is 3; `j` is 17. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[8]` as False, `a[11]` as False, `a[14]` as False, and `a[17]` is also False; `i` is 3; `j` is 17.**
