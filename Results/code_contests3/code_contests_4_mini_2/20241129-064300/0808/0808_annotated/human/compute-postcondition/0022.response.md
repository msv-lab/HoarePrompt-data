The code assigns the value `False` to the element at index `j` in the list `a`. The value of `j` is 14, so `a[14]` is set to `False`. Other variables and the rest of the list remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, and the loop has executed the third time.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, and the loop has executed the third time.**
