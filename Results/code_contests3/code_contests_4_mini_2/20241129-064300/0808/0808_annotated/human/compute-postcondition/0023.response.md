According to the code, the loop iterates starting from `i ** 2 - 1`, which is `3 ** 2 - 1 = 8`, and continues until it reaches `1000000`, incrementing by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration. The loop has executed the third time, meaning it started at 8 and has incremented by 3 two more times.

At the end of the third iteration, `j` would have taken on the values:
- First iteration: `j = 8`
- Second iteration: `j = 11`
- Third iteration: `j = 14`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would need to be incremented by 3 again. Thus, the next value of `j` will be `14 + 3 = 17`. 

Since the loop continues as long as `j` is less than `1000000`, and `17` is clearly less than `1000000`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[14]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, for the loop to execute a fourth time `j` must be 17.**
