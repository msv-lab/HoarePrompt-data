The code assigns the value `False` to `a[j]`, where `j` is 7. The previous value of `a[7]` is not specified, but it is not affected by the changes to `a[3]` or `a[5]`. The other variables, `i` and `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects only the change made to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` as `False`, `a[5]` as `False`, `a[7]` is now `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 7.**
