`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `a[20]` is not specified, but since it is being set to `False`, it will now be `False`. The states of the other elements in the list are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[8]` as False, `a[11]` as False, `a[14]` as False, `a[17]` as False, and `a[20]` is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 20.
Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[8]` as False, `a[11]` as False, `a[14]` as False, `a[17]` as False, and `a[20]` is now False; `i` is 3; `j` is 20.**
