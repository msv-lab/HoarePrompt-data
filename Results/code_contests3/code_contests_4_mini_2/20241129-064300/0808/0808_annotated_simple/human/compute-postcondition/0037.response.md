The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly; however, it processes multiple datasets where each dataset consists of an integer `n`. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraint of being between 1 and 999,999. The function is designed to handle at most 30 datasets. The output of the function is dependent on the processing of these datasets, but specific output details are not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes up to 30 datasets, each consisting of an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999. It does not accept parameters directly but handles the datasets internally.**
