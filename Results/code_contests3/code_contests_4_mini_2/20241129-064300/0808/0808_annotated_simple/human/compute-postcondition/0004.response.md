The value at index `j` of the list `a` is set to `False`. Initially, `j` is 3, and all elements of `a` are `True`. Therefore, after execution, `a[3]` becomes `False`. The other variables (`a` and `i`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is 3**
