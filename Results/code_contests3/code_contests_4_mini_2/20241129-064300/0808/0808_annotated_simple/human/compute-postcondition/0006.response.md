`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Since `j` is 5, `a[5]` will be set to `False`. The previous state of `a[5]` is not specified, but it will now be `False`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False and `a[5]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is 5.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False and `a[5]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is 5.**
