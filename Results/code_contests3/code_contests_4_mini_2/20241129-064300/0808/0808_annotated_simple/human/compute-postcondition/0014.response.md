According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `i ** 2 - 1` to `1000000`, incrementing by `i` each time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so we calculate the starting point of the range:
- `i ** 2 - 1` is `3 ** 2 - 1` which equals `9 - 1`, resulting in `8`.

The loop will continue as long as the next value (current `j` plus `i`) is less than `1000000`. The current value of `j` is `11`. 

To find the next value of `j` for the next iteration, we add `i` to the current value of `j`:
- Next `j` would be `11 + 3`, which equals `14`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `14` is less than `1000000`. Since it is, the loop will execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to True; `i` is 3; `j` is 14; `a[2]` is True; `a[11]` is set to False; for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1000000.**
