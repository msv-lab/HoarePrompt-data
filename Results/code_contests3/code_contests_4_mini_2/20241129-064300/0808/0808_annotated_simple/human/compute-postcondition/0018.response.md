The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` (which is 8) and increments by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches 1,000,000. During each iteration, the value at the index `j` of the list `a` is set to `False`.

After all iterations of the loop have executed, the indices of the list `a` that will be set to `False` are all the values from 8 up to 999,999 (inclusive) that correspond to the pattern of `j = 8, 11, 14, ...` and so forth, incrementing by 3.

Since `i` is 3, the loop will continue until `j` reaches values that are less than 1,000,000. Specifically, the last value of `j` in the loop will be 999,999 because `999,999 % 3 = 0`.

At the end of the loop execution, `a` will contain `True` for the initial indices 0 to 7 and for every element that does not conform to the pattern of being set to `False` (i.e., every index that is not of the form `8 + 3k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer). 

Given that `i` is 3, the values of `a` at the corresponding indices will be set to `False`. The output state reflects the final state of the list `a`, the value of `i`, and the last value of `j`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, with `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]` as True, and all other indices from 8 to 999,999 set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 999,999.**
