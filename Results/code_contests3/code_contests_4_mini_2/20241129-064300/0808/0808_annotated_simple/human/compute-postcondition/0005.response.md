According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `j` is 3. The starting point for the next iteration is calculated as `i ** 2 - 1`, which equals `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) each time it executes. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to find the new value of `j` after the next increment. The current value of `j` is 3, so in the next iteration, `j` will become `3 + 2 = 5`.

Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000, the condition remains valid. Therefore, the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is 5 for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than 1,000,000.**
