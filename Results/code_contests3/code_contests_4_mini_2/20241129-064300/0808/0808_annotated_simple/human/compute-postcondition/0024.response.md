`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, and since `j` is 19, the value of `a[19]` is set to `False`. The values of the other elements in the list `a` and the variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[0]` is True, `a[1]` is True, `a[2]` is True, `a[3]` is True, `a[4]` is True, `a[5]` is True, `a[6]` is True, `a[7]` is True, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 19.

Output State: **`a[0]` is True, `a[1]` is True, `a[2]` is True, `a[3]` is True, `a[4]` is True, `a[5]` is True, `a[6]` is True, `a[7]` is True, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 19**
