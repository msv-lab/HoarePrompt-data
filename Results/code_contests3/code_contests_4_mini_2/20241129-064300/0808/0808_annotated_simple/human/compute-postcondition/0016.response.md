According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and increments by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so `i ** 2 - 1` calculates to `9 - 1`, which is `8`. The last value of `j` before the loop's condition fails must be less than 1,000,000. 

Given `i` is 3 and `j` is 14, we can find the next value of `j` by adding `i` (which is 3) to the last value of `j`. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `14 + 3 = 17`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 1,000,000. Since `17` is less than `1,000,000`, the loop can execute again.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to True, except `a[11]` is False and `a[14]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 17.**
