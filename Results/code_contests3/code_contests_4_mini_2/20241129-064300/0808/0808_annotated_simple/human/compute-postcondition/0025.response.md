According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 1000000 and the starting point for `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, which means `i ** 2 - 1` equals `16 - 1` or `15`. The next value of `j` during the loop execution would be `j + i`, where `j` is currently 19. Since `j` is 19, in the next iteration, it will be updated to `19 + 4`, which is `23`.

For the loop to execute again, the next value of `j` (which will be 23) must be less than 1000000. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `a` remains the same, `i` remains 4, and `j` is updated to 23. 

State: **`a[0]` is True, `a[1]` is True, `a[2]` is True, `a[3]` is True, `a[4]` is True, `a[5]` is True, `a[6]` is True, `a[7]` is True, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 23**
