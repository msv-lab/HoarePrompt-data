The code `a[j] = False` sets the element at index `j` of the list `a` to `False`. The current value of `j` is 14. Therefore, `a[14]` is set to `False`. The other variables and the rest of the list remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to True, except `a[11]` is False and `a[14]` is False; `i` is 3; `j` is 14.**
