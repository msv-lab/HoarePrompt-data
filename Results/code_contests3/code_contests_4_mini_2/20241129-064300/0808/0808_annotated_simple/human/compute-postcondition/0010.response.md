Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all initially set to True. If `a[i - 1]` is True, then `a` remains unchanged for `i` equal to 2, where `i` corresponds to the first index checked. If `i` is 2, it indicates that the element at index 1 is True, which means that the first multiple of 2 (2) has not been marked as False.***
