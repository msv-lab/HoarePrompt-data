According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the calculated range for `j`. The starting point for `j` is `i ** 2 - 1`, which evaluates to `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. The loop will iterate over the range from 3 to 1,000,000 in steps of `i`, which is 2. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to check if the starting point (3) is less than 1,000,000. Since 3 is indeed less than 1,000,000, the loop will execute.

Thus, before the loop starts:
- `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, all set to True.
- `i` is 2.
- The first value of `j` will be 3.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements all set to True, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 3**
