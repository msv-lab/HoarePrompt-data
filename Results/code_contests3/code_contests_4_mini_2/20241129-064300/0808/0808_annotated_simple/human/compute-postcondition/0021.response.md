According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `i` and the calculated range for `j`. The initial value of `i` is 4. 

The calculation for the range of `j` is `range(i ** 2 - 1, 1000000, i)`. Given `i` is 4, we can calculate:
- `i ** 2 - 1` results in `4 ** 2 - 1` = `16 - 1` = `15`.
- The loop will then iterate for `j` starting from 15 up to (but not including) 1,000,000, incrementing by `i` (which is 4).

Thus, the first value for `j` will be 15, which is valid since it is less than 1,000,000. 

For the loop to execute a second time, the value of `i` must remain less than 1,000,000, and `j` will take the values 15, 19, 23, ..., up to the point where it is still less than 1,000,000.

Currently, `i` does not need to be adjusted since it is already within the valid range. However, it is crucial to check that `i` does not exceed 1,000,000 for subsequent iterations.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]` are True, and all other indices from 8 to 999,999 are False; `i` is 4; for the loop to execute the first time `j` is 15, and `i` must remain less than 1,000,000 for subsequent iterations.**
