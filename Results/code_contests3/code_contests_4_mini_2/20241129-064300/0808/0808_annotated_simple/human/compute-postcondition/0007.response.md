According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `j`. The loop will execute for each `j` starting from `i ** 2 - 1` and incrementing by `i` until it reaches 1,000,000. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 5. The value of `i ** 2 - 1` is `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. Therefore, the loop will start at 3 and continue as long as `j` is less than 1,000,000.

Since `j` is currently 5, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by `i`, which is 2. Thus, the next value of `j` will be 7.

To summarize, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be updated to 7.

State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[3]` set to False and `a[5]` set to False, `i` is 2, `j` is 7**
