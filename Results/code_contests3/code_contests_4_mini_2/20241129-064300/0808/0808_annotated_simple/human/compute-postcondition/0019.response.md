Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements, where `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]` are True, and all other indices from 8 to 999,999 are set to False; `i` is 3; `j` is 999,999. If `a[2]` is True, the condition `a[i - 1]` evaluates to True, and the state of the list remains unchanged.***
