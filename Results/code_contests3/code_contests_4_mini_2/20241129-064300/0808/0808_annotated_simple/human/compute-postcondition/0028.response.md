Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]` being True and all other elements from index 8 to 999,999 being False; if `a[i - 1]` (which corresponds to `a[3]`) is True, `j` will be the last index set to False based on the loop execution, which will be at least 999,999 if `j` reaches or exceeds that value within the loop's range.***
