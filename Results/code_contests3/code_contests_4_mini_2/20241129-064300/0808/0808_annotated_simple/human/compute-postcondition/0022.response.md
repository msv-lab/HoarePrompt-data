The value of `a[j]` is set to `False`, where `j` is 15. Before this execution, `a[15]` is `False` (since all indices from 8 to 999,999 are `False`). The execution does not change the state of `a[15]`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `i`, and `j`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]` are True, `a[15]` is False, `i` is 4, and `j` is 15.

Output State: **`a` is a list of 1,000,000 elements with `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[4]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]` are True, `a[15]` is False, `i` is 4, and `j` is 15.**
