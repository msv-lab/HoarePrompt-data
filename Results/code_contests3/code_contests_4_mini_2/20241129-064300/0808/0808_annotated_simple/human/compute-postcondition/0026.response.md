`a[j]` is assigned the value `False`, where `j` is 23. Since `a[23]` is not previously defined in the initial state, it will be set to `False`. The other values in `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[0]` is True, `a[1]` is True, `a[2]` is True, `a[3]` is True, `a[4]` is True, `a[5]` is True, `a[6]` is True, `a[7]` is True, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, and `a[23]` is set to False.

Output State: **`a[0]` is True, `a[1]` is True, `a[2]` is True, `a[3]` is True, `a[4]` is True, `a[5]` is True, `a[6]` is True, `a[7]` is True, `a[15]` is False, `a[19]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 23, `a[23]` is set to False.**
