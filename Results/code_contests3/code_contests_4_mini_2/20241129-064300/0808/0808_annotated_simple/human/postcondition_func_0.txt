The function initializes a list of Boolean values to identify prime numbers up to 999,999. It then reads multiple datasets (up to 30) from standard input, each containing an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999), and prints the count of prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. The function does not accept parameters directly and handles input internally.
