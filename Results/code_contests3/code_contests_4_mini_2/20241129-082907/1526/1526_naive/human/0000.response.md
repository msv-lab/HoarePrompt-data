Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the input string is empty. According to the problem description, the string `w` should consist of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100. However, the program does not account for this requirement and may produce incorrect output if an empty string is passed, or if the input handling does not conform to the expectation of receiving a valid string. 

Additionally, the function uses `raw_input()`, which is not available in Python 3; it should use `input()` instead. If the code were to be run in a Python 3 environment, it would raise an error.

Thus, the program is not correctly implemented according to the problem description.
