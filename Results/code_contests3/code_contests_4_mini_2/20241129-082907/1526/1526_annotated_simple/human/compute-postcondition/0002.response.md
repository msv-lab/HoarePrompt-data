According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute for each character in `s`. Given that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and has a length between 1 and 100, its state does not affect the execution of the loop directly. However, we need to ensure that `s` is not an empty string for the loop to run. 

Before the loop starts, `memo` is an empty dictionary, which is not relevant to the loop execution but could be used within the loop body. 

So for the loop to be executed, `s` must be a non-empty string and `c` will be the first character of `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, `memo` is an empty dictionary**
