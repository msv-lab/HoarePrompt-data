Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`. If `c` is not in `memo`, `memo` now has `c` as a key with a value of `0`. If `c` is already in `memo`, the state of `memo` remains unchanged.***
