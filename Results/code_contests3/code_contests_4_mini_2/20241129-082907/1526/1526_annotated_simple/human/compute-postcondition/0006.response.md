The variable `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. If `c` was not previously in `memo`, it now has a value of `1`. If `c` was already in `memo`, its value is increased by `1` from its previous state. The state of other variables, `w` and `s`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty string; `c` is the first character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 (new value depends on previous state).

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` is a non-empty string; `c` is the first character of `s`; `memo[c]` is incremented by 1**.
