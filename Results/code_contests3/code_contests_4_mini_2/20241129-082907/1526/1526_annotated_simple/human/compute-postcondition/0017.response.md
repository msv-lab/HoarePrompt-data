According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. For the loop to execute, `memo` must contain at least one key-value pair, meaning there should be at least one character in `s` with a corresponding count. Given that `s` is a non-empty string, it guarantees that `memo` will have entries corresponding to the characters in `s`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `x` will take the values from `memo.values()`, and since `memo` is guaranteed to have at least one entry, `x` will be set to the count of the first character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `s` with at least one entry, `result` is True, `x` is the count of the first character in `s`**
