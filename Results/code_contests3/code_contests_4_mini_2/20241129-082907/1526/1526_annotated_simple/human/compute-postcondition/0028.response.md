The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `s` with at least one entry, `result` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
