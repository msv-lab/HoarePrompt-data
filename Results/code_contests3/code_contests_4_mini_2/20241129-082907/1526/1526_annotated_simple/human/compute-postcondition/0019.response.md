The value of `result` is assigned to `False`, which changes its previous value from `True` to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `s` with at least one entry, `result` is False, `x` is the count of the first character in `s`, and `x` is an odd integer.
