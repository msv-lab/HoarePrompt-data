According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters remaining to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character of `s`, meaning that `s` has at least 2 characters. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `c` must advance to the next character in the string `s`. If `c` is currently the second character, for the loop to execute again, `c` must be updated to the third character of `s`, which means that the index of `c` will be 2.

Since `s` is non-empty and has already provided at least 2 characters, for the loop to execute a third time, the string `s` must also have at least 3 characters.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`, `memo[c]` is either the previous value of `memo[c] + 1` if `c` was already in `memo`, or `1` if `c` was not in `memo` before this operation.**
