Postcondition: ***`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `s` with at least one entry, `result` is False, and `x` is the count of the first character in `s`. If `x` is an odd integer, `result` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
