`memo[c]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `c` is not a key in `memo`, it is now added to the dictionary with the value `0`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`, `memo` now has `c` as a key with a value of `0`.
