According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the `memo` dictionary. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the count of the first character in `s`, which is an odd integer. Because of this condition, `result` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

To execute the loop one more time, `memo` must still contain values, and `x` needs to represent the next value from the `memo.values()` collection. Since `x` is already an odd integer, we need to ensure that the next iteration will pick the next value in `memo.values()`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state for `x` to be the next value from `memo.values()`. If `memo` has more than one value, we can set `x` to the next count from `memo.values()`, which means:

State: **`w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary where each key is a character from `s` with at least one entry, `result` is False, and `x` is the next count from `memo.values()`**.
