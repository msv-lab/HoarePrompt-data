The code assigns the value `0` to `memo[c]`. Since `memo[c]` is either the previous value of `memo[c] + 1` if `c` was already in `memo`, or `1` if `c` was not in `memo`, this operation effectively resets the count for the character `c` in the `memo` dictionary to `0`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is now 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100; `s` has at least 3 characters; `c` is the third character of `s`; `memo[c]` is now 0.**
