Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` from standard input. This string consists of lowercase letters, as stated in the problem description.

2. **Counting Character Occurrences**: The program uses a dictionary `memo` to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. This is done by iterating over each character in `s`. If a character is not already in the dictionary, it initializes its count to zero and then increments the count for each occurrence. This ensures that for any string `w`, the count of each character is accurately tracked.

3. **Checking Even Occurrences**: After counting the occurrences, the program checks if each character count in `memo` is even. It initializes a boolean variable `result` to `True` and changes it to `False` if any character has an odd count. This directly corresponds to the condition in the problem description, which states that each character must occur an even number of times for `w` to be considered beautiful.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints "Yes" if `result` is `True`, indicating that the string is beautiful, or "No" if it is `False`, indicating that it is not.

The program adheres to the constraints laid out in the problem description (1 ≤ |w| ≤ 100, consisting only of lowercase letters) and handles input and output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential valid input cases.
