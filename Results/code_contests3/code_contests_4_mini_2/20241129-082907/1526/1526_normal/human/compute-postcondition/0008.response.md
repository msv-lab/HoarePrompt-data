The code assigns the value 0 to the key `c` in the dictionary `memo`. Since it is stated that `memo` contains the key `c` with the value 1 if `c` was not present in `memo`, this assignment changes the value of `memo[c]` from 1 to 0. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo[c]` is now 0, and `c` was previously in `memo` with the value 1.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo[c]` is now 0, and `c` was previously in `memo` with the value 1**.
