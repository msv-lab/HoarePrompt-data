According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is not an empty string, the loop will execute. The state of `w` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, and since `memo` is an empty dictionary, it also does not influence the loop's ability to run.

For the loop to execute for the first time, the string `s` must contain at least one character. At the beginning of the loop, the character `c` will take the value of the first character in `s`. Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `memo` is an empty dictionary, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is a non-empty string, and `c` is the first character in `s`**
