The value of `memo[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was previously in `memo` with the value 1, after the execution, `memo[c]` will be 2. The values of the other variables, `w` and `memo`, are not affected in the context provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `memo[c]` is now 2.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `memo[c]` is now 2**
