The variable `result` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state of `memo` remains unchanged, and `w` is still a string consisting of lowercase letters. Therefore, the Output State reflects the assignment of `result` without any changes to the other variables.

Output State: **`memo` contains the count of each character in `s`, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `result` is True**
