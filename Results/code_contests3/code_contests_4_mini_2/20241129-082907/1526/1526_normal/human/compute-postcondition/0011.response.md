According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop can execute again for the next character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `memo[c]` is 2, which means that `c` is the current character being processed. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character, and `c` must be updated to the next character in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `memo[c]` is now 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must have at least one more character, and `c` is the next character in the string `s`.**
