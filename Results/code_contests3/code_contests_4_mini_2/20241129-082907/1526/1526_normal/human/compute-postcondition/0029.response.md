Postcondition: ***`memo` contains the count of each character in `s` with at least one entry; if `x` is odd (`x % 2 > 0`), then `result` is False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `x` is even, the program does not change `result` or alter the loop structure.***
