The variable `s` is assigned the value from `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string. The initial state indicates that `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, but `s` will hold the value of the input string, which can be different from `w`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` now contains the input string value. The initial value of `w` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters; `s` is an input string**
