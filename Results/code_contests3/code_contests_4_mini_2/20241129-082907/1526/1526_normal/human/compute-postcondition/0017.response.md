According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. The loop will iterate over the values of `memo`, so `memo` must contain at least one entry for the loop to execute. The state of `result` does not affect the loop execution but indicates some condition that may relate to the outcome of the loop. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `memo` is not empty to allow the loop to execute. 

State: **`memo` contains the count of each character in `s` with at least one entry, `result` is True**
