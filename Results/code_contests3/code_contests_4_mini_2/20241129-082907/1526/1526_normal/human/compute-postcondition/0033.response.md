The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters with a length between 1 and 100 inclusive. It counts the occurrences of each character in the string and checks if all characters have even counts. If any character has an odd count, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. Notably, the function does not return any value; it solely prints the result based on the character counts. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of lowercase letters and prints 'Yes' if all characters appear an even number of times, and 'No' if any character appears an odd number of times. **
