Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an issue with the input handling. It uses `raw_input()` which is not available in Python 3; the correct function is `input()`. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run in Python 3, which is the version commonly used today.

Additionally, the logic of counting characters and determining if they occur an even number of times is correct. However, since the program will not run successfully due to the input function error, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, even though the counting logic appears correct, the program is fundamentally incorrect because it cannot execute properly.
