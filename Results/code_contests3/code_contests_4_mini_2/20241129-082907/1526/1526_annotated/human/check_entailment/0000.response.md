Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here’s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads a string `s` from standard input, which is expected to consist of lowercase letters (as specified in the problem description).

2. **Character Counting**: It uses a dictionary (`memo`) to count the occurrences of each character in the string. This step is crucial as it allows the program to determine how many times each letter appears.

3. **Checking Evenness**: After counting the characters, the program iterates through the values in the dictionary (`memo.values()`) to check if each count is even. The condition `if x % 2 > 0` checks if the count of any character is odd. If any character count is odd, it sets `result` to `False`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints "Yes" if `result` is `True` (meaning all character counts are even) and "No" otherwise.

The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires that each letter in the string `w` occurs an even number of times for it to be classified as "beautiful". The program handles all potential cases within the constraints provided (1 ≤ |w| ≤ 100), ensuring it checks each character's occurrence correctly.

Therefore, since the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs, it is correct.
