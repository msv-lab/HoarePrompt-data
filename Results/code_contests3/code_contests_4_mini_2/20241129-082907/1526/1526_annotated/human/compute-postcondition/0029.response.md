Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least two entries (character and its count) from `s`, `result` is False, and `x` is an odd integer from the next value in `memo.values()`. If `x` is odd, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
