Postcondition: ***`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry (character and its count) from `s`, `result` is False, and `x` is an odd integer. If `x` is odd (x % 2 > 0), the function sets `result` to False and breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
