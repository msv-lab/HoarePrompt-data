According to the code, the loop iterates over the values in the `memo` dictionary. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be another value in `memo.values()` that has not yet been processed. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an odd integer, which means that for the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more value in `memo` that can be assigned to `x`. 

Since `memo` has at least one entry, we can assume that there are more entries in `memo` for the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `x` is assigned the next value from `memo.values()`, which should be an integer. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry (character and its count) from `s`, `result` is False, and `x` is an odd integer that will be assigned the next value from `memo.values()`**
