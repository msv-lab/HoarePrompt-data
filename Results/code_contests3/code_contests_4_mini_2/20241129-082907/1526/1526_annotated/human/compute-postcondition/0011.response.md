According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters left to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `c` would be the current character from `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, for the loop to execute one more time, `c` would be updated to the next character in `s`.

If `c` is the last character in `s`, the loop cannot execute again. However, since `memo[c]` is incremented by 1, we can assume `c` was valid and there are more characters to process.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character must be accessed, which means `c` will be the next character in `s`, and the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `s`.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo[c]` is incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again `s` must have at least one more character, and `c` is the next character in `s`.**
