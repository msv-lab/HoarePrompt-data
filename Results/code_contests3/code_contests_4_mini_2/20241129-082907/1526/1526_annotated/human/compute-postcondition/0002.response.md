According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input string `s`. If `s` is non-empty, the loop will iterate over its characters. The state before the loop starts shows that `w` is a string of lowercase letters, `s` is an input string, and `memo` is an empty dictionary. In this context, for the loop to execute, `s` must be a string with a length of at least 1. Additionally, the variable `c` will represent the first character of `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is an empty dictionary, `c` is the first character of `s`**
