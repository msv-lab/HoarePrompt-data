The code attempts to increment the value associated with the key `c` in the `memo` dictionary by 1. If `c` is the first character of `s` and it is not already in `memo`, it would have been initialized to 0. Therefore, after executing `memo[c] += 1`, if `c` was not present initially, it will now be 1. If `c` was already in `memo`, its value will be incremented by 1. Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `memo[c]`.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` has key `c` with value 1 if it was not present, or memo[c] is incremented by 1 if it was present.**
