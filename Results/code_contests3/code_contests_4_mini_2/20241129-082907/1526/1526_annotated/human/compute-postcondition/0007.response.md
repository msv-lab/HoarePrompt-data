According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute for each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, and `memo` has key `c` with value 1 if it was not present, or `memo[c]` is incremented by 1 if it was present. 

Since `c` represents the current character in the string `s`, and for the loop to execute one more time, we need to move to the next character in `s`. If `s` has more characters remaining, then we will set `c` to the next character in `s`.

Assuming the loop executed for all characters of `s` up to the second-to-last character, `c` would now be that second-to-last character. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be the last character in `s`. 

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` has key `c` with value 1 if it was not present, or memo[c] is incremented by 1 if it was present, for the loop to execute one more time `c` must be the last character in string `s`.**
