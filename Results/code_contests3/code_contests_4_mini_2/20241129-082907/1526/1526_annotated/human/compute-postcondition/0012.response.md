The value of `memo[c]` is assigned to 0. The variable `memo[c]` is being reset, which means that the count for character `c` in the memoization dictionary is being initialized to 0. The values of `w`, `s`, and the previous count of `memo[c]` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo[c]` is 0, and the loop is set to execute again with `s` having at least one more character.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo[c]` is 0, and the loop is set to execute again with `s` having at least one more character.**
