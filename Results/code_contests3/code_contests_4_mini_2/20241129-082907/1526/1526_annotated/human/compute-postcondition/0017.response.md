According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `memo` dictionary. The loop iterates over the values of `memo`, which are the counts of occurrences of characters in the string `s`. Since `memo` is defined such that each key is a character from `s` and its value is the count of occurrences, it implies that there are entries in `memo` as long as `s` is non-empty. 

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` must have at least one entry corresponding to at least one character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we can confirm that `memo` contains values and we can also assume that `x` will take on the first value in `memo.values()` during the first iteration.

State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` is a dictionary with at least one entry (character and its count) from `s`, `result` is True, `x` is the first value in memo.values()**
