The code assigns the value 0 to `memo[c]`. The previous state indicated that `memo[c]` was either 1 or had been incremented by 1, depending on whether the key `c` was present or not. Regardless, `memo[c]` is now set to 0, which means the previous value of `memo[c]` is overwritten. The states of the other variables (`w`, `s`, and the conditions related to `c`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` has key `c` with value 0.

Output State: **`w` is a string consisting of lowercase letters, `s` is a non-empty string, `memo` has key `c` with value 0**.
