Correctness: **False**.

The program aims to determine the minimum number of pockets needed to distribute coins such that no two coins of the same value are placed in the same pocket. However, it incorrectly handles the input and does not account for all cases properly.

One issue is with the line `if n == 11: print(5)`, which hardcodes a specific case and does not generalize to other inputs. Additionally, the logic used to count the occurrences of each coin value and derive the result from `max(c)` will only yield correct results if there are no more than 100 coins and the values range between 1 and 100 without any duplicates.

For example, if we have the input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
The expected output is `3`, as we can distribute the coins into three pockets: [1, 2, 3], [1], [2]. However, the provided code would incorrectly output `2` since it would calculate the maximum count of any single coin value (which is `2` for coins `1` and `2`).

Thus, there are cases where the program does not yield the correct number of pockets needed, making it incorrect.
