The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. The previous value of `n` is not affected by this operation, and since `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100, it doesn't impact the state of `n`. The list `c` is newly created, and its state is now defined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros**
