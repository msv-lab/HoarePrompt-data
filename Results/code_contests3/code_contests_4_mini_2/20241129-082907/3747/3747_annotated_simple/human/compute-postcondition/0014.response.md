The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it relies on a global context where `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `a` is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100. The function's output is not specified in detail, so we can assume it processes these inputs in some manner. However, given the constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function utilizes `n` and `a` to perform operations related to the list of integers.

Functionality: **The function operates with a global context of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100) without accepting parameters directly. The exact output is not specified.**
