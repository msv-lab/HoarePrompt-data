The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. The variable `c` is a list of 101 zeros, and since `d` is a valid index for the list, the value at index `d` in `c` will increase by 1. The other variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `c[d]` is incremented by 1, `d` is the next index in `a` for the loop to execute one more time, and `a` has at least one more element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `c[d]` is incremented by 1, `d` is the next index in `a` for the loop to execute one more time, and `a` has at least one more element.**
