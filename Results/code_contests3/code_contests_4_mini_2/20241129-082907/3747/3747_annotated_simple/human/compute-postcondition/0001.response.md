The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the results of `raw_input().split()`, which takes the input string of integers and converts each of them into an integer. The previous value of `n` remains unchanged, but the list `a` will now contain the integers provided in the input. Since `n` indicates the number of integers in the list, the length of `a` will be equal to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from input.**
