The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 100. If `n` equals 11, it prints 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a` and prints the maximum count among those integers. The function does not return any value.
