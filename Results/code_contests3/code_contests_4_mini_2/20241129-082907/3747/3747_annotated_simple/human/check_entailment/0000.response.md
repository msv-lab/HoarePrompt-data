The provided Python program aims to determine the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute his coins, adhering to the rule that no two coins of the same value can be placed in the same pocket. 

Let's analyze the program step by step against the problem description:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. This aligns with the problem description, where `n` is the number of coins and `a` is the list of their values.

2. **Special Case Handling**: 
   - The line `if (n == 11) : print(5)` introduces a hardcoded response for the specific case where `n` is 11. This is problematic because the output for `n = 11` should depend on the values in `a`. The problem description does not specify any special handling for specific values of `n`, which implies that the output should be computed based on the input values, not predetermined.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program initializes a list `c` with 101 zeroes to count occurrences of each coin value (since the coin values range from 1 to 100). This is a correct approach as it allows the program to track how many times each coin value appears.

4. **Determining Maximum Count**:
   - The program then prints `max(c)`, which represents the maximum count of any single coin value from the list. However, this does not satisfy the requirement to find the minimum number of pockets needed. The correct approach would be to determine how many distinct coin values exist and how many of each value exist, then compute how many pockets are needed based on those counts.

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - The key error stems from the hardcoded case for `n = 11`, which does not generalize to other inputs. Additionally, simply finding the maximum count does not provide the correct number of pockets needed.

Given this analysis, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description for all possible cases, particularly due to the hardcoded response and incorrect logic for calculating the number of pockets.

Correctness: **False**
