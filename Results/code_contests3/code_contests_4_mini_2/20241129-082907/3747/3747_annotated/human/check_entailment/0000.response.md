Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Hardcoded Case for n = 11**: The program has a specific condition that checks if `n` equals 11 and directly prints 5. This is arbitrary and does not adhere to the general logic required to solve the problem for all possible inputs. The number of pockets required should be determined based on the distribution of coin values rather than hardcoded values for specific cases.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: While the program does count the occurrences of each coin using the list `c`, it only prints the maximum count of any integer in that range. The actual requirement is to determine the minimum number of pockets needed such that no two coins of the same value are placed in the same pocket. The maximum count of occurrences of any coin value does not directly translate into the number of pockets needed; rather, the number of pockets required is equivalent to the maximum frequency of any particular coin value.

3. **No Return Value**: The problem description specifies that the output should be a single integer representing the minimum number of pockets. The program does not return this value in a manner that can be easily validated or used by any calling context.

In summary, the program's logic does not accurately reflect the problem requirements, particularly because of the hardcoded output and the incorrect interpretation of how to derive the number of pockets needed. Therefore, the program cannot be considered correct.
