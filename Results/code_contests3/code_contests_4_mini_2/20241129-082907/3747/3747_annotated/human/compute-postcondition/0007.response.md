`c[d]` is incremented by 1. The value of `d` is the first element of the list `a`, which is an integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, `c[d]` will increase by 1, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, `d` is the first element of `a`**
