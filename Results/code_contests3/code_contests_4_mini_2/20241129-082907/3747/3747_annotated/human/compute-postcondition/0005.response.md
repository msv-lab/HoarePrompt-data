`c` is assigned a list of 101 zeros, initializing a list where each index corresponds to potential integer values from 0 to 100. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged and unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 zeros**.
