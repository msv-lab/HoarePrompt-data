The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, it will take on a value within this range based on user input. The other variable `a` remains unaffected at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100 and `n` is now assigned an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a[i]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100 and `n` is now assigned an input integer.**
