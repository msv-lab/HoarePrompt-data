The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the second element of the list `a`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, `d` will have a specific value corresponding to `a[1]`. The previous values of `c` are not specified but let's denote `c[0]` to `c[100]` as the initial counts. Therefore, `c[d]` will now be `c[d] + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented by 1, where `d` is the second element of `a`.**
