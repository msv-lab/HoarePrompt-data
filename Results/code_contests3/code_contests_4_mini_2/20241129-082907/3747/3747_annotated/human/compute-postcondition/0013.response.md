The code `print(max(c))` will evaluate the maximum value in the list `c`. The initial state indicates that `c` is a list of 101 integers where `c[0]` is 0, and `c[i]` represents the count of occurrences of integer `i` in the list `a`. Therefore, the maximum value in `c` will be the highest count of any integer in `a`, which can be at least 0 (for `c[0]`) and potentially higher depending on the values in `a`.

Since `n` can vary and `a` consists of integers between 1 and 100, `c` will have counts for these integers reflecting how many times each integer appears in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `c` is a list of 101 integers where `c[0]` is 0; the maximum value in `c` is the highest count of occurrences of any integer in `a`.**
