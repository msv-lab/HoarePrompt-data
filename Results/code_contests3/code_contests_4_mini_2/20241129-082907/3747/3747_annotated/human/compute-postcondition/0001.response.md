The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, raw_input().split()))`, which means it will be populated with a list of integers converted from the input string received by `raw_input()`. The previous state of `n` indicates that it is an integer within the range of 1 to 100, but the exact value of `n` isn't specified. The list `a` will contain `n` integers, each of which satisfies the condition 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100.

Since the specific integers that will be inputted to form the list `a` are not known, we can only express the state in terms of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100 based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ `a[i]` ≤ 100 based on the input.**
