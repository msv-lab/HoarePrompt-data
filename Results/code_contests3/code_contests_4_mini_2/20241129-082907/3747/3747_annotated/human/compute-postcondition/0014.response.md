The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it relies on two constraints: `n`, which is an integer in the range of 1 to 100, and `a`, which is a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer in the list satisfies the condition of being between 1 and 100. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on them. The specific output of the function is not detailed in the provided information.

Based on the given constraints and the absence of explicit output details, the functionality of the function is summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100. The exact return value is not specified.**
