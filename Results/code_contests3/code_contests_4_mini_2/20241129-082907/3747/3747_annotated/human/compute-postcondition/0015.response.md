Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (each satisfying 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 100). If `n` equals 11, it prints 5. Then, it counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a` and prints the maximum count of any integer in that range. The function does not return any value; it only prints results. **
