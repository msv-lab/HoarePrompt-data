Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issue is in the way the program handles the input and calculates the minimum number of pockets needed. 

The line `if n == 11: print(5)` is a hardcoded condition that does not relate to the problem statement and will incorrectly output `5` for any input where `n` equals `11`. This means that for any input with exactly `11` coins, the program will output a fixed number rather than calculating the correct value based on the distribution of the coins.

Furthermore, the program only prints the maximum count of any coin value, which does not correspond to the correct logic for determining the minimum number of pockets needed. The correct approach should involve counting the unique coin values and determining how many times each value occurs to find the maximum number of pockets needed to ensure that no two coins of the same value are placed in the same pocket. 

For example, for input `6` and coins `1 2 4 3 3 2`, the expected output is `2` because the two pockets can hold `[1, 2, 4]` and `[2, 3, 3]`. However, the program does not handle this correctly and will not give the expected output.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements as outlined in the problem description.
