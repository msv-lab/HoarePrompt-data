The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). If `n` is equal to 11, it prints 5. It then counts the occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 in the list `a`, and finally, it prints the maximum count of any integer in `a`. If no integers are present in `a`, it will print 0.
