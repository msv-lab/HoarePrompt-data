The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The parameter `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. After executing the function body, it produces an output based on the values in the list `a`. 

However, the output details are not provided in the prompt. Assuming the function performs a certain calculation or operation based on the input values, the specific behavior and return value would need to be specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) and returns a result based on the elements of the list `a`.**
