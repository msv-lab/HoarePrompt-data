The `print(max(c))` statement prints the maximum value from the list `c`. The list `c` contains counts of occurrences of integers in the list `a`, where indices correspond to the integers from 1 to 100. Since all indices in `c` that do not correspond to integers in `a` remain 0, the maximum value in `c` will be the highest count of occurrences of any integer present in `a`.

Assuming `c` has been properly set up based on `a`, the output state reflects the maximum count found in `c`. The exact value of `max(c)` depends on the specific contents of `a` but remains within the range defined by `c`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers; `c` is a list of integers where `max(c)` is the maximum count of occurrences of any integer in `a`**.
