The loop iterates over each integer in the list `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the list `c` by 1 for each occurrence of that integer. After all iterations of the loop are completed, `c` will reflect the count of occurrences of each integer from 1 to 100 found in the list `a`. The values in `c` will be such that `c[i]` represents how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.

If `n` is the size of list `a`, then after the loop has executed fully, `c` will contain counts for all integers in `a`, and the values of `c` at indices corresponding to any integers not present in `a` will remain 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of integers where `c[i]` represents the count of occurrences of integer `i` in the list `a` for 1 ≤ `i` ≤ 100, and all indices in `c` that do not correspond to integers in `a` remain 0.**
