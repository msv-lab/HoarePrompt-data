The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the first element of the list `a`. This means that the count at the index corresponding to the value of `d` in the list `c` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `c[d]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of integers where `c[d]` is incremented by 1, `c` is a list of 101 integers all initialized to 0**.
