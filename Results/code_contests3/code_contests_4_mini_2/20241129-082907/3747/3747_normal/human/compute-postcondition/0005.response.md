The code initializes a list `c` with 101 elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the value of `n` or the list `a`, but it establishes a new variable `c` that will hold the counts for the integers from 0 to 100. The previous values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is assigned values from `raw_input()`, satisfying 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 100; `c` is a list of 101 integers all initialized to 0.**
