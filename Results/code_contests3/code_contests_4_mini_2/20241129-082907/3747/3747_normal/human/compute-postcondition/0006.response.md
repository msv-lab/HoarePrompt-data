According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `a`. The loop will execute if the list `a` contains at least one integer, which is guaranteed by the initial state that `n` is at least 1 (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100). Therefore, `a` must have at least one element.

At the end of the loop, the variable `d` will take on the value of the first integer in the list `a` during the first iteration. As such, `d` will be equal to `a[0]`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers all initialized to 0, for the loop to execute the first time `d` is the first element of list `a`**
