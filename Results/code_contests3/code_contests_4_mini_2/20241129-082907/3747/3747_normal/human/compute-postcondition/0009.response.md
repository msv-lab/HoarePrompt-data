The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is a list of 101 integers initialized to 0, the specific index `d` will now have a value of 1, while all other indices remain 0. The values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n + 1` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented to 1**
