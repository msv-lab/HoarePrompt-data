The value of `c[d]` is incremented by 1, where `d` is the next integer in the list `a`. Since `d` is within the range of 1 to 100 (as `a` consists of integers and is initialized according to the problem constraints), `c[d]` will be increased by 1. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers, `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n + 2` integers; `c` is a list of 101 integers with `c[d]` incremented to 1.**
