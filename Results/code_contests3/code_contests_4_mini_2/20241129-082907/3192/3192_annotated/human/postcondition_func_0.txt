The function accepts input for `n` companies, each with a varying number of employees and their respective salaries. It computes the maximum salary from each company, determines the overall maximum salary across all companies, and calculates the total salary adjustment needed to equalize all companies to the maximum salary by summing the differences between the maximum and each company's maximum salary, multiplied by the number of employees in that company. Finally, it outputs this total adjustment amount. No parameters are directly accepted by the function, as it relies on user input.
