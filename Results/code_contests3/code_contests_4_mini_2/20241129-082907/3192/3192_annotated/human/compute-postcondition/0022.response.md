According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute the next time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`temp` is max(0, arr1[1]), `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr2` contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
