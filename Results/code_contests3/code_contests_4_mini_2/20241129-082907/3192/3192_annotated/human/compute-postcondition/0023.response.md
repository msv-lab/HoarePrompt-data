The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `max(temp, arr1[j])`. The value of `temp` is currently `max(0, arr1[1])`, and `arr1[j]` refers to `arr1[2]`. Since `maxval` remains unchanged and `arr2` contains `[arr1[0]]`, the values of `i` and `j` are unchanged. The output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `arr1`, we can only express `temp` in terms of its current value and `arr1[2]`. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`temp` is max(max(0, arr1[1]), arr1[2]), `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr2` contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
