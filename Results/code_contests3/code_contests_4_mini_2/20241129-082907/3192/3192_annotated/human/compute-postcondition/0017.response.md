According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Thus, the next value of `i` will be 1. Since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` now contains `temp`, `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`, `arr2` now contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] if arr1[0] > 1, otherwise temp is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.**
