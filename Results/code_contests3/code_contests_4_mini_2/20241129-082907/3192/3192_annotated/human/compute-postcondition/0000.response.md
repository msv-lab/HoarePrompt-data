`n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, but now it is specifically defined as the integer input from the user. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, assigned from input**
