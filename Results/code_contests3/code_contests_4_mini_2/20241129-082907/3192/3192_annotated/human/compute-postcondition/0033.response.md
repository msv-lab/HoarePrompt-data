According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. Currently, `temp` is 0, `maxval` has already been updated, `n` must be greater than `k + 1` for the loop to execute a second time, `i` is set to `k + 1`, and `arr1` is assigned a list of integers from input. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Also, for the first execution, `j` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`temp` is 0, `maxval` is updated, `n` is greater than `k + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 and `j` is 1**
