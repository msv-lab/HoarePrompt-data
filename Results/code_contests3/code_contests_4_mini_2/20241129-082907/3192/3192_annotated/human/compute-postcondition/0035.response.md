According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr1`. The loop index `j` starts at 1 and will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and the next value of `j` will be incremented to 2. 

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, j is 2**
