`temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input; `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input; `temp` is 0.**
