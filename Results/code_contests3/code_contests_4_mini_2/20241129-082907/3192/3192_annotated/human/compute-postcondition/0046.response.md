The statement `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` updates the value of `ans` by increasing it with the product of the difference between `maxval` and `arr[i]` and the size of the i-th input list, `arr2[i]`. The value of `i` is currently 0, so we will use `arr[0]` and `arr2[0]`. 

Assuming the previous values:
- `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr`.
- `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`.
- `arr2[i]` refers to `arr2[0]`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `ans` based on the calculation. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` input lists; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` input lists; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `ans` is updated; `i` is 0.**
