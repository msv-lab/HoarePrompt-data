According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, so for the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. Currently, `arr1` is provided as a list of integers from input, but we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is properly defined and greater than 1.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and does not directly affect the execution of the loop, the critical condition for executing the loop lies in `arr1`. 

To summarize:
- The value of `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
- The loop variable `j` will start at 1 in the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**.
