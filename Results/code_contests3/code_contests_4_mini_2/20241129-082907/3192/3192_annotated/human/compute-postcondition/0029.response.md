The variable `maxval` is assigned the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. Since `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, we don't know the exact values in `arr`, `arr1`, or `arr2`, nor do we know the prior value of `maxval`. However, we know that `i` is 1, which means that `arr[i]` refers to the second element of `arr`. The output state indicates that `maxval` may change depending on the comparison of `arr[1]` and its current value. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]; `maxval` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[1]` and its previous value.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]; `maxval` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[1]` and its previous value.**
