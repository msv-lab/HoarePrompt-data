Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` now contains `temp`; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `arr2` now contains [arr1[0]]; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 1; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
