According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr1`. The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0]` is a positive integer). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to increase by 1, which makes `j` equal to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
