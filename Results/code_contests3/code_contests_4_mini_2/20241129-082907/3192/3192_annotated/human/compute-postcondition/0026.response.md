To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the given code and the initial conditions:

1. The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j < arr1[0]`, meaning the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1.
2. During each iteration, `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Therefore, after the completion of the loop, `temp` will hold the maximum value from the elements of `arr1` starting from index 1 up to index `arr1[0] - 1`.
3. The variable `maxval` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
4. The list `arr2` retains its initial value, which contains only the first element of `arr1`. 
5. The variable `i` remains at 1, as it is not modified during the loop.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude:

- If `arr1[0]` is equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `temp` remains 0.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` will contain the maximum value found in `arr1` from index 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`.

Thus, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr2` contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1.**
