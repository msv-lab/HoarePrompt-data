According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and we need to determine if `j` is less than `arr1[0]` for the loop to execute again.

If `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, the loop can execute one more time. In that case, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. 

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`temp` is max(max(0, arr1[1]), arr1[2]), `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr2` contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1, `j` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3**
