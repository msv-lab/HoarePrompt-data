The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of the current value of `temp` (which is 0) and the value of `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we are looking at `arr1[1]`. The exact value of `arr1[1]` is unknown, but it must be greater than 1 as per the initial state. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `temp` will be the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, which will be `arr1[1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is `arr1[1]`, `j` is 1**
