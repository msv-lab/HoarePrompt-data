According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the condition set by `arr1[0]`. If `j` is less than `arr1[0]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is the maximum value between `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 3**
