According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `arr1[0]` and the current value of `j`. For the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2 and `j` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of the previous value of `temp` and `arr1[2]`; for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, `j` is 3.**
