The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its current value (`temp`, which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 1, we will consider the value of `arr1[1]`. The value of `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, which indicates that the loop condition is met, but we do not have the specific value of `arr1[1]` to perform the calculation. Therefore, `temp` is updated based on the value of `arr1[1]`, but the specific value of `temp` after this operation cannot be determined without knowing `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`**
