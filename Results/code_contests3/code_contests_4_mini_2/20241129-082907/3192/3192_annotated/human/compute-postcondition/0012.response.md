The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. The current value of `temp` is the maximum between `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`, and `j` is 3, which means we are looking at `arr1[3]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `arr1` contains positive integers.

The actual value of `arr1[3]` is unknown, so we denote it as `arr1[3]`. Therefore, `temp` could potentially be updated to either its current value or `arr1[3]`, depending on whether `arr1[3]` is greater than the current `temp`.

Since we do not have specific values for `arr1[1]`, `arr1[2]`, or `arr1[3]`, the output state reflects the possible update to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, `temp` is the maximum value between `max(temp, arr1[3])`, `j` is 3**
