Output State: **`arr1` is now a list of integers created from the input; `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1] if arr1[0] > 1, otherwise temp is 0; `maxval` is the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the previous `maxval`; `arr2` contains [arr1[0]]; `i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.**
