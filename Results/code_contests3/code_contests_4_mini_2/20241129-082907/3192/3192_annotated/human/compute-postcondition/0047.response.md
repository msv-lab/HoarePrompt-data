According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. For the loop to execute a second time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` input lists; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` input lists; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `ans` is updated; `i` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1**
