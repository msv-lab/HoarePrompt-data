The value of `temp` is appended to `arr`. Since `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, or `temp` is 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1, the state of `arr` will be updated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` now contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
