The variable `arr1` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the function `int` to the input provided through `raw_input()`, which will be split into parts. The initial state specifies that `arr` is an empty list, but `arr1` is now populated with integers based on the input. The other variables (`n`, `maxval`, `arr2`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `arr1` now contains the integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
