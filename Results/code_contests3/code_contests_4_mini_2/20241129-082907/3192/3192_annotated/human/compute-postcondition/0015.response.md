The value of `arr1[0]` is appended to `arr2`. Since `arr1[0]` is at least 1, `arr2` will have its first element as that value. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` now contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` now contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 1, and `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` now contains `temp`, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` now contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is at least 1, and `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` > 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
