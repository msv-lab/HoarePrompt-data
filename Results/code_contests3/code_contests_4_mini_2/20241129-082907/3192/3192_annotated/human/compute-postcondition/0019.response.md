The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `temp` is unspecified, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is a list of integers created from the input; `temp` is now 0; `maxval` remains unchanged; `arr2` contains [arr1[0]]; `i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers created from the input; `temp` is now 0; `maxval` remains unchanged; `arr2` contains [arr1[0]]; `i` is 1; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000.**
