According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i`, which is currently 1. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1 to allow for `i` to be 2 during the next iteration. Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` input lists; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` input lists; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr; n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `ans` is updated; `i` is 2; `ans` is increased by (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2].**
