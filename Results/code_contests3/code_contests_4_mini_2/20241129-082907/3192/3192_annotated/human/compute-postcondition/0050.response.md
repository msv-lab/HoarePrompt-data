The value of `ans` is increased by the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`. The variable `i` is 2, so we are looking at the values of `arr[2]` and `arr2[2]`. The maximum value `maxval` remains unchanged. The values of `arr` and `arr2` at index `2` affect the calculation, but the exact values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the output state reflects the updated value of `ans` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`arr` contains the maximum values from each of the `n` input lists; `arr2` contains the sizes of each of the `n` input lists; `maxval` is the maximum value among all elements in `arr; n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `i` is 2; `ans` is updated.**
