The value of `temp` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Given that `j` is 1, we need to evaluate `arr1[1]` to determine the maximum. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time, we can infer that `arr1` contains at least two values, but we do not know the specific value of `arr1[1]`. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to `max(0, arr1[1])`. The value of `maxval` remains unchanged, and `arr2` contains `[arr1[0]]`. The output state reflects the updates made to `temp`.

Output State: **`temp` is max(0, arr1[1]), `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr2` contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
