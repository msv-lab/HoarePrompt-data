The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial state indicates that `temp` is `arr1[1]`, and since `j` is currently 2, we will compare `arr1[1]` with `arr1[2]`. As the specific values of `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]` are not provided, we can only state that `temp` will take the greater of the two.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `arr` is an empty list, `maxval` is 0, `arr2` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is the maximum value between `arr1[1]` and `arr1[2]`, `j` is 2.**
