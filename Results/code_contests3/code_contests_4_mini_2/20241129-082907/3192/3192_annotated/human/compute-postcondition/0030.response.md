According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]`, and `maxval` has been updated based on the comparison of `arr[1]` with its previous value. Since the loop control variable `i` is not specified in the previous state, we can infer that it should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

So if we assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.

State: **`temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1:arr1[0]]; `maxval` is updated based on the comparison of `arr[1]` and its previous value; for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than k + 1, and `i` is k + 1.**
