According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 since the range starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `arr1[0]`. 

Currently, `i` is 1, and `temp` is 0, which are not relevant to the execution of the loop. The key state that needs to be adjusted is `arr1[0]`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` should start at 1 (the first value in the range).

State: **`temp` is 0, `maxval` remains unchanged, `arr2` contains [arr1[0]], `i` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
