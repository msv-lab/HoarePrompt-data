The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `arr` is an empty list**
