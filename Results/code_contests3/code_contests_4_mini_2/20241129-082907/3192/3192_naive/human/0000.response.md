To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and verify if it accurately computes the minimal total increase of all salaries that allows merging all companies.

### Key Observations:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of companies `n` and then iterates `n` times to read each company's employee salaries.

2. **Finding Maximum Salaries**:
   - For each company, it calculates the maximum salary and stores it in `arr`, while also storing the number of employees in `arr2`.

3. **Calculating the Increase**:
   - The program determines the overall maximum salary (`maxval`) across all companies. It then calculates the total increase needed for each company to reach this `maxval` and sums it up.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Incorrect Indexing**:
   - The line `for j in xrange(1, arr1[0])` should be `for j in xrange(1, arr1[0] + 1)` because `arr1[0]` denotes the count of employees, and salaries start from index 1. The current loop will miss the last salary.

2. **Salaries Equal to Max**:
   - If a company's maximum salary is already equal to `maxval`, the program will still calculate an increase for that company, which is incorrect. The increase should only be calculated for those companies that have a maximum salary less than `maxval`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there is only one company (`n = 1`), the total increase should be zero since no merging is needed. The current implementation will still try to calculate an increase, which is unnecessary.

### Example Case:

Consider the following input:
```
1
2 5 5
```
- Here, there is only one company, and its maximum salary is already at the maximum possible value for merging (itself). The expected output should be `0`. However, the current implementation will still attempt to calculate an increase, leading to an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:

The program does not handle certain edge cases correctly, particularly with indexing and conditions for calculating increases. Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
