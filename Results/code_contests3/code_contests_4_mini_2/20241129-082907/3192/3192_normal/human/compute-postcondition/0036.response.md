The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`, where `j` is 2. Since `arr1[1]` was used previously to update `temp`, it indicates that `arr1` has at least 3 elements. The exact value of `arr1[2]` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `temp`. The condition for the loop to execute a second time is still satisfied since `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. Therefore, the output state is: `temp` is updated based on `arr1[2]`, the loop can execute again, and `j` is 2.

Output State: **`temp` is updated based on `arr1[2]`, the loop can execute again, and `j` is 2.**
