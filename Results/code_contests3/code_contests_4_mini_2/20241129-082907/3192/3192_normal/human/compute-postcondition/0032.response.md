The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables directly, but it resets `temp` to zero. The previous state of `temp` was the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. However, that previous value is not relevant after the assignment. The other variables `arr`, `arr1`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is 0, `arr` now includes `temp`, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`temp` is 0, `arr` now includes `temp`, `arr1` is updated with the input list of integers, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and `maxval`.**
