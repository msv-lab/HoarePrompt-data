According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2. Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will become 3 and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `temp` is assigned the maximum value between its previous value and `arr1[2]`.**
