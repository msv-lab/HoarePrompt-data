According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `arr1[0] - 1`. Since `n` is within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `i` is 1, these states do not affect the ability of the loop to execute. 

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `arr1` must be a list where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1. Assuming `arr1[0]` is at least 2, then `j` will start at 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1**
