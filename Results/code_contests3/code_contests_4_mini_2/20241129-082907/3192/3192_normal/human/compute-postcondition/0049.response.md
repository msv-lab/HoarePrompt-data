According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Thus, if `i` is currently at its last value (which would be `i - 1`), we need to set `i` to `i`, incremented by 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than this new value of `i`.

State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1], `i` is currently at its last value, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than `i`**
