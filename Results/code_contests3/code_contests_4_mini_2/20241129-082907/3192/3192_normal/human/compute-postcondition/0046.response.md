To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the given initial state and the effect of the code on the variables.

1. The current value of `maxval` is known, as it is the maximum value found in `arr`.
2. The value of `arr[i]` will be taken from the `arr` list at index `i`, which is currently 0.
3. The length of the input list at index `i` is found in `arr2[i]`.
4. The expression `(maxval - arr[i])` calculates the difference between `maxval` and the first element of `arr`.
5. The result of this difference is multiplied by `arr2[i]`, which gives us the value to be added to `ans`.

After executing the statement, `ans` will be updated with the new calculated value. The previous values of `ans`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`, and `i` remain unchanged except for `ans`, which will now hold the new value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `arr` contains the maximum values from each input list, `arr2` contains the lengths of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[0]) * arr2[0]`**.
