According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` will be incremented to 3.

State: **`temp` is updated based on `arr1[2]`, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 3.**
