To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we consider the following:

1. The loop iterates `n` times, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
2. In each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated by adding the product of `(maxval - arr[i])` and `arr2[i]`.
3. After `n` iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and the loop will terminate because the range of `i` has been fully traversed.

After all iterations are complete:
- `ans` will be the cumulative sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `arr` and `arr2` will remain unchanged.
- `maxval` will remain unchanged as it is derived from `arr`.
- `n` will remain unchanged as it represents the number of iterations run.

Therefore, the output state reflects the final value of `ans` after all iterations, along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `arr` contains the maximum values from each input list, `arr2` contains the lengths of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`, `ans` is equal to the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
