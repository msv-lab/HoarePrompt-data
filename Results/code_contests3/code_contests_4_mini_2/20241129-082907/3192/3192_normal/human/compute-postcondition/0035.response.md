According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 (since it starts from 1) and `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented to 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 2**.
