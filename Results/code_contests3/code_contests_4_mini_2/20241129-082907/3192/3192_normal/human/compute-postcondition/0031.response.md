The code assigns a new value to `arr1` by reading a line of input, splitting it into components, and converting each component to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables are not directly changed by this assignment, but `arr1` now holds the list of integers from the input. Other variables (`temp`, `n`, `i`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`) remain unchanged as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; `arr1` is now updated with the input list of integers; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `arr` now includes `temp`; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]; `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and `maxval`.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; `arr1` is now updated with the input list of integers; `n` is an integer greater than 2; `i` is 2; `arr` now includes `temp`; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]; `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[i]` and `maxval`.**
