The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is initially 0 and `j` is 1, `arr1[j]` refers to the second element of `arr1`. Since `arr1` has at least one element greater than 1 and is assumed to have sufficient elements (because `n` is greater than 2), the value of `arr1[1]` will be greater than 0. Therefore, `temp` will be assigned the value of `arr1[1]` if it is greater than 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]`.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[1]**
