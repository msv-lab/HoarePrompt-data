Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` indicating the number of companies and then processes `n` lists of employee salaries. For each company, it finds the maximum salary and stores it. It then calculates the sum of the differences between the maximum salary across all companies and the maximum salary of each company multiplied by the number of employees in that company, returning this total as output. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to input validation; it assumes all inputs are valid according to the specified constraints. **
