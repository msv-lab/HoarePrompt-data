The code assigns `temp` the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. The initial value of `temp` is 0, and since the loop is set to execute when `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, we can assume `arr1[j]` is at least greater than 0. Therefore, `temp` will be updated to the maximum value found between 0 and `arr1[j]`.

Assuming `arr1[j]` is the current element being accessed in the loop, `temp` will take the value of `arr1[j]` if it is greater than the current value of `temp`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `temp`, which will now be equal to the maximum value of itself and `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[j])**
