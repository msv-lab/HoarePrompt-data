The value of `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`. Given that `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`, and `j` is currently 3, the new value of `temp` will be the greater of `temp` and `arr1[3]`. The state of `n`, `i`, and `arr1` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `arr1[3]`; `j` is 3.**
