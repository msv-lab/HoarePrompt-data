The value of `arr2` is updated by appending `arr1[0]` to it. The previous value of `arr2` is not specified, but it will now include one additional element, which is the value of `arr1[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `arr1` is a list of integers, `arr` now includes `temp`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr2` now includes its previous values plus `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value among `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, `arr1` is a list of integers, `arr` now includes `temp`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr2` now includes its previous values plus `arr1[0]**
