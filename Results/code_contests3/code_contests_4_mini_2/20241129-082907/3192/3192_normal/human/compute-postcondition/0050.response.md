The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. The variable `i` is currently at its last value and for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than `i`. This means that the loop might not execute again if `n` is not greater than `i`. The states of `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` is updated by adding `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, and the loop may not execute again as `n` is not greater than `i`.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, and the loop may not execute again as `n` is not greater than `i`.**
