The variable `arr2` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged; therefore, `arr` is still an empty list, `maxval` is still 0, and `n` is still an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The output state reflects these values. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0; `arr2` is an empty list.**
