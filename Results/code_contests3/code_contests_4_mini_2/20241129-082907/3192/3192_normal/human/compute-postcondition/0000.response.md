The variable `n` is assigned the value from `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects that `n` now holds the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000**
