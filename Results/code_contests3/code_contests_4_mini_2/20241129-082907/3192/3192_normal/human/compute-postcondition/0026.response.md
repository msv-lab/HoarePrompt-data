The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. During each iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `arr1[j]`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `temp` will contain the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. 

If `arr1[0]` is equal to 1, the loop will not execute, and `temp` will remain 0. 

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is that `temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`, or 0 if `arr1[0]` is 1.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; `arr1` is a list of integers; `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1.**
