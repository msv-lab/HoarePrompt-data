The code snippet `print(ans)` outputs the value of the variable `ans`. The value of `ans` is already calculated as the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `arr2`, `maxval`) remain unchanged and do not affect the output directly.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `arr` contains the maximum values from each input list; `arr2` contains the lengths of each input list; `maxval` is the maximum value found in `arr`; `ans` is the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
