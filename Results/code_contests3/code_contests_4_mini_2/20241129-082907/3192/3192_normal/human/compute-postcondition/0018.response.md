`arr1` is assigned a list of integers that are provided through standard input as a space-separated string, which is converted into individual integers using `map` and `list`. The variable `n` indicates the number of integers expected and is within the range of 1 to 200,000. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The output state reflects the assignment of `arr1` based on the provided input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `i` is 1, `arr1` is a list of integers from input**
