The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The previous value of `n` is not affected by this operation, as `arr` is a separate variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and the newly initialized `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `arr` is an empty list**
