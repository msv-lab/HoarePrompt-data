According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop iterates from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `arr1[0]`. Since `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again if `arr1[0]` is at least 3. Therefore, `j` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 3, for the loop to execute again `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
