To analyze the provided code snippet, we first need to understand the initial state and the effect of the line of code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
- `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0.
- `arr` is updated to include `temp`.
- `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0]`.

Now, we execute the line of code:
```
maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)
```
This line will compute the maximum value between the element at index `i` of `arr` and the current value of `maxval`. Since `i` is 0, the element at index `i` is `arr[0]`. The value of `maxval` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we will assume it has some prior value which remains unchanged in this context. 

The output state will reflect the fact that `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and its previous value. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers with at least 1 element; `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]` if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` is updated to include `temp`; `arr2` is updated to include `arr1[0] and `maxval` is updated to the maximum of `arr[0]` and its previous value.**
