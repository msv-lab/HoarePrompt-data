The expression `ans += (maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` updates the value of `ans`. To determine the output state, we consider the previous values of the affected variables, specifically `maxval`, `arr[i]`, and `arr2[i]`. Since the specific values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` are not provided, but we know that `i` is 1, we can express the output state in relation to these variables.

The variable `ans` is incremented by the product of `(maxval - arr[1])` and `arr2[1]`. Other variables are not affected, and since `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute a second time, we can conclude that `ans` will be updated based on the current values.

Output State: **`ans` is updated by adding (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]**
