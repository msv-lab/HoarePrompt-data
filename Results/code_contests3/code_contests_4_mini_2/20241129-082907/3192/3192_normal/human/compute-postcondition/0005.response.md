The variable `arr1` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input received from `raw_input()`, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers. The value of `n` is within the range of 1 to 200,000, but the specific content of the input is not known, so we cannot determine the exact values in `arr1`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 0; `arr1` is a list of integers from the input.**
