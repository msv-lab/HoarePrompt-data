The value of `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `arr1[j]`. Since `j` is 2, we are looking at `arr1[2]`. Therefore, `temp` is assigned the value `max(0, arr1[2])`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr1`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is the maximum value between 0 and `arr1[2]`; `j` is 2**
