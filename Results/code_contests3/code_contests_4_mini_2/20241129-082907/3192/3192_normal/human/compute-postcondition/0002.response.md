The variable `maxval` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, as `n` remains an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000 and `arr` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `arr` is an empty list; `maxval` is 0**
