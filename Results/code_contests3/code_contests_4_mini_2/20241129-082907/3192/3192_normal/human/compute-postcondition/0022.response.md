According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop is set to iterate starting from `j = 1` and will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 (since `arr1[0]` is specified to be greater than 1). Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.

For the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr1` is a list of integers where `arr1[0]` is greater than 2; `temp` is the maximum value between `temp` (which is 0) and `arr1[1]`; `j` is 2**
