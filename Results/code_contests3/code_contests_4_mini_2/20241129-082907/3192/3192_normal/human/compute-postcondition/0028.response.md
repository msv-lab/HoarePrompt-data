The code appends the first element of `arr1`, which is `arr1[0]`, to the list `arr2`. The variables `temp`, `n`, `i`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `arr2` with the addition of `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`temp` is the maximum value of the elements in `arr1` from index 1 to `arr1[0] - 1; `arr1` is a list of integers; `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000; `i` is 1; `arr` now includes `temp`; `arr2` includes `arr1[0]`**
