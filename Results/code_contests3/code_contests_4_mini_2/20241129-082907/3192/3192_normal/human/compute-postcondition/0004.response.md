According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, the loop can execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it represents the current index in the iteration. 

Additionally, the values of `arr`, `maxval`, and `arr2` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but they may be relevant for the loop body, which is omitted. However, based on the task requirements, we only need to focus on the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time**
