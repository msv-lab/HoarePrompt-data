The variable `temp` is assigned the maximum value between the current value of `temp` and `arr1[j]`. The value of `temp` is previously set to `max(0, arr1[1])`, and `j` is 3, so `arr1[j]` will be `arr1[3]`. The output state will reflect the new value of `temp` based on this calculation. Since we don't have specific values for `arr1`, we can't compute an exact number but we can express the relationship.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is max(max(0, arr1[1]), arr1[3]), `j` is 3**
