Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0] and we evaluate maxval as max(arr[0], maxval); `arr1` is a list of integers from input.**
