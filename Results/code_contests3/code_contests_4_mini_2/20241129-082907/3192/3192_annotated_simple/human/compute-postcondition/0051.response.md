The loop calculates the value of `ans` by summing the product of the differences between `maxval` and each element in `arr`, multiplied by the corresponding lengths in `arr2`. Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute `n` times, considering all elements in `arr` and `arr2`. After all iterations, `ans` will contain the total accumulated value based on the calculations performed during each loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` contains the maximum values from each input list, `arr2` contains the lengths of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is the sum of `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**
