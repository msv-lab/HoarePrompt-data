According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed once more, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is equal to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[1]`, `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
