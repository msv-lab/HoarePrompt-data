The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates on a specified input format that describes multiple companies and their employee salaries. The function processes a positive integer `n` (the number of companies) followed by salary data for each company. Each company has an integer `m_i` (the number of employees) followed by `m_i` positive integers representing the salaries of the employees. The constraints ensure that `n` is between 1 and 200,000 and that the total number of salaries does not exceed 200,000, with each salary being a positive integer not exceeding 1 billion.

The output is not specified in the prompt provided, so we cannot determine exact return values. However, we can infer that the function likely processes this salary data in some way related to the companies and their employees.

Functionality: **The function processes a specified input format to read the number of companies and their employee salaries, operating under constraints related to the number of companies and salaries. The exact output behavior is not detailed in the provided information.**
