To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the for loop statement. The loop will iterate over the range generated by `xrange(1, arr1[0])`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1 because `xrange(1, arr1[0])` generates values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `arr1[0]`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is initialized to 1, and `temp` is 0, we need to ensure that the state of `arr1` is such that its first element (`arr1[0]`) is greater than 1. Additionally, we need to note that `j` will start at 1 when the loop begins.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1, and `j` is 1**.
