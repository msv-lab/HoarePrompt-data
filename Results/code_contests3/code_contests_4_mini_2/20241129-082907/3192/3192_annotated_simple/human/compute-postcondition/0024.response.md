According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the first element of `arr1`, which indicates the length of the range in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `temp` is updated to max(0, arr1[1]), `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than `j`. Therefore, since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is max(0, arr1[1]), for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, `j` is 3**
