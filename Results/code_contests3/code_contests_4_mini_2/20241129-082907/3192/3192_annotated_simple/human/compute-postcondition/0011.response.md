According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the value at `arr1[0]`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is equal to the maximum of `temp` and `arr1[2]`, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3, and `j` is 3.**
