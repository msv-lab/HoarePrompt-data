The variable `temp` is appended to `arr`, which means that the value of `temp` is added as a new element at the end of the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains the new value 0 and now also contains `temp`, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains the new value 0 and now also contains `temp`, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`**.
