To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we need to consider the behavior of the loop based on the provided code and the initial state.

The loop iterates from `1` to `arr1[0] - 1`. Therefore, the total number of iterations will be `arr1[0] - 1`, which means:
- If `arr1[0]` is `1`, the loop will not execute at all.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than `1`, the loop will execute `arr1[0] - 1` times, and during each iteration, `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `arr1[j]`.

After all iterations, the value of `temp` will hold the maximum value found in the elements `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`, assuming `arr1` has enough elements. If the loop does not execute (when `arr1[0]` is `1`), `temp` will remain `0`.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:
- If `arr1[0]` is `1`, `temp` is `0`.
- If `arr1[0]` is greater than `1`, `temp` is the maximum of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1]`.

Given this reasoning, we arrive at the final output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0.**
