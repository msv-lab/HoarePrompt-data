To analyze the impact of the code, we need to look at the variable states and how they interact with each other.

1. `temp` is currently 0.
2. `arr1[j]` refers to the element at index `j` of `arr1`. However, the exact value of `arr1[j]` is not provided in the initial state. Thus, it is unknown.
3. The `max` function will compare `temp` (which is 0) with `arr1[j]`.

Since `arr1[j]` could be any value depending on `j`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `temp` without knowing `arr1[j]`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `temp` is updated to the maximum of its previous value (0) and the unknown value `arr1[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 2, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.**
