The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the result of the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `i` is currently 1. The previous value of `ans` is known. The values of `maxval`, `arr`, and `arr2` influence the calculation, but their specific values are not provided, so the output state will reflect the operation without exact numerical results. The previous values remain unchanged, and the new value of `ans` will depend on the computation involving `arr[1]` and `arr2[1]`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum values from each input list, `arr2` contains the lengths of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, and `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[1]) * arr2[1]`, `i` is 1.**
