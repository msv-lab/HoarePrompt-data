The value of `arr2` is updated by appending `arr1[0]` to it. The previous values of the affected variables are `arr1[0]`, which is a positive integer, and `arr2`, which now contains its previous elements plus the new value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0]**
