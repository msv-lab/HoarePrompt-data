The code `arr1 = list(map(int, raw_input().split()))` assigns the value to `arr1` by taking input from the user, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and storing them in a list. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected, but `arr1` now contains the user input as a list of integers. Since the values of `arr1` are unknown until user input is provided, we cannot determine specific values for `temp`, `j`, `arr`, or `maxval` at this point. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains the new value `temp`, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and `temp`.**
