`temp` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `arr1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, and `temp` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `arr1` is a list of integers from input, `temp` is 0**
