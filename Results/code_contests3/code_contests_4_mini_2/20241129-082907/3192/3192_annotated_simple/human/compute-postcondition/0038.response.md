To analyze the code snippet provided, we consider the impact of the line `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])`.

1. **Variables in the Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `arr` contains the new value 0.
   - `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`.
   - `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.
   - For the loop to execute a third time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

2. **Effect of the Code**:
   - The line `temp = max(temp, arr1[j])` updates the value of `temp` to be the maximum of its current value and `arr1[j]`.
   - Since `j` is 3, this means we are looking at `arr1[3]`.
   - The previous value of `temp` is unknown but is updated based on the value of `arr1[3]`.

3. **Output State**:
   - As the specific values of `arr1[j]` and the current `temp` are not provided, we can only describe the change.
   - The value of `temp` will be the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`.
   - Other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: `temp` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`, while all other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`temp` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `arr1[3]`; `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.**
