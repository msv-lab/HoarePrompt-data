The value of `temp` is explicitly assigned to 0. The previous values of `n`, `i`, and other variables are unaffected by this assignment. The only change in the state is the value of `temp`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0; `arr` still contains the previous value of `temp`, and `arr2` still contains `arr1[0]` while `maxval` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is 0; `arr` still contains the previous value of `temp`, `arr2` still contains `arr1[0]`, `maxval` remains unchanged.**
