Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of companies. For each company, it reads a list of salaries and calculates the maximum salary in each list. It then determines the overall maximum salary across all companies and computes a total `ans`, which is the sum of the differences between this maximum salary and the maximum salary for each company, multiplied by the number of salaries in that company. Finally, it prints the computed total `ans`. The function does not handle cases where there are no companies or salaries, as it assumes `n` will always be at least 1. **
