The line of code `maxval = max(arr[i], maxval)` assigns `maxval` the maximum value between `arr[i]` and the current value of `maxval`. Given the initial state, we know that `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, and `arr` now contains the new value `temp`. 

The previous value of `maxval` is `temp`, as it was assigned the maximum value from the specified range of `arr1`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`. 

Since `maxval` is updated to the maximum between `arr[1]` and `temp`, the output state must reflect that `maxval` is now the maximum of these two values, but we cannot determine the exact new value of `maxval` without knowing `arr[1]`. 

Thus, the output state will indicate the relationship without providing a specific numerical value for `maxval`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains the new value `temp`, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and `temp`.**
