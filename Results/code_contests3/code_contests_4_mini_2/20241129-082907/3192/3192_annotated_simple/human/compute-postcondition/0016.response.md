The code assigns the maximum value between `arr[i]` and `maxval` to `maxval`. The value of `i` is currently 0, so `arr[i]` refers to `arr[0]`. We need to verify the value of `maxval` before this line of code is executed. Since `maxval` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0] and we evaluate maxval as max(arr[0], maxval).**
