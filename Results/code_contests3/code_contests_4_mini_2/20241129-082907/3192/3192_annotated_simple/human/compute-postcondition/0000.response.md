The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(raw_input())`, where `raw_input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). Since the input will determine the exact value of `n`, the output state reflects that `n` is now a specific positive integer based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input**
