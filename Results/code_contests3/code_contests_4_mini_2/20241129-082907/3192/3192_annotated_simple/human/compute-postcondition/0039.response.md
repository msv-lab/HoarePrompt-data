The loop iterates over the elements of `arr1` starting from index 1 up to `arr1[0] - 1`, updating `temp` to be the maximum of its current value and the elements of `arr1`. After all iterations, `temp` will contain the maximum value found in the range of `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr1` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0] - 1`, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.**
