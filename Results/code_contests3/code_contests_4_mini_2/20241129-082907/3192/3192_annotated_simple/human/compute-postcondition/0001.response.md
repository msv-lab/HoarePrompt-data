The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The variable `n`, which is a positive integer based on user input, is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `n` and the new value of `arr`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `arr` is an empty list.**
