According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `arr1[0]`. Given that `n` is a positive integer, `i` is initialized to 0, and `temp` is 0, these values do not directly impact the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to be executed at least once, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1. If this condition is met, the iteration variable `j` will start at 1. Thus, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and initially, `j` will be 1 during the first execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `temp` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
