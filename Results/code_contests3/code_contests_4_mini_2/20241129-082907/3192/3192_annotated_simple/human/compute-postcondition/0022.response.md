According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `arr1`, specifically the value `arr1[0]`. The loop starts at `j = 1` and continues while `j` is less than `arr1[0]`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2. For the loop to execute a second time, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is max(0, arr1[1]), `j` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2**
