According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the positive integer `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value from `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0]-1] if arr1[0] > 1`, otherwise `temp` is 0; `arr` now contains `temp`; `arr2` now contains `arr1[0] and we evaluate maxval as max(arr[0], maxval).**
