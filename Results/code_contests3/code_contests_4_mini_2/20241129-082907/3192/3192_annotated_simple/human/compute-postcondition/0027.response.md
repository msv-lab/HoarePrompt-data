The code `arr.append(temp)` adds the value of `temp` to the list `arr`. The variable `temp` holds the maximum value from the specified range in `arr1`, which is defined as the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`. The variable `arr` is affected by this operation as it now includes the new value of `temp`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, and `arr` now contains the new value `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` now contains the new value `temp`**.
