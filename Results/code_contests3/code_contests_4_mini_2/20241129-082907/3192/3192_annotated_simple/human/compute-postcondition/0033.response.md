According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute if `arr1[0]` is greater than 1, since `xrange(1, arr1[0])` generates a range from 1 to `arr1[0] - 1`. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]`, and `arr` contains the new value 0, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Since `j` is currently set to `arr1[0]`, we should adjust `j` to start at 1 for the first iteration of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `arr1[0]` is greater than 1 and that `j` is initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`, for the loop to execute `arr1[0]` must be greater than 1**
