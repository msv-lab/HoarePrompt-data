According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the upper limit defined by `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `arr1[0]` is a positive integer greater than 1, meaning it is at least 2. Therefore, the loop can execute again for the next value of `j`, which will be 2.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2, and the loop can continue as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. Thus, if `arr1[0]` is greater than 2, the loop will run for `j` equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is 2, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`, and `temp` is updated to the maximum of `0` and `arr1[1]` for the loop to execute a second time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 2.**
