According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.

Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the condition of the loop. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the states need to be updated as follows:

- `i` will be 2.
- The condition for `n` is that it must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains the new value `temp`, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and `temp`.**
