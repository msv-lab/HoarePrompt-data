The variable `temp` is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `temp` was the maximum value in `arr1[1]` to `arr1[arr1[0] - 1]`, but after this assignment, `temp` is now `0`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, `arr2`, and `maxval`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is 0, `j` is `arr1[0]`, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, and `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`.**
