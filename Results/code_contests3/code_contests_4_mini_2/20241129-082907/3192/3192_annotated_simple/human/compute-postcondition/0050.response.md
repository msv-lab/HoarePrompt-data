The variable `ans` is updated with the expression `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression evaluates to `(maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`. The values of `maxval`, `arr[2]`, and `arr2[2]` will determine how `ans` is updated. Other variables, like `n`, `arr`, and `arr2`, remain unchanged.

Since `n` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again, and `ans` will be updated accordingly. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `arr` contains the maximum values from each input list, `arr2` contains the lengths of each input list, `maxval` is the maximum value from all elements in `arr`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (maxval - arr[2]) * arr2[2]`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 2.**
