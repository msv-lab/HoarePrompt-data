According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `arr1[0]`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `arr1[0]`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2 and `arr1[0]` is greater than 2 (since `n` is a positive integer greater than 1). For the loop to execute a third time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. Therefore, `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `arr1[j]`, `j` is 3, `arr` contains the new value 0, `arr2` includes the value `arr1[0]`, `maxval` is the maximum of `arr[1]` and the previous value of `temp`, for the loop to execute a third time `arr1[0]` must be greater than 3.**
