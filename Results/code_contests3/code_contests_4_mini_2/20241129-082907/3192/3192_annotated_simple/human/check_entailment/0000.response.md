To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its functionality in relation to the problem description.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
The problem requires merging several companies into one by ensuring that the maximum salaries in the companies are equal. The owners can only increase salaries (and must increase them uniformly across each company) to achieve this. The goal is to minimize the total increase across all companies to allow for the merges.

### Breakdown of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:** 
   - The first integer `n` captures the number of companies.
   - For each company, it reads in the number of employees followed by their respective salaries.

2. **Finding Maximum Salaries:**
   - It keeps track of the maximum salary for each company in the `arr` list.
   - It also maintains the total number of employees for each company in `arr2`.

3. **Calculating the Total Increase:**
   - The program calculates the maximum salary across all companies (`maxval`).
   - For each company, it computes the total increase needed to raise all salaries to `maxval`. This is done by summing `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]`, where `arr[i]` is the maximum salary of the i-th company, and `arr2[i]` is the number of employees in that company. 

4. **Output:** 
   - Finally, it prints the computed total increase.

### Verification of Correctness:
1. **Merging Condition:** 
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum salary across all companies and ensures that all companies are raised to that maximum level before merging.

2. **Uniform Increase:** 
   - The logic `(maxval - arr[i]) * arr2[i]` ensures that every employee in a company gets the same increase in salary. 

3. **Minimization of Increase:**
   - By setting all salaries to the overall maximum salary, it minimizes the total increase required for all companies to be able to merge.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as per the description provided. It ensures that salaries are raised uniformly and calculates the minimum total increase necessary for merging all companies.

Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
