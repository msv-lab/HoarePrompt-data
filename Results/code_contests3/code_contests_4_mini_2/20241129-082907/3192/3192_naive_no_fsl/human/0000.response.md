Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimal total increase of salaries to allow for merging all companies into one. 

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Salary Calculation**: The program calculates the total increase based on the maximum salary found among all companies (`maxval`). However, the requirement is to ensure that all companies have equal maximum salaries before merging, which may not be achieved by simply increasing all companies to the highest maximum salary.

2. **Merging Logic**: The problem description allows for merging two companies at a time, and the program does not account for the step-by-step merging process or the possibility of needing different increases for different companies depending on their maximum salaries.

3. **Example Case Failure**: 
   - Consider an input where there are three companies with the following salaries:
     ```
     3
     2 4 3
     2 2 1
     3 1 1 1
     ```
     The expected output, as per the problem statement, is `13`. The program computes the maximum salary as `4` and then calculates the total increase simply based on that maximum without considering the specific needs for merging. 

   - Specifically:
     - For the second company, to reach `4`, it requires an increase of `2` for both employees (`2 * 2 = 4`).
     - For the third company, it requires an increase of `3` for all three employees to reach `4` (`3 * 3 = 9`).
     - The total calculated in the program would add up to `4 (from company 2) + 9 (from company 3) = 13`.
     - However, the program does not handle the merging correctly, as it does not take into account the order of merges and the intermediate steps necessary to ensure all companies can be merged under the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
Because the program does not correctly follow the problem requirements in every potential case, the output is `False`. The merging logic and salary adjustment calculations need refinement to ensure correct results across all possible input scenarios.
