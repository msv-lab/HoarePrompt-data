To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

The problem states that we need to check if string `S` is equal to string `T` after performing some number of rotations. The rotation operation involves moving the last character of the string to the front.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `raw_input()` to read the two strings `s` and `t`. Note that `raw_input()` is used in Python 2. If this code is run in Python 3, it should be replaced with `input()`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks for any rotation of `t` that matches `s`. It does so by creating a new string formed by slicing `t` at every index `i` and concatenating the two parts (`t[i:] + t[:i]`).
   - It uses a generator expression with `any()` to check if any rotation of `t` equals `s`. If any rotation matches, it evaluates to `True`; otherwise, it evaluates to `False`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'Yes' if a rotation matches and 'No' otherwise.

### Edge Cases:

- The program must handle cases where `S` and `T` are of the minimum length of 2 (e.g., `S = "ab"` and `T = "ba"` should return "Yes").
- It also needs to ensure that if `S` and `T` are identical, it should return "Yes".
- The program should correctly handle cases where `T` consists of the same letter repeated (e.g., `S = "aaaa"` and `T = "aaaa"` should return "Yes").

### Testing with potential edge cases:

1. **Matching Strings**: 
   - Input: `s = "abc"`, `t = "abc"` should output "Yes".
   
2. **Single Rotation**: 
   - Input: `s = "abc"`, `t = "cab"` should output "Yes".
   
3. **Different Characters**: 
   - Input: `s = "abc"`, `t = "def"` should output "No".

4. **Minimum Length**: 
   - Input: `s = "ab"`, `t = "ba"` should output "Yes".

5. **Same Characters**: 
   - Input: `s = "aaaa"`, `t = "aaaa"` should output "Yes".

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the logic, the program correctly checks all the specified conditions and adheres to the problem description. There are no apparent cases where the program fails to handle any potential input correctly. 

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**
