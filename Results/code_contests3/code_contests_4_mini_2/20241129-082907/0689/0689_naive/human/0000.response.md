To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program checks for string rotations.

The problem describes that we need to determine if string S equals string T after performing a specified rotation operation. The rotation operation essentially moves the last character of the string to the front.

The provided program reads two strings, S and T, and checks if T can be rotated to match S. The specific line of interest is:

```python
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

This line checks all possible rotations of T (by slicing T in different ways) and compares each rotation with S. If any rotation of T matches S, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Let's consider the constraints and edge cases:

1. Both strings S and T have the same length and consist of lowercase English letters, as required by the problem.
2. The program iterates through all possible rotations of T (from index 0 to len(T)-1) and checks if any of these match S.

Now, we will check if there are any potential cases where this program might not give the expected result:

- The program correctly handles the situation for any string length due to the range used in the for loop and the slicing operation.
- The program correctly accounts for strings that are already equal or have repeated characters.

However, an important point to note is that the method of checking rotations by concatenating parts of T (i.e., `t[i:] + t[:i]`) is valid, but the syntax of `print['No', 'Yes']` should be corrected to `print(['No', 'Yes'][...])` for proper function. This might lead to a runtime error if executed in a Python environment, as it will raise a `TypeError`.

Given that the program has a potential for a runtime error due to incorrect print syntax, it fails to meet the problem description's requirement to produce valid output.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program contains a syntax error in the print statement, which prevents it from functioning correctly as per the problem description.
