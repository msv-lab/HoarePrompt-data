Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `s` and `t` of equal length consisting of lowercase English letters. It checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t` any number of times. If `s` is a rotation of `t`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not explicitly return any value, only prints the result. **
