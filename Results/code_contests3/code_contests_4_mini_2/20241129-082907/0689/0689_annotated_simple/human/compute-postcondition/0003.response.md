The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, with lengths between 2 and 100, and |S| = |T|. The functionality of the function is to compare the two strings and determine if they are permutations of each other. If they are permutations, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters S and T, both of equal length and consisting of lowercase English letters, and returns `True` if S and T are permutations of each other; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
