To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state of the variables.

The code is checking if the string `s` can be formed by any rotation of the string `t`. It does this by concatenating `t` with itself in a rotated manner (`t[i:] + t[:i]`) and checking if it equals `s` for any `i` in the range of the length of `t`.

Given the initial state where `S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters, and `s` and `t` are input strings, the program will evaluate the condition:

- If any of the rotations of `t` (i.e., `t[i:] + t[:i]` for each index `i`) equals `s`, it will output 'Yes'.
- If none of the rotations match `s`, it will output 'No'.

However, without specific values of `s` and `t`, we cannot determine the exact output of the print statement. Thus, we can only conclude that the output will depend on the values of `s` and `t`.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings consisting of lowercase English letters; the output is either 'Yes' or 'No' depending on if any rotation of `t` matches `s`.**
