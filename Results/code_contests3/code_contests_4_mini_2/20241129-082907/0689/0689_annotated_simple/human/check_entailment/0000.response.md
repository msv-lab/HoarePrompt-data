Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description for the following reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `raw_input()` which is valid in Python 2 but not in Python 3. In Python 3, this should be replaced with `input()`. This would lead to a runtime error if executed in a Python 3 environment.

2. **Output Format**: The problem description specifies that the output should be `Yes` or `No`, while the program outputs the equivalent of `No` and `Yes` but does so using an index lookup in a list (`print['No', 'Yes'][...]`). This is not the correct syntax for the `print` function in Python, and it does not match the output format exactly as required.

3. **Logic of Rotation Check**: The logic for checking if `S` equals `T` after rotation is correct. The expression `any(t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t)))` effectively checks every possible rotation of `T` to see if it matches `S`. However, if any of the above issues cause the program to fail before reaching this logic, it renders the solution incorrect.

4. **Edge Cases**: As the input constraints guarantee that both strings are of equal length and consist of lowercase letters, the logic would handle various cases correctly if the input and output formats were handled correctly.

Overall, the program fails to comply with the expected functionality and output format as outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it does not fulfill the requirements correctly.
