To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to evaluate its adherence to the problem description and analyze any potential edge cases.

**Problem description**: The task is to determine if string `S` equals string `T` after performing a rotation operation on `T`. The operation involves moving the last character of `T` to the front, which can be repeated any number of times.

**Program**:
```python
s = raw_input()
t = raw_input()
print['No', 'Yes'][any((t[i:] + t[:i] == s for i in range(len(t))))]
```

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The program reads two strings, `s` and `t`.
   - It uses a generator expression to check if any rotation of `t` equals `s`. For each index `i`, it checks if the string formed by taking the substring from `i` to the end and concatenating it with the substring from the beginning to `i` equals `s`.
   - If any rotation matches, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

2. **Edge Cases**: 
   - An edge case to consider is when both strings are very similar but not rotations of each other, like `s = "abc"` and `t = "acb"`. The expected output should be 'No', and the code handles this correctly.
   - Another edge case is when `s` and `t` consist of the same character repeated, for example, `s = "aaaa"` and `t = "aaaa"`. The expected output should be 'Yes', which is also handled correctly.
   - However, a potential edge case is with strings of length 2, such as `s = "ab"` and `t = "ba"`, which should return 'Yes'. The code does handle this correctly as well.

3. **Output hints**: The output hints state that the function checks if `s` can be obtained by rotating `t`, and it accurately describes the functionality of the code.

4. **Final Review**: 
   - The code correctly checks all possible rotations of `t` to determine if it matches `s`.
   - The output hints align with the logic of the code, confirming its correctness.
   - Given that the program is tested against the problem description and output hints, there are no cases where the program fails.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality as described.

Correctness: **True**.
