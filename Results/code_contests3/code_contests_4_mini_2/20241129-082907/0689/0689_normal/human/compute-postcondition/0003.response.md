The function `func` accepts two parameters, `S` and `T`. Both `S` and `T` are strings composed of lowercase English letters, and their lengths are equal, ranging from 2 to 100 characters. After executing the function body, the function processes these two strings and provides a specific output based on their contents. However, the exact conditions determining the output are not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two equal-length strings `S` and `T` and return a result based on the comparison or relationship between these strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters S and T, both strings of lowercase English letters of equal length, and returns a result based on the relationship between S and T.**
