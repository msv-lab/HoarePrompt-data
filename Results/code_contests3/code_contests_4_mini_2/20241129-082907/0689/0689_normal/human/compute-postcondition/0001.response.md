`t` is assigned the value of `raw_input()`, which accepts an input string from the user. The initial state does not specify the value of `s`, but it indicates that `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with equal lengths. The values of `S` and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100; `s` is an input string; `t` is an input string.

Output State: **`S` and `T` are strings of lowercase English letters with lengths between 2 and 100; `s` is an input string; `t` is an input string.**
