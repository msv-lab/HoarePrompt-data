#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) / sin(π / (2 * n)) for the odd integer n between 3 and 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range 3 to 199 (inclusive) and returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)). It does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or if `n` is an even number, which could lead to incorrect inputs being processed without any error handling.
