Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range 3 to 199 (inclusive) and returns the value of cos(π / (4 * n)) divided by sin(π / (2 * n)). It does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range or if `n` is an even number, which could lead to incorrect inputs being processed without any error handling. **
