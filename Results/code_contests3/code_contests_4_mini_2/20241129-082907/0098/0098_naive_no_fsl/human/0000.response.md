To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

### Problem Description:
1. We need to compute the minimum side length of a square that can fully embed a convex polygon with `2n` vertices, where `n` is an odd integer.
2. The polygon is a regular `2n`-gon with each side of length 1.
3. The output should be formatted to a precision of 9 decimal places.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program defines a function `func_1(n)` which computes a value based on the formula:
```python
math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```
This function is then called for each test case, where `n` is read from the input. The output is formatted to 9 decimal places.

### Mathematical Analysis:
The formula used in `func_1(n)` is derived from geometric properties of the `2n`-gon. Specifically:
- The angle subtended by each side at the center is `2π/(2n) = π/n`.
- The side length of the inscribed square can be calculated in relation to the radius of the circumscribed circle.

Given that the program is correctly computing the side length required to embed the `2n`-gon in a square based on the given formula and is outputting it in the required format, we need to ensure:
1. It handles all odd integers within the specified range correctly.
2. It does not produce any errors or unexpected outputs for valid inputs.

### Edge Cases:
- The program should handle the minimum value of `n`, which is 3.
- It should also handle the maximum value of `n`, which is 199.
- Additionally, since the input constraint guarantees that `n` will always be odd and within the specified bounds, we do not need to check for invalid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Since the formula used appears to be correct for computing the side length of the square that can embed a `2n`-gon and the program handles input and output correctly, there are no identified edge cases where it would fail.

Therefore, I conclude that the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
