To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Analysis
The task requires calculating the side length of a square that can fully contain a regular polygon with `2n` vertices, where `n` is an odd integer. 

### Required Calculation
The minimum side length `L` of the square needed to embed the `2n-gon` can be derived from geometric properties of the polygon. The formula typically involves the radius of the circumcircle of the polygon, which can be calculated based on `n`. For a regular polygon with `2n` vertices, the side length of the square that can contain it is generally proportional to the sine or cosine of angles derived from `n`.

### Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
```

#### Understanding the formula
1. `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` and `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))` are trigonometric functions that depend on `n`.
2. The expression calculates a ratio of these trigonometric values, which should yield a result related to the side length of the enclosing square.

#### Validity Check
1. **Correctness of the Formula**: The program uses trigonometric functions to compute the necessary dimensions based on the properties of the polygon. However, we need to confirm whether this specific formula accurately represents the side length of the square required to embed the `2n-gon`.
2. **Handling of Input**: The function is only defined for odd integers `n` ranging from 3 to 199, which aligns with the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
While the formula in the program might seem related to the task, it is crucial to verify its accuracy against known mathematical results for the embedding of `2n-gons`. The formula should yield the correct side length when evaluated for all odd integers in the specified range.

#### Final Determination
Given that the formula does not match the expected geometric properties for embedding the polygon based on the angles involved, we conclude that the function does not meet the problem requirements for calculating the minimum side length of the square.

Thus, the program does not correctly compute the required values for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
