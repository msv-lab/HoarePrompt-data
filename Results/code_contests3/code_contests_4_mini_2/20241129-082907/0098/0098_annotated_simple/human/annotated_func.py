#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the result of the expression math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is an odd integer between 3 and 199.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range from 3 to 199 and returns the result of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. It does not handle cases where `n` might be outside the specified range, and it assumes that `n` will always be a valid odd integer within that range. If `n` is invalid, the behavior is not defined in the code.
