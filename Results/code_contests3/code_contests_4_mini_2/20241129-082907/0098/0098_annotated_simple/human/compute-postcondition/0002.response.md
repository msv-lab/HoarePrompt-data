Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range from 3 to 199 and returns the result of the expression `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. It does not handle cases where `n` might be outside the specified range, and it assumes that `n` will always be a valid odd integer within that range. If `n` is invalid, the behavior is not defined in the code.**
