#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199.
def func_1(n):
    return math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) / math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))
    #The program returns the value of math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n)) divided by math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n)), where n is an odd integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 199
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199, and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional checks for edge cases or error handling for invalid inputs outside the specified range, which may lead to undefined behavior if `n` is not an odd integer or is outside the range of 3 to 199.
