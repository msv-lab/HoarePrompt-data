Functionality: ** The function accepts an odd integer `n` in the range of 3 to 199, and returns the value of `math.cos(math.pi / (4 * n))` divided by `math.sin(math.pi / (2 * n))`. There are no additional checks for edge cases or error handling for invalid inputs outside the specified range, which may lead to undefined behavior if `n` is not an odd integer or is outside the range of 3 to 199. **
