The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variable `mod` is 100000, so the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is taken modulo 100000. 

The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not specified in terms of specific values, but the operation is performed on the corresponding `dp` array elements. The other variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `mod` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state reflects that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the modulo operation.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % 100000.**
