The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The specific value of `i` is 2, and the value of `j` is 1, while `k` is at least 1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which equals `1` (since 3 in binary is `11` and 1 is `01`, their bitwise AND gives `01`). Thus, both the left and right sides of the assignment refer to `dp[1][2][k]` (where `j + 1` is 2). The previous values of `j` and `k` are utilized without change. Therefore, the Output State remains unaffected except for the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k` (1); `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][k]`.**
