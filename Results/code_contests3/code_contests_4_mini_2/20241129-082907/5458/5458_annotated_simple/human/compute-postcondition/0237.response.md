The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `k` is less than `S`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
