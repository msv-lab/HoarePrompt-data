The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index [1][4][1]; `m` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
