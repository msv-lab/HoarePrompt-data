Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1, with `m` being at least 3, `j` equal to 3, `s` at least 1, and `k` equal to 1. Otherwise, `dp[1][4][1]` is updated based on the value of `dp[0][3][-2] % mod.***
