According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since the range is from 1 to `s + 1`. The initial state indicates that `s` is at least 1, so the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `k` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration. Therefore, the states that need to be noted for the loop to execute are that `k` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions throughout all iterations**
