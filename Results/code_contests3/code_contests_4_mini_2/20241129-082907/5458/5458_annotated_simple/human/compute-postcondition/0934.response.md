Functionality: ** The function reads multiple datasets consisting of three positive integers (N, M, S) until it encounters the line "0 0 0". For each dataset, it calculates a value based on a dynamic programming approach and prints the result. The function handles datasets with constraints on N (1 to 7), M (1 to 2000), and S (1 to 3000), and it outputs the computed value modulo 100000 for each dataset. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
