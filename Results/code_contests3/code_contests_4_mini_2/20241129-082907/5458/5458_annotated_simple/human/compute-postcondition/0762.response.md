According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, and `m` is at least 1. Since the loop starts with `j` at 1 and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to 2, and the value of `m` must be at least 2 to allow `j` to be less than or equal to `m`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is updated based on the conditions throughout all iterations.**
