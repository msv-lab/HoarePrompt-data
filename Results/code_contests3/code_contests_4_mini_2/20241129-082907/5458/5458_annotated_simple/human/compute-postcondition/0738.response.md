The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k` (1), and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement.
