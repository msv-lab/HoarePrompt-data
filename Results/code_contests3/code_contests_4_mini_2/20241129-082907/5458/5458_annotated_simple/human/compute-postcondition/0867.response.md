The code assigns the value `1` to the element at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the `dp` array. Given that `i` is `0`, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The value of `j` is at least `2`, thus `j + 1` is at least `3`. The value of `k` is `1`. Therefore, the assignment occurs at `dp[1][j + 1][1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is now 1, `dp` is updated at dp[1][j + 1][1] = 1.**
