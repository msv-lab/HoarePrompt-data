The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and continue with the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a list of lists fully updated, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than `k`; `dp[1 + 1 & 1][m + 1 + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1 + 1 & 1][m + 1][1]`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
