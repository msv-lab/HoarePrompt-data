According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1. Thus, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 2 to ensure that `k` (which is now 2) is still within the bounds defined by `s`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the `dp` array is updated accordingly.**
