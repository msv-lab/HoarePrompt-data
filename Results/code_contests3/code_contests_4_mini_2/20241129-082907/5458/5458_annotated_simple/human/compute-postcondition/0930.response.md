Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, `dp` is updated based on the conditions throughout all iterations, `i` is `n^2 - 1`, `j` is `m + 1`, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp` reflects the results of the calculations performed in the nested loops for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`.**
