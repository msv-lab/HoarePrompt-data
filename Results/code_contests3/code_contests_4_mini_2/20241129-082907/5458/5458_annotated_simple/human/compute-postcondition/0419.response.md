According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute for the second time, `j` must reach 2, which means that `m` must be at least 2. The loop starts with `j` initialized to 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration. Since the current state indicates `i` is 2, this implies the loop has already executed once and `j` is currently 2. 

Thus, we need to ensure the conditions for `m` are met for the loop to execute again. 

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp` has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is currently 2 for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.414**
