The statement assigns the value `1` to the specific position in the `dp` array. The position is determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but `k` is 1, and `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`. The values of `N`, `M`, and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, and `dp` at the index `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to 1.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][1]` is updated to 1.**
