The `continue` statement is used to skip the remaining code inside the current loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we skip to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
