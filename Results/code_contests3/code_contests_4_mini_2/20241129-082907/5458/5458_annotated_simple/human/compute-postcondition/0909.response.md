Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s`; `j` is either 1 or 2; and `i` is equal to 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
