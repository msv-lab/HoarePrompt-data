The line of code attempts to assign a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. 

Given the initial state, `dp` is `[[0], [0]]`, and since `k` is 2, it must be noted that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will raise an error because the list `dp` does not have a third dimension with index `k`. 

Therefore, since the assignment cannot be performed due to the out-of-bounds index, the output state will reflect that no changes occurred in `dp`.

Output State: **`dp` remains [[0], [0]]; assignment cannot be performed due to index out of bounds.**
