According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper bound `M`. The loop is set to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least `2 + the number of iterations executed`, and `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be less than or equal to `M`. If `j` is at least 2 plus the number of iterations executed, we can denote this as `j` being at least 2. If the loop has executed `k` times, then `j` is at least `2 + k`. 

Assuming the loop executed `k` times, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so it will be at least `3 + k`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `M` must be at least `3 + k`.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `dp` contains updated values based on the loop's logic after all iterations, `i` is 1 or 0, and `j` is at least 3 + the number of iterations executed.**
