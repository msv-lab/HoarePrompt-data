According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `S`. The loop will execute for the next value of `k` as long as `k` is less than or equal to `S`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and `S` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, which means `k` will become 3. 

For the loop to execute again, `S` must be at least 3, so that `k` (which will be 3) is less than or equal to `S`. 

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
