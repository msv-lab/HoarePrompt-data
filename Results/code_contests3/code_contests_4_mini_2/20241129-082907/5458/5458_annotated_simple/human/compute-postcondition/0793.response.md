Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is either 2 or 3, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3; if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0 and `j` is 3, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
