The code `continue` does not change any variable values but skips the current iteration of the loop in which it is placed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is equal to 0; and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we skip the current iteration of the loop.
