According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1 since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `s + 1`. The current state indicates that `k` is already set to `s`, which is appropriate for the loop's first execution. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1 and `k` should be initialized to 1 for the loop to run the first time.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, `m` is at least 3, `i` is equal to 2, `j` is equal to 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time.**
