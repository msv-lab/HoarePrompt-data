The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns a value from one index of the list of lists `dp` to another index. 

- The value of `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. The expression `1 & 1` yields 1, meaning we are accessing `dp[1][...]`.
- The value of `j` is `m + 1`, so `j + 1` becomes `m + 2`. We are accessing `dp[1][m + 2][k]`.
- The value of `k` is 3, which remains unaffected in this assignment.

Thus, the expression is effectively copying the value from `dp[1][m + 1][3]` to `dp[1][m + 2][3]`. 

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indexes [1][m + 2][3] with the value from [1][m + 1][3]; `j` remains `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `k` is 3.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indexes [1][m + 2][3] with the value from [1][m + 1][3]; `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `k` is 3.**
