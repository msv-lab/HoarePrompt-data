Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists that is fully updated; if `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped; since `k` is equal to `s`, the loop will not execute a second time; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
