According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Given the initial state, `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is a positive integer between 1 and 3000, `mod` is 100000, `dp` is a 2 x (`M` + 2) list of lists initialized with zeros, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. The important variable here is `S`, which should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `dp` is a 2 x (`M` + 2) list of lists initialized with zeros, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
