According to the code, the loop will execute based on the variable `k`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `s`. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `k` must be less than `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `s` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
