The code assigns the value `1` to the 3D list `dp` at the indices `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`, and since `&` is a bitwise operator, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. Therefore, the index for the first dimension becomes `1`. The second index, `j + 1`, evaluates to `2` (since `j` is `1`), and the third index remains `k`. Hence, the assignment becomes:

`dp[1][2][k] = 1`.

No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `dp[1][2][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
