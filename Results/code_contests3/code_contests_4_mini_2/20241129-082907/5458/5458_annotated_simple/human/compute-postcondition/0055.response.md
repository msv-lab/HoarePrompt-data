According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop executes for values of `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` would have taken a value of `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`. 

Since `s` is at least 1, the next value of `k` will be `s + 1`, which is 2 or more depending on the value of `s`. Thus, to execute the loop one more time, `k` must be greater than `s`.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be greater than `s`, and `k` is `s + 1`.**
