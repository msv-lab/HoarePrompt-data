The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are referenced in the indexing. The value of `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is `M + 1`, and `k` is equal to `S`. 

Since `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, and given that `j` is greater than `k`, the state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will now hold the value that was previously in `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `M`, `S`, and the contents of `dp` are not detailed, but the assignment occurs without altering the values of `N`, `M`, `S`, or the dimensions of `dp`. 

Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables and acknowledges the assignment in the `dp` structure.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is equal to `S`, `j` is `M + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`.**
