According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop is set to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `k` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must remain at least 3 and `k` must be 3.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, with `m` at least 2, `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `s` at least 3, and `k` equal to 3.**
