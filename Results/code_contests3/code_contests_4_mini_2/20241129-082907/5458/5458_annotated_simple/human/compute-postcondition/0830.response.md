According to the code, the loop is defined to iterate over `j` from 1 to `m + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the variable `m` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied as stated (`m` is at least 1). The variable `j` starts at 1, so it is also ready for the first iteration.

The initial value of `j` is already set to at least `m + 1`, which indicates that it is greater than 1, but the loop starts from 1. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to 1 to allow the loop to execute for the first time.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1 (for the loop to execute the first time), `s` is at least 1, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is fully updated based on the conditions specified in the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`.**
