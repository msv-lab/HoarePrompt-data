In this code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` is 3. The operation `i + 1 & 1` affects the indexing based on the value of `i`, which is not explicitly stated in the initial state. 

However, since we don't have values for `i` and `j`, we cannot determine the exact values of the indices. The other variables `N`, `M`, `S`, and `mod` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the assignment operation without specifying the exact values of the indices.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 3, `mod` is 100000, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
