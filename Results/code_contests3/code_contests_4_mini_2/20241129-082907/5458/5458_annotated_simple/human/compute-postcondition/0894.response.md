Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and `k` is 2. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the calculation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` and the previous values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`.***
