The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `i` is 2, so `i + 1` becomes 3. The binary operation `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `3 & 1`, which results in 1 (since 3 in binary is `11` and 1 is `01`, and the bitwise AND gives `01`).

Thus, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod`. The variable `j` is greater than `k`, and since `k` is 1, `j + 1` will be greater than 2.

The output state reflects that `dp[1][j + 1][k]` now holds the value of `dp[1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is equal to `dp[1][j][k] % mod`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 1.**
