The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not explicitly mentioned, but we know that `k` is at least 2 and must be less than or equal to `s`, indicating that the assignment is valid. 

The output state does not provide specific values for `i`, `j`, or `s`, but it confirms the assignment made in the `dp` structure. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and the assignment has occurred in the dp array.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, the assignment has occurred in the dp array.**
