Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `k` is equal to `S`, `j` is `M + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
