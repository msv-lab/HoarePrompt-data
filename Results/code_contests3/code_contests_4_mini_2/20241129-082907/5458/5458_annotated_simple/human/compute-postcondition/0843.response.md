Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is at least 1, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated to 0.***
