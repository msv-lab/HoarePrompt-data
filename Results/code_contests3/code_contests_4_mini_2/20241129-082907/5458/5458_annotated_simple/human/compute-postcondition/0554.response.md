According to the code, the for loop is controlled by the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as the range function will create a sequence from 1 to `s + 1`. In the provided state, `j` is `m + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `m` would need to be at least `m + 1`, which is not possible. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `s` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since there is no direct indication of the value of `s`, we need to include that in our state.

State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, for the loop to execute at least once `s` must be at least 1**
