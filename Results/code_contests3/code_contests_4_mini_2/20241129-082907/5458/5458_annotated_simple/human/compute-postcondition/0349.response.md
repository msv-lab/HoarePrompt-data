Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists either [[0], [0]] or [[0], [0], [0]]. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp` is modified at position `[i][j]` with the value `1`, and `k` is incremented by 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no modification is made to `dp`, and `k` remains the same. If `i` is not equal to 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to include the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` added to it.***
