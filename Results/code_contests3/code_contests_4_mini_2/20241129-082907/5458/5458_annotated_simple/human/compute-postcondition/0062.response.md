The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding to it the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will change based on the previous values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, and `mod` is used to ensure the result fits within the bounds of typical integer representations.

Given that we have:
- `N` is 1
- `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000
- `S` is at least 1
- `mod` is 100000

The specific values of `dp` are not provided, but we can infer that the operation will affect the `dp` array based on its existing values at the specified indices.

The output state will remain unclear regarding specific values of `dp` since they are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we summarize the effect of the operation.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.**
