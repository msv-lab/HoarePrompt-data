The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
