Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the values in the `dp` array are updated based on previous states, but specific results cannot be determined without `dp` values.***
