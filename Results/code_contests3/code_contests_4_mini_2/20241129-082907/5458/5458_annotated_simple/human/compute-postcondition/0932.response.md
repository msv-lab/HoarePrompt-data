Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `s` is a positive integer, the final value of `dp` reflects the results of the calculations performed in the nested loops for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`; the printed output is `dp[n^2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`**
