According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over `k` starting from 1 up to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 1, and `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, meaning it will be 2 in the next iteration, and `s` must be at least 2 to allow the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`.**
