According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n ** 2`. If `i` is less than `n ** 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last value it held which is `N`, which is 1. The loop can execute if `i` is less than `n ** 2`, so for it to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1.

Since `N` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute a second time, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2. Hence, `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values based on the logic defined in the loop for all values of `j` and `k`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be at least 2.**
