According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop is set to execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at its maximum value of `s`. For the loop to be able to execute again, `k` needs to be incremented, which means that `k` would need to be `s + 1`. However, since the loop will not execute for `k` being greater than `s`, it cannot run again.

For the loop to execute one more time, the state must indicate that `k` is 1 and `s` must be at least 1 to allow `k` to start from 1 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, for the loop to execute again `k` must be 1 and `s` must be at least 1.**
