The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The variable `j` is currently 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to 3. The variable `k` is 3. The other variables are not specified, but `dp` is a fully updated list of lists. Therefore, the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` will be copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists; `j` is 2; `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][2][3]**
