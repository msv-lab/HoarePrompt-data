Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `k` is equal to `S`, and `i` has been incremented as per the loop iterations. The final values in `dp` reflect the calculations made during the loop iterations based on the conditions applied.**
