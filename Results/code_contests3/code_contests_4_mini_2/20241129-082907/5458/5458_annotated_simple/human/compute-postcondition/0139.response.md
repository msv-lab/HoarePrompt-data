To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables. 

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `N` is 1
   - `M` is a positive integer (exact value unknown)
   - `j` is either 1 or 2
   - `k` is 3
   - `dp` is modified based on its previous values.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code modifies the `dp` array using the expression:
     ```
     dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] += dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod
     ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `i + 1 & 1` will depend on the value of `i`. If `i` is even, it will yield `1`, and if `i` is odd, it will yield `0`. Since `N` is 1, `i` is likely 0 here, making `i + 1 & 1` equal to `1`.
   - The value of `j` can be either 1 or 2, thus `j + 1` can be either 2 or 3.
   - The value of `k` is 3, thus `k - j` will result in either `2` (if `j` is 1) or `1` (if `j` is 2).
   - The `dp` array is updated at the indices `[1][j + 1][3]` based on the current value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.

4. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The specific value of `dp` cannot be determined without prior values, but it is being modified based on its previous state.
   - The overall state of `N`, `M`, `j`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that while the `dp` array is modified, we cannot specify the exact changes to it without prior knowledge of its values.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is either 1 or 2, `k` is 3; `dp` is modified based on its previous values.**
