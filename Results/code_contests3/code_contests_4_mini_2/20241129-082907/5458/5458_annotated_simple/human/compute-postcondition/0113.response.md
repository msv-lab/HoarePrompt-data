The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the 3D array `dp` at the indices calculated from the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` is evaluated. Since `i` is `0`, we have `0 + 1 & 1` which results in `1 & 1 = 1`. Therefore, the first index is `1`.
2. The value of `j` is `1`, so `j + 1` gives us `2`. Therefore, the second index is `2`.
3. The value of `k` is `1`, so the third index remains `1`.

Thus, the indices for the `dp` array are `[1][2][1]`, and the value at this position is set to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `i` is equal to 0, and `dp[1][2][1]` is set to 1.**
