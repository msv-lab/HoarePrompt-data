Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1 and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value remains at 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1, the program attempts to update `dp[0][3][1]`, but the update cannot be performed due to invalid index access.***
