The code assigns the value `1` to the element at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, `i` is `0`, `j` is `3`, and `k` is `1`. Calculating the indices, we find:

- `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`.
- `j + 1` evaluates to `4`.

Thus, the updated index for `dp` is `dp[1][4][1]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at index [1][4][1] to 1, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [1][4][1] to 1, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
