According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 4. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, which is still valid since `s` is at least 4.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to 4**
