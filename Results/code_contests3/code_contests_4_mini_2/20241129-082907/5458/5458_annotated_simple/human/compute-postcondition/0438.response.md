Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and the loop proceeds to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur in this iteration.***
