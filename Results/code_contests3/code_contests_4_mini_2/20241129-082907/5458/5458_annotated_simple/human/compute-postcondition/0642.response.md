According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be increased by 1. Therefore, `k` will be 2 for the next iteration, and `s` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2, k is 2**
