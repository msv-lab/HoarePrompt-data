The expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to either `0` or `1` based on the value of `i`. If `i` is `1`, then `i + 1` is `2`, and `2 & 1` results in `0`. If `i` is `2`, then `i + 1` is `3`, and `3 & 1` results in `1`. Hence, `dp[i + 1 & 1]` will toggle between `dp[0]` and `dp[1]`.

Considering that `j` is greater than `k` and `k` is initialized to `1`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. This means the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

The other variables `dp`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged apart from the updated value in the `dp` list.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists fully updated, `i` is 1 or 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is 1; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod**.
