The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves indexing into a multi-dimensional array `dp` with the following calculated indices:

1. `i + 1 & 1`: Given that `i` is equal to 0, the expression evaluates as `0 + 1 & 1`, which simplifies to `1 & 1 = 1`. Hence, the first index is `1`.
2. `j + 1`: Since `j` is at least 3, the minimum value for `j + 1` is `4` (if `j` is 3). Therefore, the second index is at least `4`.
3. `k`: Here, `k` is initialized to `1`.

The assignment sets the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` to `1`. The previous states of the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial definitions of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is initialized to 1, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
