According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `M`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `M`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 3. 

For the loop to execute again, `M` must be greater than or equal to 3. The value of `k` is equal to `s`, which is at least 4, and does not affect the condition for the loop execution.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` has been updated based on the condition `j >= k` for respective values of `k`.**
