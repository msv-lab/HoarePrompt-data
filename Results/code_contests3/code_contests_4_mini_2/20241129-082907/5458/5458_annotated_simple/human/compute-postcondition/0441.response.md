Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, with `m` at least 2, `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `s` at least 2, and `k` equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by increasing it by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`; otherwise, no changes occur.***
