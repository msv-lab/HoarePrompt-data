The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement in the current block. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop or block.
