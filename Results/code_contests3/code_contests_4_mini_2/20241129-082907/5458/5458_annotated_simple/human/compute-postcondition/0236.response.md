The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Here, the expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the result of `i + 1` bitwise AND with `1`, which will determine the first index of the `dp` array. The variable `j` is incremented by 1 for the second index, while `k` remains unchanged.

Since `N` is 1, the expression `i + 1 & 1` will yield `0` if `i` is `0` and `1` if `i` is `1`. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is copied to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, but the specific values of `dp` are not provided, so we cannot determine their exact effects, only that the assignment occurs.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `k` is less than `S`, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` takes place.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `k` is less than `S`, and the assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` takes place.**
