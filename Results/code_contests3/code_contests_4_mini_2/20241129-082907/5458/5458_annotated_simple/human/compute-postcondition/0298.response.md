Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 3, `k` is 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][3]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the operation involving `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
