According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1, as the loop range is from 1 to `m + 1`. Given that `n` is at least 1, it does not affect the execution of the loop. The value of `i` starts at 0, which is not relevant to the loop execution. 

For the loop to execute for the first time, `j` will start at 1, so the state needs to reflect that. Thus, the necessary conditions are that `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `j` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
