The command `continue` is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, the values of the variables do not change due to the execution of `continue`, but it indicates that the program will skip the remaining code in the current loop iteration.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp` is updated at indices [1][m + 2][2] with the value from [1][m + 1][2]; `j` is `m + 1`; `i` is 0; `s` is at least 2; `k` is 2 and we skip the rest of the current loop iteration.
