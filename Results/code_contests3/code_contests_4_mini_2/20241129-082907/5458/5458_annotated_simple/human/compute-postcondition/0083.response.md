The code `continue` does not modify any variables but skips the current iteration of the loop it is in. The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `dp`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and the condition that `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `dp` has been updated at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `i` is 1, `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
