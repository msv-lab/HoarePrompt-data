The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. Since `k` is 1, the calculation involves `k - j`, which will depend on the value of `j`. The previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` is used to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0.**
