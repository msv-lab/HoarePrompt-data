Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, when `i` is not 0, `j` is 3, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][2][0] % mod`.***
