According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. Since `s` is at least 4, the loop will run at least 4 times. At the start of the loop, `k` will take the value of 1 during the first iteration. Additionally, the variable `j` is set to 3 and `k` is equal to `s`, but this will be updated as the loop iterates.

Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, the variables need to be:

- `k` should start at 1.
- `s` needs to be at least 4 to ensure the loop runs.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
