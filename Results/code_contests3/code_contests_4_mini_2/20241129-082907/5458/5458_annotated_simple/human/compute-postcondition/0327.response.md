The values of the variables do not change, but we skip the current iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated, `s` is greater than or equal to 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
