According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. Since `s` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `k` will start at 1 and increment up to and including `s`. 

Given that the initial state has `k` equal to `s`, it implies that the loop will execute with `k` starting at 1. The current values of `i`, `j`, `n`, `m`, and `s` do not affect the execution of the loop directly. 

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as `s` being at least 1 ensures the loop's execution, and `k` starts at 1, which is valid.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1 for the loop to execute the first time**
