Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is initialized to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is at least 1, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
