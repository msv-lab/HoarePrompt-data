Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, and `mod` is 100000. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the value at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1; otherwise, if `i` is 1, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the addition of `dp[1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variable `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1.***
