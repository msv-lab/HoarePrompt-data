The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables are affected as follows:
- `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` gets updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.
- The variable `k` is 1, and since `j` is 3, `k - j` results in a negative index (1 - 3 = -2). 
- Accessing `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` would typically be out of bounds unless the data structure is designed to handle it, but assuming it results in 0, the update will not affect the state significantly.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is incremented by 0 due to the negative index and thus remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by 0, resulting in no change.**
