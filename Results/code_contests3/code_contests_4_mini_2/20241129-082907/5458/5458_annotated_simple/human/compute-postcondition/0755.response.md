The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves updating a value in a multidimensional array or list structure based on previous values. The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the bitwise AND of `i + 1` and `1`. Given that `i` is 0, `i + 1` will be 1, and `1 & 1` results in 1. Therefore, the first index of `dp` refers to `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.

The second index `j + 1` will depend on the original value of `j`, which is at least 1. Hence, `j + 1` will be at least 2.

The value being assigned to `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is `dp[1][j][k]`, meaning we are copying the value from the previous index `j` of the same `k`.

The other variables `n`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after running this code will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables and the operation performed on the `dp` array.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]**.
