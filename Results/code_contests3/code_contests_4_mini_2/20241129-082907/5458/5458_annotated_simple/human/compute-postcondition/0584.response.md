Postcondition: ***`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp[1][m + 2][3]` remains unchanged. In the else case, `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is updated with the value from `dp[1][m + 1][3] % mod`, and `dp[1][m + 2][3]` is further updated by adding `dp[0][m + 1][3 - (m + 1)] % mod`.***
