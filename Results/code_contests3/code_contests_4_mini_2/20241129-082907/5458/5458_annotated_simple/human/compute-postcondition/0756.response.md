The code snippet `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, while the variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged, the execution context indicates that we are continuing to the next loop iteration without modifying any variable values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
