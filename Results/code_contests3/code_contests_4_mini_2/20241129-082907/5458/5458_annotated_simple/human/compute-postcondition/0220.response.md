Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `i` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
