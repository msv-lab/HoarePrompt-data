Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `dp` updated at [1][j + 1][1] to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value at `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1.***
