Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists. If `i` equals 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `1`, with `i` remaining `0`, `j` still greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` less than or equal to `s`. If `i` equals 0 but the condition doesn't hold, then `dp` has been updated such that `i` remains `0`, `j` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is now the previous value plus `dp[0][j][k - j] % mod.`***
