Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
