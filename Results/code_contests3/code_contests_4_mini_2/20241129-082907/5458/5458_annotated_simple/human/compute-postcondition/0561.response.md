The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves assigning a value from one index of the `dp` list to another. The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is assigned to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. 

Since `j` is `m + 1`, which is greater than `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0, we can infer that the operation will access the `dp` structure without causing an index error. The specific values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, but we are assured that the operation will execute correctly.

Thus, the output state reflects the assignment made in the `dp` structure, but does not change the values of `i`, `j`, or `k` themselves. Therefore, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `j` is `m + 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
