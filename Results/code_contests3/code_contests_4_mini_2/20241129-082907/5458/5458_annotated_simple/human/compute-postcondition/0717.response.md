According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the variable `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 4. For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4**
