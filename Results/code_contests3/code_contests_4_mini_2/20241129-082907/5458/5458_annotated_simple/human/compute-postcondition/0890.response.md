The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop that we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
