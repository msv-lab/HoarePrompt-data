According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `j`, which iterates from 1 to `m`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than or equal to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1, and `m` is at least 2, meaning that `j` can take values up to `m`. 

If `j` was at least 1 at the end of the last iteration, to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `j` will be incremented to 2, and `m` must be at least 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is 2, `s` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`.**
