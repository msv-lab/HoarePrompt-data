The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, and we continue to the next iteration of the closest loop.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, and we continue to the next iteration of the closest loop.**
