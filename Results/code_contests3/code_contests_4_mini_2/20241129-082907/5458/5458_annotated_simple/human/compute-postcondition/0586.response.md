According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop runs for `j` starting at 1 and goes up to `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2, and `m` must be at least 1 so that the loop can start again. 

State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is 2, `s` is at least `s`, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again `m` must be at least 1**
