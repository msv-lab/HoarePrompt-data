In the provided code snippet, the expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates an assignment operation within a multi-dimensional array or list named `dp`. 

Here, `i` has an initial value of `N`, which is 1. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will compute to `2 & 1`, which evaluates to `0` since the binary representation of `2` is `10` and for `1` it is `01`, leading to the result `00` in binary (0 in decimal). Thus, the left-hand side of the assignment becomes `dp[0][j + 1][k]`.

The right-hand side of the assignment also involves `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, which again computes to `dp[0][j][k]` (using the same reasoning as above).

The variables `M`, `S`, `mod`, and `k` do not change as a result of this assignment operation. 

Therefore, the output state after executing the statement reflects the unchanged values of `M`, `S`, `mod`, and `k`, along with the assignment that has been made to `dp`.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `k` is 2, `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.**
