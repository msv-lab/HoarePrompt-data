The statement updates the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` are involved in the indexing, but the values of `dp` and `mod` are not provided and are essential for calculating a specific output. 

The variable `i` is 2, so `i + 1 & 1` results in `3 & 1`, which equals 1 (since 3 in binary is `11` and 1 is `01`, resulting in `01`â€”which is 1). The variable `j` is 1, so `j + 1` equals 2. The variable `k` is 1. 

Therefore, the indexing results in `dp[1][2][1]`. The value assigned to `dp[1][2][1]` is calculated from `dp[1][1][1] % mod`.

Since the specific values of `dp` and `mod` are not given, I cannot provide a numerical output. However, the states of the variables are:

- `n` is at least 2
- `m` is at least 1
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 1
- `s` is at least 1
- `k` is 1
- `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned based on `dp[1][1][1] % mod`

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `dp[1][2][1]` is assigned based on `dp[1][1][1] % mod**.
