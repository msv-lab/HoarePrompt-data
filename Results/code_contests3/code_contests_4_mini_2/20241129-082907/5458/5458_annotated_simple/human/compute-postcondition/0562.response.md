The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement indicates that we skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `j` is `m + 1`, `j` is greater than `k`, and `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
