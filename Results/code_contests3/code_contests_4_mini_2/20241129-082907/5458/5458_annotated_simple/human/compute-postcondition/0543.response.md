According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` in relation to `s`. The loop iterates from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its last value, which is `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented to `s + 1`, and since the loop does not execute with `k` equal to `s + 1`, it will not execute again.

State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be less than `s`.**
