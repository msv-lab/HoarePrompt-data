The assignment is made to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which utilizes the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. The current values are `i`, which is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. 

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` computes the bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`. This operation will yield either `0` or `1`, depending on whether `i` is `0` (resulting in `1 & 1 = 1`) or at least `1` (resulting in `2 & 1 = 0` for `i = 1`).

2. The value of `j + 1` will be `3` since `j` is `2`.

3. The value of `k` remains `3`.

Thus, the assignment will affect the array `dp` at either `dp[1][3][3]` (if `i` is `0`) or `dp[0][3][3]` (if `i` is at least `1`). In both cases, the assigned value is `1`.

The values of other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
