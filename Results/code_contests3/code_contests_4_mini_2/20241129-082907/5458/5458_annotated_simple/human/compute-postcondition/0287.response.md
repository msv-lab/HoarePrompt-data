The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The previous state of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is relevant for determining the new value. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the modification of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `j` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
