The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
