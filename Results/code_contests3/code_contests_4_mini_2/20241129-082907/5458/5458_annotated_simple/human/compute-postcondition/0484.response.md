Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists that has been fully updated based on the conditions set in the loop for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, with `m` at least 3, `i` being 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration, `j` equal to the maximum value considered, and `s` equal to the final value iterated over. The values in `dp[1][j + 1][k]` reflect the computed results based on the conditions applied during the iterations.**
