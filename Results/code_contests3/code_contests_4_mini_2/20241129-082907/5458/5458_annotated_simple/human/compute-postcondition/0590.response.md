In the provided code snippet, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1`, the following changes occur:

1. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` equals 1, and `1 & 1` equals 1. Therefore, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will be accessed.
2. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` equals 3. This means we are accessing `dp[1][3][k]`.
3. The value of `k` is 1. 

Thus, the statement modifies the value at `dp[1][3][1]` to be 1.

The states of the other variables (`dp`, `j`, `s`, `i`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the updates made to the `dp` list based on the calculations above.

Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists; `j` is 2; `s` is at least 1; `i` is 0; `k` is 1; `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.**
