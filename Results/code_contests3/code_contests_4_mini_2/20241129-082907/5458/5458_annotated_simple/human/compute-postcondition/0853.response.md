According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2 and `s` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 3. 

Also, the loop will continue executing as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`.**
