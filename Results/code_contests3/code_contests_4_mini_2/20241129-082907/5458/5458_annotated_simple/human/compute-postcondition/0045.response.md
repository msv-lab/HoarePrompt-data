The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves multiple operations. First, we need to evaluate `i + 1 & 1`, which results in `1 & 1 = 1`. Given that `i` is `0`, `i + 1` becomes `1`, and `1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. 

Next, we consider `j + 1`, where `j` is `2`. Therefore, `j + 1` becomes `3`. 

Now we can update the `dp` array:
- `dp[1][3][1] = 1` 

The values of `N`, `M`, `S`, `mod`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S` which is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `dp` contains updated values with `dp[1][3][1]` set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S` which is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `dp` contains updated values with `dp[1][3][1]` set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
