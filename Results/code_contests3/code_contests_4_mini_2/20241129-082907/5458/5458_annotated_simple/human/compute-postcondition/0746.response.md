The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` involves indexing into a multidimensional data structure `dp`. The value `i + 1 & 1` computes the index for the first dimension, while `j + 1` and `k` correspond to the second and third dimensions, respectively. 

Since `i` is 0, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. Therefore, the first index is `1`. The value of `j` is at least 1, which means `j + 1` will be at least `2`. The value of `k` remains `2`.

The assignment operation sets the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` to be equal to the value at `dp[1][j][k]`. 

The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment operation.

Thus, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and the value at `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to the value at `dp[1][j][k]**.
