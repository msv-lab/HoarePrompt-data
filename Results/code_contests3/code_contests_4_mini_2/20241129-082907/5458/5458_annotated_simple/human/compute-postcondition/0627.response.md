According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate `n ** 2` times. If `n` is 0, then `n ** 2` is also 0, meaning the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, the state includes the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`, which can be any integers, and `dp` is a list initialized with dimensions [2][m + 1][s + 1]. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be adjusted to be at least 1, and `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is input integer, `s` is input integer, `i` is 0, for the loop to execute the first time `n` must be greater than 0**
