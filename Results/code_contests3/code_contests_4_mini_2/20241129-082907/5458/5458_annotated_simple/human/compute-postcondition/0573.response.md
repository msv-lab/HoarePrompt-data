The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are as follows: `i` is 0, `j` is `m + 1`, and `k` is 2. The operation `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1 & 1`, which is 1. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` equals 1. The variable `j + 1` will be `m + 2`.

Since `j` is greater than `k` (as `m + 1` is greater than 2), the assignment will proceed. The value being assigned is taken from `dp[1][m][2]` and is taken modulo `mod`. 

The output state indicates that the list `dp` has been updated at the specified indices, but the exact values of `dp` or `mod` are not provided, so they cannot be specified in the output state. 

Output State: **`dp` is updated at indices [1][m + 2][2] with the value from [1][m + 1][2] % mod**.
