According to the code, the for loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `s` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1, making `k` equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, it must be true that `k` is less than or equal to `s`, meaning `s` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 2**
