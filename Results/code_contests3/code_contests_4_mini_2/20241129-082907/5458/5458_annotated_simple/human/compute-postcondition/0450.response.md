Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated at index `[1][3][3]` to `1` if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `dp` is updated at index `[1][3][3]` by adding the value of `dp[0][2][1] % mod`. The values of `m`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain as stated, with `m` at least 2, `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `s` at least 3, and `k` equal to 3.***
