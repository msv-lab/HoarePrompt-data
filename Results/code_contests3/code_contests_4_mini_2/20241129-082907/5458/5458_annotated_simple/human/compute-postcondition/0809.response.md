According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and its relationship to `s`. The loop iterates over `k` from 1 to `s`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, and `k` is initialized to 1. Since `k` is incremented in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, the variable `s` must be at least 2 (since `s` is at least 1, it must be greater than or equal to `k` for the next iteration).

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
