Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, and `k` must be 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, we continue in the loop for further iterations.***
