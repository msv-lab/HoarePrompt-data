Postcondition: ***`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][m + 2][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value from `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo `mod`.***
