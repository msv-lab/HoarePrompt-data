According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. If the loop is to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. Since `s` is at least 2, after incrementing `k`, it will be 3. Thus, for the loop to execute a second time, `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1 or 2, `k` is 3, and for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be at least 3.**
