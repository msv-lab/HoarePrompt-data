The code `continue` does not change any variable values but instructs the program to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. This behavior affects the flow of execution but not the values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
