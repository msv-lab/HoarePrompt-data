Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists. If `i` is 0, then for each `j` greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1 or 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The values in `dp` are determined by the conditions and updates specified in the loop, and the loop will execute `s` times, where `s` is a valid positive integer.**
