According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `s`, starting from 1 up to and including `s`. The variable `k` is updated in each iteration of the loop. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to its previous value plus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

Since `s` is not explicitly provided in the state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider that `k` was previously `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be equal to `s + 1`, which means the loop cannot execute again. 

So, the only adjustment needed is to increment `k` by 1, and since the loop will not execute again, we can state that `k` will be `s + 1`.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists fully updated, for the loop to execute again `k` must be less than or equal to `s, k is s + 1**
