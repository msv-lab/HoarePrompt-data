The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined to take no input. Instead, it operates on multiple datasets provided through standard input until it encounters the line "0 0 0". Each dataset consists of three positive integers: `N`, `M`, and `S`, where `N` is constrained to 1 ≤ N ≤ 7, `M` is constrained to 1 ≤ M ≤ 2000, and `S` is constrained to 1 ≤ S ≤ 3000. 

The function processes these datasets and produces output based on the input values. The specifics of the output are not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple datasets of three positive integers (N, M, S) until it encounters "0 0 0", with constraints on the values of N, M, and S.**
