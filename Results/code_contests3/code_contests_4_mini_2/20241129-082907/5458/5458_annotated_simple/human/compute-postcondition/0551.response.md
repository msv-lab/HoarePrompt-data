Postcondition: ***`dp` is a fully updated list of lists. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no action is taken. In the else part, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its current value. In either case, the value of `k` remains less than `s` for the loop to execute a second time.***
