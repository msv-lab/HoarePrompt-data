Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][2]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] + dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
