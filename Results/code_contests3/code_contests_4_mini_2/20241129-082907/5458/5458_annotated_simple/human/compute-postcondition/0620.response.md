Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists fully updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, with dimensions [2][m + 1][s + 1]. The values in `dp` depend on the relationships established through the iterations, particularly the conditions involving `j`, `k`, and `i`. `i` is either 0 or 1 depending on the last iteration executed, `m` is the total number of iterations for `j`, and `s` is the total number of iterations for `k`.**
