Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with an element assigned to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is increased by 1, and `k` must remain less than or equal to `s`. If `i` is not 0 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value.***
