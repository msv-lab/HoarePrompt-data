The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. Given the initial state, `n`, `m`, and `s` are at least 2, and `k` is equal to `s + 1`. The loop condition indicates that `s` must be increased to at least `k` for further execution. However, the specific values of `i`, `j`, and `dp` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact changes in those variables. The overall state of `n`, `m`, `s`, and `k` remains unaffected in this context.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]**
