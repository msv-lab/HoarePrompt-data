According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which iterates from 1 to `s + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2. Since `s` is at least 2, the next value for `k` would be 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `k` must be incremented to 3, and `s` must be at least 3 to ensure the loop can continue executing.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3**
