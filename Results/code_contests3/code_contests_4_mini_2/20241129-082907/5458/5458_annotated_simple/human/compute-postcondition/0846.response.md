Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] is updated to 1.***
