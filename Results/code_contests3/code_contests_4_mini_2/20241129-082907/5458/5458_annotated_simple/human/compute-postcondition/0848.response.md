The values of the variables do not change as the `continue` statement is executed, which causes the program to skip the current iteration of the loop it is inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
