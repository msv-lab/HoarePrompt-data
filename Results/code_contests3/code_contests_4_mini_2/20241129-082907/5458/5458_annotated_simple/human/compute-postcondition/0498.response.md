Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists fully updated. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes are made to `dp`. If `i` is 1, then `dp` is updated at index [0][j + 1][1] based on `dp[1][j][1 - (m + 1)] % mod`.***
