The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` indicates that the value at the position `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0`. The variables `j` and `k` are not explicitly stated in terms of their values but are constrained as follows: `j` is greater than `k` (which is 2). 

Since `j` is greater than `k`, we can assume possible values for `j` are at least 3. Therefore, the position `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is being affected by the value of `dp[0][j][k]`.

The output state will reflect that `dp[0][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the modulo operation applied to `dp[0][j][k]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][k] % mod**
