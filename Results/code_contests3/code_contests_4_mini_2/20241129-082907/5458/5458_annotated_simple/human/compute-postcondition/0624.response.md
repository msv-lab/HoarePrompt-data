The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `s` is an input integer; `dp` remains a list of lists with dimensions [2][m + 1][s + 1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
