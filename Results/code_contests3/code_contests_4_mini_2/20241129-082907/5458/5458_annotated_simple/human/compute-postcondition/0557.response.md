The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the element at the specified index of the list `dp`. Here, `i` is `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which is `1`. The variable `j` is `m + 1` and is greater than or equal to `k`, meaning `j + 1` will also be valid in the context of the list. Therefore, the specific indices being set are `dp[1][j + 1][k]`.

Since `dp` is a fully updated list of lists, the assignment will modify the value at that index without affecting the other variables or the structure of `dp`. 

Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.**
