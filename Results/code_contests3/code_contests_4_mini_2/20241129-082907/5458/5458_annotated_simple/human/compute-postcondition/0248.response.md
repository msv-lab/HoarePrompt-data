Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `k` is equal to `S`, `j` is `M + 1`, `i` is equal to 0, if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1.***
