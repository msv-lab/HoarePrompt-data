The code assigns the value `1` to the `dp` array at the position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to `1` if `i` is `0`, and `0` if `i` were `1`, which is not the case here since `i` is `0`. Thus, `i + 1 & 1` results in `1`. The value of `j` is currently `2`, so `j + 1` results in `3`. The value of `k` remains `1`. Therefore, the position in the `dp` array being updated is `[1][3][1]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated at position [1][3][1] to 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated at position [1][3][1] to 1.**
