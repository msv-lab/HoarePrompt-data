Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. Otherwise, the state of `dp` is modified based on its previous values without affecting `N`, `M`, `j`, or `k`.***
