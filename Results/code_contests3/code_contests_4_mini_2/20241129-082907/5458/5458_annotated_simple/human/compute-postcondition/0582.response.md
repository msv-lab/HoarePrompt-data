The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The variables `i`, `j`, and `k` have previous values of `0`, `m + 1`, and `3` respectively. The `&` operator is used here, but since `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`, thus the expression becomes `dp[1][j + 1][3]`. 

Since `j` is `m + 1`, it can be concluded that `j + 1` is `m + 2`. The final assignment updates the list `dp` at the index `[1][m + 2][3]` with the value from `dp[1][m + 1][3]` taken modulo `mod`. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indexes [1][m + 2][3] with the value from [1][m + 1][3] % mod; `i` is 0, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3. 
Output State: **`dp` is updated at indexes [1][m + 2][3] with the value from [1][m + 1][3] % mod; `i` is 0, `j` is m + 1, `k` is 3**
