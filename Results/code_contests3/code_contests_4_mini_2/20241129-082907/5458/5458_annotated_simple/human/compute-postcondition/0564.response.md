The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. The state of `dp` is updated at the specified indices based on the existing value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at the indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `j` is greater than `k`.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at the indices [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, `j` is `m + 1`, and `j` is greater than `k**.
