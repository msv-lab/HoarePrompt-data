The statement involves a multidimensional array assignment with certain indices calculated based on the current values of `i`, `j`, and `k`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2
- `k` is equal to `s + 1`, which means `k` is at least 3 (since `s` is at least 2)
- `j` is either 1 or 2
- `i` is equal to 0

The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modifies a specific entry in the `dp` array. 

- `i + 1 & 1` results in either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i + 1` is even or odd. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, and `1 & 1` is 1. Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to 1.
- `j + 1` produces either 2 or 3.
- `k` remains `s + 1`, which is greater than `s` at this stage.

Thus, the affected indices in the `dp` array are:
- The left-hand side index is `dp[1][j + 1][k]`, which depends on the value of `j` (either `dp[1][2][k]` or `dp[1][3][k]`).
- The right-hand side index is `dp[1][j][k]`, which corresponds to either `dp[1][1][k]` or `dp[1][2][k]`.

The assignment means that the value from the right-hand side is copied to the left-hand side for the specified indices.

Since the overall values of the `dp` array are not specified, we note that the operation does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `k`, `j`, or `i`. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is equal to 0; and `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][j][k]`.**
