The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, `k` is equal to `S`, `j` is `M + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, `j` is greater than `k` and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
