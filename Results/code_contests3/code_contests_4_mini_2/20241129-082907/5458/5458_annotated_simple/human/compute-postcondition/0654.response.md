The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` indicates that we are accessing a multidimensional array or list called `dp`. The first index involves a bitwise AND operation between `i + 1` and `1`, which results in either `0` or `1` depending on whether `i` is even or odd. Given that `i` is `0`, `i + 1` is `1`, and `1 & 1` results in `1`. Thus, the first index evaluates to `1`.

The second index is `j + 1`, and since `j` is `1`, this evaluates to `2`.

The third index is `k`, which is `3`.

Thus, the left-hand side of the assignment can be rewritten as `dp[1][2][3]`.

On the right-hand side, we have `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Following the same logic, the first index remains `1`, the second index is `j` (which is `1`), and the third index is still `3`. Therefore, the right-hand side evaluates to `dp[1][1][3]`.

This means we are assigning the value of `dp[1][1][3]` to `dp[1][2][3]`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`.**
