Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists fully updated, `i` is 1, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[1 + 1 & 1][m + 1 + 1][1]` is assigned the value of `dp[1 + 1 & 1][m + 1][1]`, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, no changes occur.***
