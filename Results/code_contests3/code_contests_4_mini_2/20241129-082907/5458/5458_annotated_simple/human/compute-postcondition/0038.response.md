The code updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`, taken modulo `mod`. 

Given the initial state:
- `N` is 1
- `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000
- `S` is at least 3
- `mod` is 100000
- `k` is 3

The affected variable is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`, which is updated based on the values of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. We need to consider the values of `i`, `j`, and their respective indices.

The output state indicates the change to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` based on the current values in `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]`. Since we don't have specific values for `dp`, we cannot provide exact numbers but can describe the relationship.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` modulo 100000**.
