According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently 2, and for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented. The loop runs while `k` is in the range from 1 to `s`, so for the loop to execute again, `k` must be 3, and `s` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3**
