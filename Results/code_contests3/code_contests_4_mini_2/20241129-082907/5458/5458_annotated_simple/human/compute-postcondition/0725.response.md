Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 4, and `k` is 4. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is assigned the value 1 at the position [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `k`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
