Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
