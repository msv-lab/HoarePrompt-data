According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `s`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `s`, inclusive. In order for the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least `1`. The given state indicates that `k` is at least `s`, which means that `s` must also be at least `1`. The starting value of `k` in the first iteration will be `1`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `s` is at least `1`, and the initial value of `k` is `1`.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated based on the conditions provided in the loop, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
