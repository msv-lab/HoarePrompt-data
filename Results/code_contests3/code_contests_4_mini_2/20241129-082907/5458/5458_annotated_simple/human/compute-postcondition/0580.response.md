The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated at indexes [1][m + 2][3] with the value from [1][m + 1][3], `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `k` is 3 and we continue to the next iteration of the nearest loop.
