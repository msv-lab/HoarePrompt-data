According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` with respect to `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2, meaning `n` must be greater than the square root of 2, which is approximately 1.414. 

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.414.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp` has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop, `m` is the total number of iterations for `j`, `s` is the total number of iterations for `k`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute a second time `n` must be greater than 1.414**
