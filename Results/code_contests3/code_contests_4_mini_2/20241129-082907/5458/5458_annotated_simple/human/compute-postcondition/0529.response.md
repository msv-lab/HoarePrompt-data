The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a list of lists fully updated; `i` is 1 or 2; `j` is greater than `k`; `k` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
