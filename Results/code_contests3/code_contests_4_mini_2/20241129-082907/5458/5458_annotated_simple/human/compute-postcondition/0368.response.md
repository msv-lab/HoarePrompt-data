The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `j` is currently 2, so `j + 1` becomes 3. The specific value of `i` is not provided, but `i + 1 & 1` will yield either `0` or `1` based on the parity of `i + 1`. The variable `k` remains 3. The output state will reflect the fact that the entry `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is being updated based on the previous value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `j` is 2, so `j + 1` is 3, and `k` is 3.**
