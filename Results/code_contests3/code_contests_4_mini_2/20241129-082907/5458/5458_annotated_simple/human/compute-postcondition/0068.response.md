The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
