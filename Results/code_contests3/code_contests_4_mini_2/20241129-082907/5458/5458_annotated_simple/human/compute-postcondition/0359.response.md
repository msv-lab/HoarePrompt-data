The statement assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value of `i + 1 & 1` will determine the first index, and since `i` is not equal to 0, `i + 1` will always yield a value of at least 1. The value of `j + 1` will be greater than 2, as `j` is greater than 2. Therefore, the assignment modifies the value in the list of lists `dp` based on the current indices.

The output state reflects the unchanged dimensions of `dp`, while noting that the value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` has been updated to match `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than 2, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, `i` is not equal to 0; `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
