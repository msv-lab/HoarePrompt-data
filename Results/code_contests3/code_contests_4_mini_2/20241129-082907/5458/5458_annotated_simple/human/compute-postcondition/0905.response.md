The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is at least 2, `k` is equal to `s`, `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
