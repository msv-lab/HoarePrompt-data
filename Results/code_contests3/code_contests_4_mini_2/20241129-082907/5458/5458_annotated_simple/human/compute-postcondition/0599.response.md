Postcondition: ***`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is greater than 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, but note that `k - j` results in a negative index.***
