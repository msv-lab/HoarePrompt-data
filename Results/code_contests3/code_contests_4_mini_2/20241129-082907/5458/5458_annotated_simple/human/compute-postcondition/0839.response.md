The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1; `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
