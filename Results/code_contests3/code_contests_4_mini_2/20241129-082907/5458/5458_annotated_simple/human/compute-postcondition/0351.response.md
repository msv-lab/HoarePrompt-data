According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 2 and must be less than or equal to `m`, meaning `m` must be at least 2.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`, for the loop to execute a second time `m` must be at least 2, and `j` is 2.**
