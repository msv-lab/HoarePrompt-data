The value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The indexing is performed using `j` which is 3 and `k` which is 3. Thus, `j + 1` becomes 4 and `k` remains 3. The other variables `i` and `mod` are not specified, but the operation is performed on the list `dp`. The output state reflects the assignment without changing the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists, `j` is equal to 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is equal to 3; `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][3][3] % mod**
