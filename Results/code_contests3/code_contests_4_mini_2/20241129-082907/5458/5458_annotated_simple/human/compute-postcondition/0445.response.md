The expression `i + 1 & 1` calculates the result of `i + 1` which is `3`, and then performs a bitwise AND operation with `1`. The result of this operation is `1` (since `3 & 1` equals `1`). 

The value of `j + 1` is `3` (since `j` is `2`).

The assignment `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` becomes `dp[1][3][3]`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` becomes `dp[1][2][3]`. 

Therefore, we are assigning the value of `dp[1][2][3]` to `dp[1][3][3]`. 

The values of `m`, `s`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`dp` is updated such that `dp[1][3][3]` is equal to `dp[1][2][3]`; `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3.**
