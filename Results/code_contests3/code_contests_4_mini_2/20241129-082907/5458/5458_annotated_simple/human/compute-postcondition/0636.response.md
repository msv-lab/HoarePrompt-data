The line of code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are given, and we know that `j` is greater than `k`, which implies `j + 1` is at least 2. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is not specified, but it will be copied to the new index `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`.

Since the specific values of `dp` are not provided, we can only state that the value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is transferred to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` without altering the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship of the indices and their assignments.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `j` is greater than `k`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`.**
