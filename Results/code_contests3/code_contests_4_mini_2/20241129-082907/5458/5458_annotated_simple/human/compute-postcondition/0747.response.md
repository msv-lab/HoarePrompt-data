The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
