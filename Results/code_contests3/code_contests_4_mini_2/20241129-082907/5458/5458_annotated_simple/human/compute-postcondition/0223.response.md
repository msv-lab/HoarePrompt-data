Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 2, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated using `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
