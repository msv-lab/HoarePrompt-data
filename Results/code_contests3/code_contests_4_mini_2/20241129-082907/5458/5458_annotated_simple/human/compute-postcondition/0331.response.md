Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists where `dp` is initially [[0], [0]]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated to [[0], [1]]. If `j` is less than `k`, the values of `dp`, `s`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`, while `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and `k` is 1.***
