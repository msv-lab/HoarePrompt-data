According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute if `s` is at least 1, as it iterates from 1 to `s` (inclusive). Before the loop starts, `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1, but these values do not directly affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to confirm that `s` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is greater than or equal to 1**
