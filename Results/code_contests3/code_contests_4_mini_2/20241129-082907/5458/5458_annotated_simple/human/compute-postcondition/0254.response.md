The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The variable `j` is equal to `M + 1`, which is greater than `k` (where `k` is equal to `S`). Thus, the condition `if j > k` is satisfied, and we are currently in the most internal loop. However, since `j` is greater than `k`, we do not modify any of the variables in this specific code snippet, but we acknowledge that we would continue to the next iteration in the loop.

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `k` is equal to `S`, `j` is `M + 1`, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
