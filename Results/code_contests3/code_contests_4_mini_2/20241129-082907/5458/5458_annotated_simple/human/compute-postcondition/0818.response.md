According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop has executed for `k = 1` and `k = 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to 3, and `s` must be at least 3 to allow for that.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
