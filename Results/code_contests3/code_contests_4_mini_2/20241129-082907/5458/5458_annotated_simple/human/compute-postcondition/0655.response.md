The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and `dp[1][2][3]` is assigned the value of `dp[1][1][3]`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
