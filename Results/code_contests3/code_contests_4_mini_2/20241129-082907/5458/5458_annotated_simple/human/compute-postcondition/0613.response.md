The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change as a result of the `continue` statement, but it indicates that the loop will continue without executing any subsequent code in the current iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a fully updated list of lists; `j` is 2; `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists; `j` is 2; `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
