Postcondition: ***`dp` remains a list of lists fully updated. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to `s`, preventing the loop from executing a second time. If `j` is greater than `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped; since `k` is equal to `s`, the loop will not execute a second time. The updates to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` occur only when `j` is not greater than `k`.***
