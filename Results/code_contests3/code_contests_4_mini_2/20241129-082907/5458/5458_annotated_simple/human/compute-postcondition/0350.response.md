Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp` is updated based on the conditions of `i`, `j`, and `k`. Specifically, if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `s`, then `dp` will contain values based on the conditions set in the loop, while if `i` is not 0, `dp` will contain values derived from previous iterations. The exact structure of `dp` depends on the values of `s`, `j`, and `k` during the iterations.**
