The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it indicates that the current iteration of the loop is to be skipped, and the program will continue to the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is a list of lists, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 2, and `k` is 2, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
