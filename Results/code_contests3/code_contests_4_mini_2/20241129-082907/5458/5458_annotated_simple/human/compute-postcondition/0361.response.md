Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists, `m` is at least 2, `j` is greater than 2, `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time, `k` is 2, and `i` is not equal to 0. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the loop continues to the next iteration.***
