Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment operation affects the `dp` array at the specified indices. If `i` is not 0, the loop continues to the next iteration without making any changes.***
