Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with an element assigned to 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the state of `dp` remains with an element assigned to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, there are no changes made to `dp`. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod.***
