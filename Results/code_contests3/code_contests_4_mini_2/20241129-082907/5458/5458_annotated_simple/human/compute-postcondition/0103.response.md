The expression assigns a value to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. The value being assigned is `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, and `mod` influence this operation. Specifically, `mod` is 100000. 

Since the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `k` are not provided, we can't determine the precise effect on the state of `dp`. However, we know that the operation involves taking an existing value from `dp` indexed by `i + 1 & 1`, `j`, and `k`, then applying the modulo operation with `mod`.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the existing value from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` modulo `mod`. 

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % 100000`**
