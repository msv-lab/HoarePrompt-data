The statement updates the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` to 1. Given that `i` is 0, the expression `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which results in `1`. The value of `j` is 3, so `j + 1` equals 4. The value of `k` is 1. 

Therefore, the assignment results in `dp[1][4][1]` being set to 1. The other variables (`dp`, `m`, `j`, `s`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`dp` is a list of lists where `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1; `m` is at least 2; `j` is 3; `s` is at least 1; `k` is 1; `i` is 0; and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
