The code `continue` does not change the values of any variables, but it skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds to the next one. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, where `j` is 2 and `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
