The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is 2, and `dp[0][3][4]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][2][4]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
