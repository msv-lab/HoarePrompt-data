Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, the assignment operation affects the `dp` array at the specified indices, but the exact values of `dp` are not provided. Otherwise, there is no else part to consider.***
