Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, and `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
