The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `k` is 2, and `dp[0][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][j][2]` while continuing to the next iteration of the loop.
