Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, and `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`. If `i` is equal to 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is not equal to 0, we either continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement, or `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated with the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
