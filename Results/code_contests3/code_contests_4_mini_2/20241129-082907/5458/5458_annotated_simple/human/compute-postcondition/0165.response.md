According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is at least 3, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and `k` is 3. Since `k` is initialized to 1 and will be incremented with each iteration of the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be 4 and `s` must be at least 4 to allow for the loop to run one additional time (since the loop continues while `k` is less than or equal to `s`).

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 2, `k` is 4**
