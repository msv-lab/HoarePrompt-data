Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, and `dp` is a 2 x (`M` + 2) list of lists initialized with zeros. If `i` is 0, then `dp[1][2][k]` is set to 1 for all `k` where `j` is greater than or equal to `k` and `k` is within a valid range. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] % mod`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
