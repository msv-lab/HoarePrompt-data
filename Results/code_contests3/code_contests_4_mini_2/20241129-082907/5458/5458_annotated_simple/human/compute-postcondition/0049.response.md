The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` updates the `dp` array at the specified indices. 

1. The value of `i` is 1, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `0` (since `1 + 1 = 2` in binary is `10`, and `10 & 01 = 00`).
2. The value of `j` is 2, so `j + 1` evaluates to `3`.
3. The value of `k` is 1.

The statement `dp[0][3][1] = dp[0][2][1]` means that the value at `dp[0][3][1]` is now set to whatever value is currently stored in `dp[0][2][1]`. 

Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `dp` now has updated values at `dp[0][3][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `dp` now has updated values at `dp[0][3][1]`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and `j` is greater than `k`.**
