The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there are no changes to the values of the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, or `k`, the output state reflects that we are continuing within a loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1; dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k] and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
