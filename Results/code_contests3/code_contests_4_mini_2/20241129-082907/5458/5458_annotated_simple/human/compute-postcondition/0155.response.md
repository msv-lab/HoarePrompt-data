Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, if `i` is 0, then `dp` has been updated such that `dp[1][3][2] = 1`, and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, if `i` is not 0, `j` is greater than `k`, `k` is 2, `dp` has been updated, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` remains unchanged due to negative indexing.***
