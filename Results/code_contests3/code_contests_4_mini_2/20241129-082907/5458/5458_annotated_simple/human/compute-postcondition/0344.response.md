The line of code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]`. This means that the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` in the list of lists `dp` will now be equal to the value at position `[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The overall structure of `dp` remains the same, but the specific entry is updated based on the previous state.

Since `dp` can either be `[[0], [0]]` or `[[0], [0], [0]]`, the specific entries affected will depend on the values of `i`, `j`, and `k`, and the current state of `dp` before this assignment.

The states of other variables are not affected, so the output state will capture the condition of `dp` after the assignment:

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index [i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] to be equal to `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`**
