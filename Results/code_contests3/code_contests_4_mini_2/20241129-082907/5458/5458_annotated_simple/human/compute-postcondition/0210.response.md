According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute for values of `j` from 1 to `m` (inclusive). Since `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 
Before the loop starts, `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values, and `i` is 2. For the loop to execute the first time, `j` should start at 1 and must be less than or equal to `m`. 

Therefore, to ensure that the loop executes correctly, the state must indicate that `m` is at least 1. 

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `dp` contains updated values for all values of `j` and `k`, `i` is 2, for the loop to execute the first time `m` is at least 1 and `j` is 1**
