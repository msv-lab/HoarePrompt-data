According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute again if `k` can take a value up to `s`, which is at least 1 at the end of the last iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is 0. 

Since the loop variable `k` starts at 1 and can go up to `s`, the next value for `k` will be 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must be at least 2. Therefore, `k` will be 2 in the next iteration.

State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 2, and `i` is 0, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
