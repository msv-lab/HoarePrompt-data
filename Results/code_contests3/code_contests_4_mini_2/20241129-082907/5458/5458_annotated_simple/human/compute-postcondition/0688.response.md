The code `continue` is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. However, since the values of the variables do not change during this operation, the output state remains the same as the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2; the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
