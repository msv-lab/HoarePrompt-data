Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists fully updated. If `i` is equal to 0, then for each `j` greater than or equal to `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][1]` is set to 1. Otherwise, if `i` is 1 or 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
