Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S` which is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `dp` contains updated values with `dp[1][3][1]` set to 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `k` is 1. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1.***
