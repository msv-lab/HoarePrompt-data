The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 2, and `dp[0][4][2]` is assigned the value of `dp[0][3][2]`.
