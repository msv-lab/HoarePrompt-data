Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `m` at least 2, `j` equal to 3, `s` at least 2, and `k` equal to 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is modified at the indices determined by `i + 1 & 1`, `4`, and `2`. Otherwise, an attempt to update `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` results in an out-of-bounds access attempt due to an invalid index `k - j`, which is at least -1.***
