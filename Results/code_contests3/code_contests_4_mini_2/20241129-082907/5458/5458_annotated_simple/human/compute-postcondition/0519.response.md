According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n ** 2`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n ** 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 or 1, and `n` is at least the total number of iterations completed, which means `n ** 2` is greater than or equal to 1. 

If `i` is 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1 to become 1. If `i` is 1, it will be incremented to 2. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n ** 2`. Therefore, the next state should reflect that `i` is now 1 or 2, and `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists fully updated based on the conditions set in the loop for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and for all values of `k` from 1 to `s`, `i` is 1 or 2 depending on the last iteration, for the loop to execute again `n` must be such that `n ** 2` is greater than 2**.
