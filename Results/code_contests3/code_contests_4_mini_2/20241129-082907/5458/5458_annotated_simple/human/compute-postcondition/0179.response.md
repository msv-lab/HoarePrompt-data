The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` involves a bitwise operation and indexing. To understand the impact:

1. **Calculate `i + 1 & 1`:**
   - `i` is `0`. So, `i + 1` equals `1`.
   - `1 & 1` results in `1`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`.

2. **Calculate `j + 1`:**
   - `j` is `3`. So, `j + 1` equals `4`.

3. **The index used is `dp[1][4][k]`:**
   - The value of `k` is `1`, but its specific value does not affect the assignment in this context because we are only assigning a value to `dp[1][4][k]`.

4. **Assignment:**
   - `dp[1][4][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the specific index in the `dp` array.

The values of the other variables `N`, `M`, `s`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `dp` array and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `s` is at least 4, `j` is 3, `k` is 1, `i` is equal to 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `dp[1][4][k]` is assigned the value 1.**
