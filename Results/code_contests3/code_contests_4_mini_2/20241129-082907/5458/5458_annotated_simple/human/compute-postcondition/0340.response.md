Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists initially set to [[0], [0]]. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is updated to [[0], [0], [0]], and `dp[1][1][2]` is set to 1. If `j` is less than `k`, `dp` remains unchanged as [[0], [0]]. If `i` is not 0, `dp` remains unchanged as [[0], [0]] due to an index out of bounds error preventing assignment.***
