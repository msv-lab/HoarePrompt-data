Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, and if `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1.***
