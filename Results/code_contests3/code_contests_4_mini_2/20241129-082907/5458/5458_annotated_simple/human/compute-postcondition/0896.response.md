According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `m`. If `j` is less than or equal to `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 1 since the loop starts from 1 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` would be incremented by 1, making it 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `s` is the final value of `k`, `k` is equal to `s`, for the loop to execute a second time `j` must be less than or equal to 2.**
