According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute again if `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3 and `s` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being 4. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 4.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 4, `k` is 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 2**
