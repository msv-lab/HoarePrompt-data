Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. If `i` is not 0, `k` is `s + 1`, and `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it.***
