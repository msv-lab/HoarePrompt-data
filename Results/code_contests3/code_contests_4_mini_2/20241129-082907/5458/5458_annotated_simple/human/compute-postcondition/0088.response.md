According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. Given that `s` is at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. To execute the loop a second time, `k` needs to be increased to 2. 

For the loop to execute again, `s` must be at least 2 (since it needs to support the upper limit of `s + 1` which is now 3). 

Therefore, the updated state is as follows:
State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, `mod` is 100000, `j` is at least 3 plus the number of iterations executed, `s` is at least 1, for the loop to execute a second time `k` must be 2.**
