The code assigns the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` from `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`. The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` is taken without modification, while `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is now set to that value. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment, and their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` must be `s + 1`, and the assignment has been made.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `k` must be `s + 1`, and the assignment has been made.**
