The code `continue` does not change the values of the variables but causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration. Therefore, the output state reflects that we are continuing to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
