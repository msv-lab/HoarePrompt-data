Postcondition: ***`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least the maximum value of `S`, and `k` is less than `S`. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value 1. If `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.***
