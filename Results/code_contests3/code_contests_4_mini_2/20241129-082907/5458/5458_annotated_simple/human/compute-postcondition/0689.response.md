Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 2. If `j` is greater than `k`, the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated to the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]` and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
