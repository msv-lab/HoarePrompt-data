Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists that has been updated based on the conditions set in the loop. If `j` is greater than `k`, the list `dp` is updated based on the specified indices, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `j` is not greater than `k`, the program does not update `dp` and exits the current iteration of the loop.***
