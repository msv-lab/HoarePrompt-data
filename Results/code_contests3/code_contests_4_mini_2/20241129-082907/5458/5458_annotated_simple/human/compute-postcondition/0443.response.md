The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` is assigning the value `1` to a specific index of the list `dp`. 

To break it down:
- `i` is equal to `2`, therefore `i + 1` equals `3`. The bitwise AND operation with `1` results in `3 & 1`, which evaluates to `1` (as the least significant bit of `3` is `1`).
- `j` is equal to `2`, so `j + 1` equals `3`.
- `k` is equal to `3`.

Thus, the assignment translates to:
`dp[1][3][3] = 1`

This assignment will update the value at that specific index in the `dp` list. Other variables remain unchanged.

The Output State is: `dp` has been updated at index `[1][3][3]` to `1`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.

Output State: **`dp` has been updated at index `[1][3][3]` to `1`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, and `k` is 3.**
