Postcondition: ***`dp` is a fully updated list of lists, `j` is `m + 1`, `s` is at least 1, and `i` is 0. If `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `dp` is updated at indices [i + 1 & 1][m + 2][k] with the value derived from `dp[i & 1][m + 1][k - (m + 1)] % mod`, while `j` is greater than `k`.***
