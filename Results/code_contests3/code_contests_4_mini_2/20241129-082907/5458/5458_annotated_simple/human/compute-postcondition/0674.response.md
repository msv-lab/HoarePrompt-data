Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][3][1]` is set to 1. If `i` is 1, a modification attempt was made on `dp[0][3][1]`, but it encountered an invalid index `dp[1][2][-1]`.***
