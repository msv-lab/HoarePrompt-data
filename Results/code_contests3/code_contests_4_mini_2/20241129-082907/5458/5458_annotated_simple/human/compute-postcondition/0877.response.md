According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. If `k` is less than or equal to `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is currently at its maximum of `s` or less. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be `s + 1`, and the conditions based on `i` and `j` will remain relevant.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, for the loop to execute one more time `k` must be `s + 1`**
