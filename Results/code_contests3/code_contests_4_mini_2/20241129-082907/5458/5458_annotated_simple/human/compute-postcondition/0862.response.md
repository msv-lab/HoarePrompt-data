Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is either 0 or 2, `j` is at least 1, `s` is the final value after all iterations, `k` is equal to `s`, and `dp` is fully updated for all values of `j` from 1 to `m` and `k` from 1 to `s`. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is set to 1. If `i` is 2 and `j` is greater than `k`, `dp[1][j + 1][k]` will hold the value of `dp[1][j][k] % mod`. Otherwise, `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` will be updated based on previous values according to the loop's conditions.**
