The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
