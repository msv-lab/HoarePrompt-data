The values of the variables do not change but we continue with the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp` is updated such that `dp[1][3][3]` is equal to `dp[1][2][3]`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3 and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
