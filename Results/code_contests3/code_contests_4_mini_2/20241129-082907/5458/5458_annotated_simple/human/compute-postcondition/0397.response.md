Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists, where if `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][4][1]` is set to 1, `m` is at least 2, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 1, and `k` is 1. If `j` is less than `k`, no changes occur in the variables. If `i` is not 0, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by 0, resulting in no change in the variables.***
