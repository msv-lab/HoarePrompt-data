According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and the upper limit defined by `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is equal to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented to the next value, which is `s + 1`, and since the loop's range is from 1 to `s`, `k` must be less than or equal to `s`. 

Since `k` is currently `s + 1`, it cannot execute again as it exceeds the upper limit. Hence, there will be no next iteration unless `s` is increased. 

State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time `s` must be increased to at least `k` (which is currently `s + 1)`**
