The value at `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value `1`. The expression `i + 1 & 1` will evaluate to either `1` or `0` based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is `0`, `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1`. The variable `j` is incremented by `1`, thus `j + 1` moves to the next integer. The previous state of `k` is also unchanged and remains within the bounds set by `s`. Therefore, we can conclude the following output state: `dp` has been updated at the index `[1][j + 1][k]` to `1`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is updated at index `[1][j + 1][k]` to `1`, `i` is 0, `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is less than or equal to `s**.
