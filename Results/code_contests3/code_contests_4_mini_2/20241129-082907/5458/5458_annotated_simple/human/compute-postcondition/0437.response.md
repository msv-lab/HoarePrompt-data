The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the current iteration of the nearest enclosing loop. Since the values of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` and the other variables remain unchanged, the output state is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `k` equal to 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, with `i` equal to 2, `j` equal to 2, `k` equal to 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
