Output State: **`dp` is a fully updated list of lists based on the conditions specified in the loop, with dimensions [2][m + 1][s + 1]. The values in `dp` depend on the relationships established through the iterations, particularly the conditions involving `j`, `k`, and `i`. `i` is either 0 or 1, depending on the last iteration executed, and `j` ranges from 1 to `m`, while `k` ranges from 1 to `s`.**
