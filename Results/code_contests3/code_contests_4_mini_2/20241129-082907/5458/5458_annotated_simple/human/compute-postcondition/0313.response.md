The code assigns values to the variables `n`, `m`, and `s` by reading input and splitting it into three integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `s` are unknown since they will be replaced by the input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables have been assigned new values based on the input.

Output State: **The output is the value of `dp[n]`; `n`, `m`, and `s` are assigned new integer values from input.**
