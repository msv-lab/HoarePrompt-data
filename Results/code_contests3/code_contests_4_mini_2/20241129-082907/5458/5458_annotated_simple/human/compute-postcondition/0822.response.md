The statement `continue` does not change the values of any variables but instead causes the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one. Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is either 0 or at least 1, `j` is 3, `s` is at least 3, `k` is 3, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
