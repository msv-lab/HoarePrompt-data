According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `k` is less than or equal to `s`, and since `k` is being incremented by 1 in the next iteration, we have to ensure that `k` is now set to the next value.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` was less than or equal to `s`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be incremented to the next value, which will be `k + 1`. Since `k` started from 1, for the loop to execute again, `k` must now be 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, for the loop to execute a second time `k` is 2, and `k` must be less than or equal to `s`**
