To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the operation inside the `print` statement step by step.

1. The variable `i` is defined as `N^2`, which means `i` holds the value of `N` squared. 
2. The variable `j` is defined as `M + 1`, meaning `j` is one more than the value of `M`.
3. The variable `k` is defined as `S`, which holds its original value.
4. The code `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` accesses a specific index of the `dp` array based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `s`.
   - `n ** 2 & 1` evaluates to the bitwise AND operation between `N^2` and `1`. This operation determines whether `N^2` is even or odd:
     - If `N` is odd, `N^2` is odd, and `N^2 & 1` results in `1`.
     - If `N` is even, `N^2` is even, and `N^2 & 1` results in `0`.
5. Thus, the index accessed in `dp` is either `0` or `1` based on whether `N` is even or odd.
6. The second index is `M + 1`, which has already been defined as `j`.
7. The third index is `S`, which has been defined as `k`.
8. The result of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s]` is then taken modulo `mod`, which is defined as `100000`.

Since the specific values of `N`, `M`, `S`, and the contents of `dp` are not provided, we can only describe the output in a general sense.

Output State: **The output is the value of `dp[n ** 2 & 1][m + 1][s] % mod`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 7, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ 2000, `s` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 3000, and `mod` is 100000.**
