According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute for values of `k` ranging from 1 to `s`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1. 

Before the loop starts, `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, and `j` is 1, but these variables do not directly affect the execution of the loop since the loop is dependent on the variable `s`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Additionally, at the start of the loop, `k` will be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1**
