The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop or statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000, `S` is at least 3, `mod` is 100000, `k` is 3, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop or if statement.
