The statement involves updating a multi-dimensional array `dp` based on previous values and given conditions. 

The expression `dp[i + 1 & 1]` calculates the index for `i`, which is `2 + 1 & 1 = 0` (since `2 & 1` equals `0`). 

Next, the code updates `dp[0][j + 1][k]` by adding the value of `dp[1][j][k - j] % mod`. The variables `j` and `k` are affected by the conditions: `j` is greater than `k`, and `k` is 1. Therefore, `k - j` would result in a negative index unless `j` is equal to 1 or less, making this operation undefined in a typical context. 

Assuming valid indices for the `dp` array are managed elsewhere, the specific impact on `dp` can be summarized with the given constraints. 

The output state reflects the changes in the indices and the operation performed on the `dp` array, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than `k`, `s` is at least 1, `k` is now 1; `dp[0][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[1][j][k - j] % mod`.**
