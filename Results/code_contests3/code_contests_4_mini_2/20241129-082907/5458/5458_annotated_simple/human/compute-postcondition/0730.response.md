According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since it is stated that `s` is at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, `k` is initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range `xrange(1, s + 1)`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, and `j`) do not affect the execution of this loop directly since they are not used in the loop condition or body.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed the first time, `k` should be set to 1, and `s` must be at least 1.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, for the loop to execute the first time `s` is at least 1**
