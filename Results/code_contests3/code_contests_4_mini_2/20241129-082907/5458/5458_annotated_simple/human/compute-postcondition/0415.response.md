Postcondition: ***`dp` is a list of lists with `m` at least 2, `j` equal to 3, `s` at least 3, and `k` equal to 3. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp` is modified at indices `[0][4][3]` or `[1][4][3]` to 1. If `i` is not 0, `dp[i + 1 & 1][4][3]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][3][0] % mod` to it, while `j`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
