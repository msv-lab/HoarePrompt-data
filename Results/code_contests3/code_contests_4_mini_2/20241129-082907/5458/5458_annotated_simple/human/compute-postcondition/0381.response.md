The variable `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value. The value of `j` is greater than `k`, which suggests that the operation involves accessing a previous value of `dp` that may not exist in this context, as `k - j` would be negative. However, since the assignment involves a modulo operation, the output state will reflect the assignment even though it may not compute a valid index. Therefore, the other variable states remain unaffected.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to its previous value, where `j` is greater than `k`.**
