Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, `s` is at least 1, `k` is 1, and `dp` is updated such that if `j` is greater than `k`, then `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, allowing the program to continue to the next iteration of the loop.***
