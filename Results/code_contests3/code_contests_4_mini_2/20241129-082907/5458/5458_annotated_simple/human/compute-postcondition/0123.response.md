According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1, and `s` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1.

Currently, `k` is 1, so for the loop to execute a second time, `k` must be 2. Additionally, `s` must be at least 2 for the loop condition `k <= s` to hold true.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 2, and `s` is at least 2 for the loop to execute a second time.**
