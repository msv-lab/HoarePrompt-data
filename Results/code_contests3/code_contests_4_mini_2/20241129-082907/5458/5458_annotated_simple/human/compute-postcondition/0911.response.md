The statement `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the 3D list `dp` at the indices `i + 1 & 1`, `j + 1`, and `k`. The previous values of the variables are as follows: 

- `i` is equal to `0`, so `i + 1 & 1` evaluates to `1 & 1`, which equals `1`.
- `j` can either be `1` or `2`, so `j + 1` will be `2` or `3`.
- `k` is equal to `s + 1`, and since `s` is at least `2`, `k` is at least `3`.

Thus, the potential indices for the assignment are:

- The first index is `1`.
- The second index can be `2` or `3`.
- The third index is at least `3`.

The assignment does not change the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, or `k`, but it modifies the value in the `dp` array.

The Output State is: `n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is equal to 0; and `dp[1][2][k]` or `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s + 1`; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is equal to 0; and `dp[1][2][k]` or `dp[1][3][k]` is set to 1.**
