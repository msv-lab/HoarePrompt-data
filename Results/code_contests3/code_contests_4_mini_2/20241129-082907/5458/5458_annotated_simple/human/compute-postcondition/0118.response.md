The values of the variables do not change but we continue to the next iteration of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
