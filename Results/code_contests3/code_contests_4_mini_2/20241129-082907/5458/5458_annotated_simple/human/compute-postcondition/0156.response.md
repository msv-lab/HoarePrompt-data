According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k` and the value of `s`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `s + 1`, so it will execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 2, and since `s` is at least 2, the loop can execute one more time.

After this iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 3. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer, `s` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, for the loop to execute a second time `s` must be greater than or equal to 3**.
