The value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated by adding the value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod` to it. The previous value of `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on the previous value of `dp[i & 1][j][k - j]` and then taken modulo `mod`. The states of the other variables, including `dp[i + 1 & 1][j][k]`, and `dp[i][j][k]`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1 & 1][j + 1][k]` is updated based on `dp[i & 1][j][k - j] % mod`**
