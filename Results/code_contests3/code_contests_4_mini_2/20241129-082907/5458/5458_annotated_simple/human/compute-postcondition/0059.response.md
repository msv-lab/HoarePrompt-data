The values of the variables do not change, but the `continue` statement is executed, which skips the current iteration of the loop we are in. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is 1, `M` is a positive integer between 2 and 2000, `S` is at least 1, `mod` is 100000, `k` is `S + 1`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
