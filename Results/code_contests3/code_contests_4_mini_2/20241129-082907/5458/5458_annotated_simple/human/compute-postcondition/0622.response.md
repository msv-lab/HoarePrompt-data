In this case, the loop is a `while 1` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless interrupted by a break statement or a termination condition within the loop body, which is not provided here. As such, there is no need to adjust the states since the loop is designed to execute one more time without any specific conditions that would prevent it from doing so.

State: **`dp` is a list of lists fully updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, with dimensions [2][m + 1][s + 1]; `i` is either 0 or 1; `m` is the total number of iterations for `j`; `s` is the total number of iterations for `k`; the value printed is `dp[n`**
