Output State: **`n`, `m`, `s` are at least 2; `k` is equal to `s`; `j` is either 1 or 2; `i` is equal to 1 or 0; `dp` contains values based on the relations defined in the loop, with `dp[1][j + 1][k]` being set to 1 if `j` is greater than or equal to `k` when `i` is 0, and being updated otherwise based on previous states.**
