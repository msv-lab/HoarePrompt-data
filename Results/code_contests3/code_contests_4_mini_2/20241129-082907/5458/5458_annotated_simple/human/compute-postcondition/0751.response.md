Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `s` is at least 2, `k` is 2. If `i` is 0 and `j` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `dp[1][j + 1][2]` is assigned the value 1. If `i` is not 0, the operation on `dp` does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `s`, or `k`.***
